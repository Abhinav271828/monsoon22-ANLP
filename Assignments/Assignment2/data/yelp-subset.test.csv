3,"Best hangover food on the planet! Their Macho Beef Burrito is fantastic! I like all of their Mexican items as well, but the burgers and American fare is just OK, nothing to talk about one way or another. Its clean and bright inside if you decided to dine in."
4,Really fresh sake. Great rolls. Nice option to get a half or a full roll. Delicious lychee sake. Fast service. Amazing!
4,"Awesome! Tons of new and used here. CDs, DVDs, bluerays and albums - that have it all. Staff is very friendly."
1,"I went on the indoor ride and we shared a gondola with random people. This was a slight mistake because they were silent the entire time and weren't up for having fun, plus the guy had a huge disgusting wart on his temple that I couldn't stop staring at. Um.\n\nThe gondolier was wonderful. He was really nice, really talkative, had a great voice. He made it fun. But the gondola ride itself, enhhhh. I go in for cheesy fun touristy ripoff stuff like this all the time, but I wouldn't recommend this. It looks way more fun than it is and costs far too much for the level of fun that you have. When you reach the turnaround point, you'll think to yourself, THAT'S IT?? And yes, that's it. Seriously. It's nowhere near as exciting as you'd think it would be. Outdoor one is supposed to be better, so maybe go for that instead. The indoor one can be skipped."
0,"Wow, is there a negative 12 star? Seriously, the only accurate word to describe this place = Ghetto!\nMy GF booked a room here for her hockey tournament, thinking cheaper is better. This place is a rats nest! Cigarette holes in all the bedding, a putrid vomit tinge in the hallways, and the bathroom? Wow. All the towels were stained, and the shower curtain looks like a Petrie dish mold experiment! A new coat of napalm might help the walls and ceiling in there! If she hadn't paid up front we'd be out of this crap hole. Forgot to mention the drunk, sloth of a woman screaming at her man friend at 4 in the morning. Good times!"
3,"Overall pretty decent.  While the pricing is good, the portioning is commensurate with that pricing.  Overall it was pretty good, but since the portions were a little on the small side, you were left wanting.  The ribeye looked like a the same size as you would get with steak and eggs, and the file was maybe 5 or 6 oz.  The bar looks worthwhile and they happy hour specials looked to be of good value."
4,"Great service, very enjoyable atmosphere and amazing food! \nWe went right at 5 o'clock and sat at the hibachi. We were very pleased that they allowed us to go ahead and have hibachi even though it was just 2 of us. Our chef, Joe, was super fun and nice. \nWill definitely being returning!"
3,"Typical local bar, but I'd say it's nicer than most. The drinks are cold and food is descent. The pizzas are pretty good, and even better during happy hour. The wings are good as well. Nice spot to hangout after work."
2,"Busy Busy Busy!  Seems like everytime I go there is a line out the door.  Our entrees were good as usual, and I don't mind the wait.\n\nIf  you don't like to wait in line to order your food, you might want to consider calling ahead to order and pick up your food.\n\nThe location is usually very clean, loud either from the music or people talking, but there's also an outdoor area you can eat at.\n\nThey have very good guacamole for a fast food place, and the tortilla chips have a lime-salt flavor that accompanies the guacamole really well."
3,"The bruschetta is tasty and a great starter.\n\nThe Oregano's Salad (hold the olives) is just bomb. Order the small and it's enough for 3 adults.\n\nWe ordered the BBQ chicken pizza (added pineapple) and it was tasty. The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh, and it's not greasy.\n\nThe servers are upbeat, fast, and knowledgeable.\n\nThe menu is kind of huge and you can skip over things easily, but do NOT miss the warm cookie pie for dessert.\n\nPS - if you are cold and sitting outside, ask for a blanket...they've got them!"
0,"Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care, go to the store on University Ave"
4,"I've held off writing a review of Elements simply because I've never actually eaten off the house menu. This review is based on the sheer awesomeness of how Executive Chef Beau Macmillan runs the place and the amazing opportunities that he provides. \n\nDuring the summer Elements hosts a Lunch and Learn, where they bring in top notch chefs from around the valley, as well as celebrity chefs like Robert Irvine. \n\nI attended a Lunch and Learn event hosted by Geoffrey Zakarian, judge on Chopped and all around groovy guy. Over the course of several hours he whipped up three amazing courses (with wine pairings), demonstrating how to make each dish and answering questions. the atmosphere was relaxed and fun. Chef Macmillan was also there to answer questions and make jokes as well. What an amazing day! \n\nWhile at the lunch I made reservations for another event, the Table for 12 dinner. Essentially 12 people dine in a private room that is directly off the kitchen, with only a few glass doors separating you from the chaos. the chef of the evening was Petite Maisons' own James Porter. \n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say this was the most enjoyable dining experience of my life. The setting was intimate, Chefs Macmillan and Porter were on hand to discuss the courses, food in general and any other topic came up. The passion that they feel for food really came through. \n\nThe food was amazing, the wine was perfect and the company could not be beat. Hanging out in The Jade bar afterwards with the staff was entertaining and educational (thanks David for the taco shop suggestions!). \n\nI'm completely blown away that Elements provides such amazing experiences. Based on this experience I will definitely return to Elements, and I'm headed for Petite Maison. \n\nTruly amazing"
1,"I have to second Elysia E's review of Lindo in Henderson.... I'm a huge fan of the Sahara and Eastern location and almost all others, but my entire party was disappointed with our experience here.\n\nIt has been said that the building they took over was formerly an Italian location with a fantastic view of the city and Lindo seems like they put up some cheap decor and painted the walls.  The location on Sahara and Eastern makes you feel like your in a traditional cantina with a bevy of fine tequila's and hispanic culture.  \n\nOnward to the food.... My girlfriend order the chimichangas which were a huge disappointment and had to be sent back.  We try to never send back food from both working in the restaurant industry.  Furthermore, my carne asada was tough and chewy.  I still ate my weight in bean and salsa dip along with everyone else.  \n\nI just would love to see the same consistency at the Henderson location that I'm used to from Lindo.  Not to worry..... I still plan on stopping in for fresh made tortillas often :)"
0,"I'm really glad these tickets were free because I knew it was a dud the first 10 minutes of him going on and on just talking about the whole 'mentalist' background. This show couldn't have been over soon enough, a real disappointment and not at all entertaining. Skip it!"
0,"nothing good happens at club rehab lol\nHampton Beach NH is the same, just add cocaine and E-junkies make the world go round-keep rollin crackheads"
2,"Yummy food for a great price,  but I wished the service was faster.  The wait for a table can be long,  and also to get the check.  Although the food was delish.  I recommend the grilled whole squid,  the grilled salmon collar, and for sure---the honey toast dessert  **a must try**"
1,"overpriced and got poor service. the layout and decor is hodgepodge of nightclub, bar and restaurant but does not hit the mark on any of them. pre-game mixed drinks for $10? sorry! I was hoping to catch some of the nba finals game 1 before heading to the d-backs game but couldn't wait to get out of there. TVs in the open bar area were tiny old standard def sets. what the? the \""nicer\"" bar area with bigger HD sets was closed. the frickin nba finals are on! hello! sports bar? bah."
4,"I started the process to find a carpet cleaning service by asking friends.  None of my friends were really happy with the last place they tried so I hit Yelp and called 4 or 5 places.  I selected Epic based on the reviews I read and their professionalism when I called.  i ended up booking them to do my carpets and my couches.  When the guy arrived (on time), he cleaned the carpets and they looked terrific.  He then went and looked at my couches very carefully and advised me that the labels said that it needed to be dry cleaned.  He discussed the situation with me and I decided to wait.  They had another worker who specialized in dry cleaning the couches and I scheduled him for 2 days later.  When he arrived, he read the label and checked the fabric and explained the differences in the two procedures.  I decided to go ahead and steam clean them and they looked amazing when he finished and dried beautifully.  I appreciated how careful both technicians were and that they cared that I was happy with their work.  Also, I received followup calls after both services to make sure that I was happy with the service.  I will definitely use this company again and have already recommended them to others."
4,"Great place for dinner.. Arrived at about 7:30 the place was packed we expected it would be a long wait and thought about finding another place for dinner. We walked in and were greeted warmly by the hostess told her we were two for dinner and she said just wait one minute . Brad a new recruit who had literally started that day showed us to our table.\nThe place was very lively with many families and couples enjoying each other's company and the delicious foods that were delivered to their tables by the extremely well trained and efficient staff. The waitstaff work like a well oiled machine and flited about the room with smiles, the open kitchen environment that housed the wood burning oven put on an awesome show. \nOur waitresses name was Tara she was fabulous and treated us as if we were the only table she had explaining the menu to us with patience and expertly answered all of our questions. She is a student and has been working there for four years.. She is a definite asset to your team! \nWe are on vacation in Arizona for the first time and really were searching for a great authentic place to have pizza and Italian fare. This place is definitely worth a repeat visit when we return\nExcellent food and service!"
2,"Quite an interesting concept that I had not been privy to trying before finding it randomly on a lunch break in the heart of upper Phoenix. \n\nLet's get the complaint out of the way early. If this place is half Mexican, then you need to have some salsa or some Mexican sauce next to the soy sauce. Alot of food I found myself pouring soy sauce on because it lacked a bit of a punch and flavor. If they can pull that off, then things would be alot better because my veggie quesadilla was solid, but using soy sauce on that product was not the best choice. The plain fried rice was exactly what I wanted and although they only have a handful of chicken breast choices, the one I picked was good. It was with the green sauce and ginger combo and I ordered that in the combination with that quesadilla for about eight bucks. They probably don't need that sampling station in the front either, it just looks cheesy. Of course, the snickerdoodle cookie was a nice surprise and very tasty, that item may be worth buying a dozen, but maybe sneak your own hot sauce in the place if you want some extra flavor."
2,Service Fry's & Fry's Marketplace FAIR enough.Price............HONEST so. Best for weekly  shopping like me...little but every Friday it got festive look.
4,"Went here on Sunday morning, Dec. 11th about 9am. We had about a five minute wait as it was really slow in Vegas this weekend. Normally I would expect to wait much longer at any restaurant or buffet on a Sunday for breakfast. \n\nWe shared the corn-beef skillet, a side of bisquits and gravy, the pistachio mocha drink and the caramel all over everything drink. Our server/bartender/barista was Kye and she handles everything back there no problem. She was also quick to point out that we should save some bisquit for the home-made peach preserves. Guess they put something different out all the time. The food was great, the corned beef was incredible and we had absolutely no questions asked about sharing a meal. \n\nMy experience was very good and I would definately recommend it AND go back for seconds."
1,"I travel often and like to stay at Delta Hotel's because of their commitment to customer service. Im fact, I am a \""Gold\"" member of their loyalty program. However, this location has proven to be an exception. Sub-par service. The elevators were broken during my entire visit. The facilities are dated. The bathrooms are tiny. The only good thing about this hotel is its location. There are lots of options for hotels in downtown Montreal - I recommend you stay somewhere else."
0,Completely disappointed that this course failed to provide notice they were closed. If you are going to be working on the course and the entire facility is going to be unavailable you should consider posting it on your website.
1,"Panchero's Mexican Grill looked interesting to eat at, I love how they prepare their tortilla's in the big presser they have - but that's the only thing that impressed me; the tortilla's... Since they're freshly made, they're still yummy and \""gooey\"" - The staff was really nice when we entered, and was attentive to what we wanted for our orders :)\n\nI got a pretty basic burrito but was disappointed at the rice, the other two people in our party compared it to Uncle Ben's rice, the steak we got seemed \""boiled\"", the medium salsa wasn't as spicy as I thought it was (but they do have a counter filled with different hot sauces; of course I grabbed the Tapat\u00edo), although the salsa was flavorful. My friends had ordered a chicken quesadilla - they were good but not great. It seemed they only had Montery Jack as their cheese. The prices were pretty decent, I think next time I will try something else though!"
1,"We had dinner here for four. Had an artichoke appetizer with pita chips, club sandwich and shared a huge sundae for dessert. The service was awesome; space impressive. But, I have to say that when a gem from NYC gets transported to Vegas, and gets \""blown up\"" into Vegas standards with all the glam, size, \""in your face\"", and over-the-top stuff that makes Vegas what it is, that NYC gem looses something and just isn't the same. \n\nWe were looking to be awed by this chocolate place and weren't. Maybe we should have ordered some chocolate pieces?"
2,"We all know, I have a soft spot for secondhand bookshops. Besides being cheap and cheerful, they usually offer you access to all kinds of weird and wonderful stories that you might never stumble across otherwise. \n\nWhat distinguishes DL's Book Exchange from all the other secondhand shops scattered across the city, is that they offer customers the oppurtunity to swap or exchange books. All their hardbacks and paperbacks are priced at \u00a33 but the owner guarantees that if you can't get past the first chapter of any, you're welcome to bring them back and get \u00a31.50 off your next book. \n\nAdmittedly, you're unlikely to find any Pultizer Prize winners on the shelf but I did spot some cool writers and pulp noirs amidst the factual books and rom-coms."
3,Usually I'm a Starbucks girl but the Iced Chocolate Coffee I had was delicious! I look forward to trying more things!
4,"The most amazing show I've ever seen. Burlesque meets gymnastic meets comedy.  I would see absinthe over and over. There's no bad seat in the house, it was so close and intimate. Must see in Vegas!"
2,"Looking for a good place to go when you're craving authentic Mexican food but don't want to pay high prices at some Mexican sit-down restaurant or pay really cheap prices for questionable Mexican fare at a fast-food establishment? Search no further because Fausto's is that place plus more. The employees are nice, the food is made-to-order, the menu is simple and inexpensive, and there's a complimentary condiments bar complete with pickled veggies (jalapenos, carrots & onions), fresh cucumber & radish slices, and two types of salsa (mild tomatillo & a spicy red salsa). Sure, the ambiance may be lacking, but that's okay because you can just order your food to-go. You can order food a la carte (located on the menu above the counter) or you can order a combo which comes with an entree and sides of Mexican-style rice & refried beans. The combo menu is posted on the side wall adjacent to the counter, and it is composed of images of the food, making it easier to choose what you want to eat. I've been here multiple times, and everything that I have ordered so far has been good. Here's what I've ordered:\n\nChimichanga combo plate: A humongous flour tortilla burrito stuffed with shredded beef, onions & bell peppers, then fried to golden perfection and topped with sour cream on one half & guacamole on the other, along with a nice layer of melted cheese. The plate comes with a side of rice & refried beans, as well as a small serving of pico de gallo ( I assume to bring some sort of healthy to the dish). \n\nShredded Beef combo plate: The shredded beef is the same concoction as the shredded beef inside the chimichanga, but instead of it being encased in a fried tortilla, the meat is served all by itself with sides of refried beans & rice, and your choice of freshly made corn or flour tortillas, which you can use to make mini burritos. The tortillas are wrapped in foil to keep warm. I prefer the flour tortillas over the corn because they have better texture, are bigger & taste better. Store-bought flour tortillas can't compare to the fresh-made tortillas at Fausto's. \n\nSuper Nachos: Heart-attack on a plate! But so addicting & super good. I usually ask for the toppings (meat of your choice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes & cheese; I may be forgetting something) on the side to prevent the fried flour tortilla chips from becoming soft. The chips are oily and they layer on the toppings, so be warned- Addicting, yet so bad for you. \n\nTacos: I love the tacos because of the way Fausto's prepares the shell. I think they fry the whole taco after stuffing the tortilla with meat & cheese, resulting in a very crispy shell. They then take the fried taco and add lettuce & a another type of cheese (crumbly, reminiscent of feta). I like to add salsa to the taco, which makes the taco juicy & yummy. \n\nI haven't had a bad experience with Fausto's yet, so I do recommend this place. The next time you're searching for good Mexican food at inexpensive prices and large portions, then stop by Fausto's and try some of their menu items."
1,"Decent for the money, but not spectacular. Wings were overcooked and dry. \n\nThe western bacon burger was decent. Bread was good."
3,"Groupon brought us here with $8 to spend last night.  I got the Chocolate malted crunch ice cream sandwiched by homemade chocolate chip pecan cookies!   Yum yum.  Earl isn't much of a dessert person but he could not stop raving about his ice cream sandwich, which was the pistachio ice cream with the chocolate brownie.  Those were $3 each so we had another $2 to spend.  We spent it on 3 cookies and devour those cookies tonight after dinner and they were still chewy and delicious.\n\nWe will be coming back to Sweet Addiction when we are in the Spring Valley area!"
0,"Went today to try the 50% off deal. Now this place is close to my house, I have been going for many years. I just decided to go during the promo, I pull up like normally, I noticed there were no cars. I did think this was odd. I turned my car off after the guy directed me in. I go to get out and he ask me to scoot up... Turn my car back up and move up 2inches. I then tell the guy I want the ultimate with the 50% off because it's 3pm. He tells me I need to back out and get into line (4-5cars lined up) or he can take me at without discount. He said they don't start until exactly 3pm... It was 3:02. Then why would you make me pull up? Obviously I did not know. GOOD customer service would direct the cars in and just take mine when they were finished.  I will never go out. They don't value their customers at all."
2,"This hotel is one of my backup hotels when I make impromptu trips to Vegas. (U know.. Thinking about going two days before the weekend!!)\n\nRooms are clean, service is great (they are accommodating), not too far from the strip (like a 5 minute drive), plenty of access to food and the Las Vegas outlets. \n\nNever any complaints. Keep up the great work guys!!"
3,We wanted to try this place because we had a coupon. We haven't been here before. It was a nice place. The food was pretty good and the service was ok. \n\nWe can't wait to come back again.
2,"Decent venue.\n\nWouldn't be my top choice by far, but it's good as a first spot to stop by or a last stop.  I got flagged down by a promoter handing out wristbands out on the Strip earlier during the day.  He gave me some wristbands and ensured me that I would get reduced cover and a line cut. Females would get comped in...Ended up paying $20 cover (instead of $40) with some free drink tickets, so not a bad deal at all. We got in super fast, so no complaints.  Not a bad option at 2:30am!\n\nClub plays open format (mainly hip-hop) so if you or your group are anti-EDM, Haze would definitely be a viable option. Club has main floor and upper level tables. I didn't do bottle service here, so i can't comment on that. But Haze is managed by the Light Group, and I know they have great deals at 1OAK, so I'm thinking it's the same at Haze as well. Crowd here is similar to the one at Pure. \n\nI used up my drink tickets, but shots of Hennessy and Patron were $15 a piece. Just about average for Vegas prices. Club wasn't jammed packed, so it was easy to buy drinks.\n\nReally 3.5 stars, but I can't see myself going back unless it was a last club of the night option or I got comped in for free. Not bad, but theres so much more in Vegas!"
1,"High marks for the tasty pizza, but beware the build your own option!  We ordered a 14\"" thin crust with chicken, roasted red bell pepper, mushrooms, and feta, and the bill came out to $27.50!  I ordered from their online menu, which did not list the price of these ingredients. If I knew it would be that expensive, I would not have ordered it. I spoke with the manager who apologized for those prices not being listed on website, but stopped short of doing anything to make it right, apparently unconcerned about losing a 17 year customer. We like their pizza but there are other excellent, less pricy options we'll choose next time."
0,"Rude staff. They don't turn anyone away, but then rush people through and provide substandard service. I was not happy with the manicure but when I expressed this to the owner, she just argued back, wanted to charge me again to fix the paint, and was terribly rude. Given, that there are nail salons in every strip mall, no need to put up with rudeness or sloppiness that happens here."
3,"I'm a fan. I've been here a few times and more often than not, all the food I get is pretty good, if not great (at least for an AYCE place). Their AYCE menu is fairly large. The dinner price is $26.95 and for kids it's about $13.\n\nMost of the nigiri I've tried was good, with standouts being the tuna, super white tuna, sea bream, yellowtail and eel. Other items on their menu that I'm a fan of include their gyoza, the yellowtail lover roll, and crispy rice with spicy tuna. Their oysters and pork belly are decent and worth ordering again.\n\nI wasn't a fan of the seared tuna in AJ sauce or the Hawaiian roll.\n\nThe interior is cool with the long communal tables and benches. It also seems to be easier to get a seat than other AYCE places around town. The times I went I've never had to wait, which is perfect when my patience is running low, I'm hungry, and all I want to do is stuff my face."
1,"Great vibe and atmosphere, locally owned/operated, uses fair trade and (in most cases) organic ingredients - all wins.\n\nHowever... as Julia noted, the service has dropped quite a bit as of late.  I was in this morning to purchase a single cup of coffee to go.  The person behind the counter didn't acknowledge my entry (there were 2 people in the place), and I honestly waited more than 10 minutes for her to complete everything else she was doing before she asked what she could get for me... \n\n10 minutes may not seem like a long time, but when you swing-in while on your way to work, those ten minutes seem like an eternity.  Especially when it's for a $2 cup of to-go coffee... she could've rang-me-up and handed me a cup in a minute or less.  \n\nAnd, the cookies have gone downhill big time - hard and crispy rather than soft and chewy... ick.  \n\nNot sure if I'll be back - I can buy a whole pound of Just Coffee from Willy Street for $8, and if I have to wait 10 minutes for a single cup, I can spend that time brewing it at home just as easily...\n\nSorry, Tuvalu - it's \""toot-a-loo\"" for me.  Best wishes."
2,We randomly stumbled upon it on Sunday night/Monday morning. Had no idea it was a club let alone a restaurant.\nIts a small dimly lit circular room that offers a crazy variety of music.\n\nthe con here was they expected ladies to pay $20 for entrance with the promise of free drinks all night.. Since when do ladies ever need to pay in Vegas?\n(we ended up getting in free)\n\nEnded up having a decent time
0,"Kids wanted Mexican......sooooo glad we got a discount offer for this place. I would've been UPSET if I had to pay full price for their \""mexican food.\""  I know it's a chain, but it wasn't good at all.....  Service SUCKED!  Had to wait to be seated.......wait to get drinks ordered........wait to get food ordered.  Our server was MIA, someone else took our order & brough it out to us.  Other staff got our drinks....our server only checked on us once or twice.  We were starving.....ate what we could and left!  Never will we go back!! Sooooo many better places to try.....stay away!!"
1,"This place serves Werner Enterprises truck drivers. I know cause I'm one of them. It's just the basics for what we need. I've stayed in worse places. So if you like a 5 star hotel, go somewhere else. It's a 2 star maybe a soft 3 star hotel. But there are plenty of food places within walking distance."
0,"First of all the only reason it gets the one star is the waitress. I can't remember her name but she was great! Now to the review. To start off there was little to no wait which was great. The hostess staff is pretty rude and not very helpful at all!I was in a party of 10, we asked for a table that was open closer to the buffet and she said no because she was going in line to who got there and we were not first. Well um you were seating us right then so yes I would say we were first! Carrying on..\n\nWhen I got up to the buffet I was amazed by how much stuff was there. My first choice was the blackened salmon. HUGE MISTAKE as it was pretty raw! It was terrible!! I grabbed a few other items that were pretty sub par too. The sushi was also warm and tasted terrible!! After almost gagging on that plate I figured I would hit up the crab and shrimp. First piece of crab I grabbed was covered in curly hair! Now I know this crab did not get a Jerry curl after being killed so someone forgot their hairnet! YUCK YUCK YUCK!! the other pieces I took were rubbery and tasted pretty bad. Shrimp was OK. Prime rib was my next stop after. I was hoping to say something good about that but with the salt content on  it I just can't :( There was really not a whole lot I can say I enjoyed here. I left feeling gross and mad that I had paid well over $100 bucks for this crap!! I tried to speak to a manager but the hostess told me to get over it and leave. I did not even have a chance!! When I tried to explain that I was feeling sick and that my friend got up several times during our meal to get sick she told me to stop whining and leave already! I have worked in hotels and as a hostess at a buffet before and have never in my life would i ever dream of talking to someone like that!! \n\nTerrible just Terrible! Next time I am in Vegas this is one place I will not be going back to!!"
0,"I recently attended Studio Movie Grill for the first time... I will not be returning to this theater again and I am surprised they are still in business. I bought a groupon over a year ago and forgot that I had purchased them. I read on the groupon that the amount I spent on the tickets would still be validated through Studio Movie Grill, however, the actual groupon purchased for 2 tickets and 2 drinks for 10.00 would not be validated. My understanding was that I would have 10.00 to spend at the theater. When I logged onto my groupon for the day to print the tickets I noticed they had the same promotion going on for the 2 tickets and 2 small drinks. I figured I would call the theater to see if they may honor what I purchased through groupon since they were currently offering the same \""newer\"" promotion. I called the theater several times and they do NOT have anyone answering phones. I tried all of the automated numbers and not a single human answered the phone. They offer to call you back but I took my break at work to call and cannot receive calls at work seeing as I work in a hospital with patients and I am constantly on my feet. So my coworker and I decided to see the Purge on Tuesday night at 520pm. We grabbed a nice happy hour at the Four Peaks nearby and went over to the theater at 5:10pm. Upon arrival to the front \""purchase\"" desk, I asked the girl if they would consider honoring my expired groupon since they were doing the same promotion presently. She looked confused mummbled something, said I dont know and than began to charge us the full price for the movies. I decided that 4.00 was not a huge issue and she clearly did not know how to ask someone for the answer considering she had no anwer herself. As my friend and I went to find the theater for our movie we noticed that she charged us for Iron man 3 which had started 15 minutes prior to our purchase, and it was the wrong movie. So not only was she incompetent in finding out an answer, she was not competent in our purhcase of the correct movie. We returned to the front desk with the manager seeking the correct movie. I noticed there were two young blonde employees at this point. The newest employee was being asked the question of what are matinee times by a young couple arriving to the movie theater. Her response consisted of looking at the manager several times... the manager helping my friend and I, and then stating...\""they are in the afternoon.\"" I could not believe that an employee was not knowledgeable on what times a mantinee consisted of. So my friend and I went to sit down in the theater now having the purchase of the correct movie. The seats were moderately comfortable and I felt as though I was in a conference center preparing for a powerpoint presentation. The staff was loud during the entire movie taking orders from the other patrons which was distracting. The menu we received to order from stated that Tuesdays were ladies nights and ladies could receive 5.00 movies all day and night long. We had paid 7.00 per ticket and not offered the ladies night price. At the end of the movie my friend and I exited the theater at which point I noticed a different manager from who had helped us previously. I went up to him and asked him why we were not honored the ladies night price and he said that we could not be honored that with a groupon. I said that my groupon had expired and it stated that it was a 10.00 gift certificate to the theater...so why not just offer the guests the 5.00 price? He said no and I said well thank you, over four dollars I will not be returning to your theater and I plan on writing a review. His response consisted of an \""ok.\"" As many times as I've seen groupon offering deals to this theater it is CLEAR they need more patrons and are not making enough money. Maybe they need to consider a change in employees, consider training employees on competencies and managers on satisfying patrons over FOUR DOLLARS. Had my friend and I received the slightest amount of good customer service and compassion we would probably return to the theater but due to the lack of customer service and employee knowledge you couldn't pay me to return to this theater. I would highly recomment amc cinema suites for they have a more knowledgeable and helpful staff and way more comfortable seating. I do not see Studio Movie Grill maintaining their business much longer and that projection is also based on how often they have to offer groupon prices to just get patrons to come see a movie."
3,"We weren't too impressed with the casual dining scene in Phoenix until we found this place! Located near the Heard Museum, it was easy to get to and the perfect atmosphere for lunch (kinda dark, but that's okay). The food was mega tasty and they had a ton of vegetarian options. \n\nThe only complaint I have is that the waiter didn't keep his personal comments to himself. ie: when i ordered something he said \""well that doesn't surprise me.\""  not cool and i let him know it, maybe he was just having a bad day.\n\nbut over all, aside from our lame waiter, good experience and good food =]"
1,"Meh. A little on the greasy side. Went for breakfast and the portions were ginormous. The food was decent, on par with Denny's or Coco's, aside of the huge portions. I'm a fan of the large coffee mugs though."
4,Such a beautiful and serene place the moment you walk in. The decor is beautiful as well as the unique photographs displayed on the walls throughout the spa. I came in for a much needed massage and it was honestly the best massage I have ever had. I have had a couple professional massages before and they always applied too much pressure and never asked if I wanted more or less pressure. Kristina made sure I was comfortable and would check in every once in a while to make sure the amount of pressure was what I wanted. I felt so relaxed after I left and the constant pain in my lower back feels alleviated. I will definitely be back! Especially with the great prices they offer. May have to try one of their facials next. :)
3,I stopped in here with the owner's girlfriend after she cut my hair. She kindly treated me to anything I wanted to eat and drink. wooo hoo! I ordered a Grey Goose and cranberry and a Las Vegas roll (my all time favorite sushi- even if it is fried). Both were delicious. Thank you!!
0,"Wow, dude was stoned or something.  I was looking for a bike and asked \""how would X compare to X?\""  Answer: \""It's black, it's legit, too legit to quit.\""  I'm not joking.  So maybe this is the greatest shop in the city but I didn't stick around to find out.  It was a very uncomfortable experience."
0,Do not shop at this location.  My wife and I went in last Saturday made our purchase and set up delivery for today. I just called the store to find out that not only are our goods not coming today our delivery was rescheduled to next Saturday without any notice.  I will be canceling my order and never shopping here again.
2,"We ate at the bar. My steak was cooked exactly medium rare but over seasoned. It had so much pepper on it that it made me cough...and I love spicy food. I was with a party of 5 but they only brought one loaf of bread; we had to ask for more. The bartender was friendly, but our server was an apparition."
3,"I felt like I was on vacation when I went here. Lots of music, great interior design, and a very friendly staff. Our server was really cool...we were treated like VIPs. The owner greeted us and made sure that we had a good experience. \n\nWe ordered the seafood paella and it was DELICIOUS and flavorful! It was enough for 4! The drinks were tasty too (we had some Cuban macha tea). \n\nGreat location in Plaza Midwood with ample parking. It won't break the bank and you get quality food and experience. Sandwiches are in the $8 range, more complex dishes are slightly more. \n\nI will be back!"
4,"Loved the food. We had the chicken fried rice ,lo mein, and egg rolls. Everything was tasty and the staff was friendly."
1,"So so burger,good service. I was not impressed w food."
3,The buffet is well worth the price!  My kids had a great time picking out which freshly scooped icecream they wanted after their meal and the choices were endless there!  Great staff too!
3,"We are not used to shopping at a Frys. We come from Alaska were there are Fred Meyers, Carrs/Safeway, Walgreens, and Walmart where things are expensive. \n\nThe employees at the register were extremely nice both we have been here so far. They don't offer much as for as beauty and health goes but the food was cheap (comparable: bag of chips for $1.99 in AK it's $4.99). And there is liquor, beer and wine inside the store! Not in another building like in Alaska. It's definately makes things easier.\n\nYeah for Frys!"
0,"1 star may be too much. \nI'm going to keep this short and to the facts...9 min til waiter addresses us. 17 min to get lemon for ice water...had to ask twice. 30 min, 30 to get appetizer of hush puppies. 30 min. Really?? \n\nNo plates for app, no silverware. Had to get up and ask host for them. Ordered fish and shrimp and a crab daddy. \n\nCrabs were RIDICULOUSLY hard to crack..they were so soft you had to peel it. It was not fresh at all. \n\nFish was suppose to be crisp and beer battered. It was mush. And the shrimp...no flavor. I killed the cocktail and tarter sauces and asked for more to choke it down. \n\nIt was a sun night around 8:45 pm with hardly any tables...service sucked. Food sucked. Was looking forward to a great seafood meal even though it's Nevada but ugh this was soooo disappointing."
3,"We were going to a Cirque du Soleil show and came across BLT Burger. The service was a bit slow, but the burger and milkshake were great! I had a Tex Mex burger with a vanilla/Oreo milkshake. Highly recommend both! I would definitely go back!"
3,"Was in conference at the Phoenix Convention Center and a glorious smell wafted through from the east. Turning to my left I saw a plate, and lady tearing something up..fiercely . Me and three other people immediately stopped what we were doing and walked somewhat zombie like to where the food was and asked...where did you get that? Karim's Cobbler Shop and Deli was her reply...in between bites.  \n\nNow I've been in Phoenix for 3 months looking for a taste of soul food. And here it was in my back yard! I was shocked!!!\n\nWith a sense of urgency I walked the streets until once again I was seduced by the smell of fried fish. Wasnt very far, and it was perched right in front of the Light Rail.  My kind of place.\n\nFirst thought, very humble. Very clean and neat and humble.  The owner was very kind, friendly and humble. Very confident that whatever I ordered I would love it. And I did.\n\nAs the only customer in the place I had soo many questions..How long were you here. Where do you market you store, cuz I never heard of it. With a smile he explained that his customers usually come in thru word of mouth and via the smell.\n\nI ordered the 3 piece whiting (its a east coast thing) It was well seasoned yet  non-greasy and well I wanted more of it. A side of red rice and beans which was flavorful and simply not enough.  Not usually a peach cobbler fan but it had so many intricate flavors. I sensed some clove, cinnamon, brown sugar...and something I can't quite put my finger on. The detective will be back to figure out this mystery.  It was sooo GOOOD!\n\n\nHearing so many complaints that Phoenix has alot of sun but no soul I can confidently say that there is however scatter amongst the desert.  One just have to put in the detective work. Use the senses...it will lead you there. But if you can't follow my lead.  Karim's Cobbler shop is the place to get your grub on.  Bring your families and friends too.  Everyone will leave happy. Or with an extra side :)"
1,"We were looking for good Italian food and decided to try this place based on the reviews. The place was surprisingly packed for a rainy evening so we decided to wait the 20 minutes for a table. We ordered drinks while we waited and were a little disappointed that an $8 glass of wine was not filled at least half way. We were walked to a table that the hostess warned us was wet and we had to ask for it to be dried. Once we were seated and ordered, our very small salads came quickly but we had no silverware or napkins. Eventually we were able to let our server know and she fixed the problem.\n\nThe live music was fun but, a bit loud. This is definitely a family friendly environment as children were running between the tables going outside to play and marching back in between the tables while we were attempting to eat. This seemed to be the norm with the staff and the patrons. I have never seen such a thing.\n\nThe food was alright, it really was in dire need of some serious seasoning. My spaghetti tasted like pasta with tomato sauce and the chicken parmesan tasted like it came from the freezer. His small portion of chicken marsala was thin over some broccoli. The cannoli  had a strange flavor and the nuts on it made our mouths dry, not good. \n\nOverall it was an alright experience, no where near all the great reviews it received. I don't know that we will be back.  Not a date night type of place."
1,"I visited this branch to get a new phone for a friend, and the staff were not as attentive as they could be. Yes, they did show us the handset me and my friend were looking for, gave us time to review it, but didn't keep an eye for being available again: in an empty shop all the staff chatting and literally I had to walk in front of them to get noticed. \n\nLater on when we decided to buy the headset, instead of thinking the customer's benefit and giving the PAYG card to the buyer with the \u00a310 credit (for a guest visiting from abroad, for example), instead the choice the representative used was to give the phone without the extra card since an existing O2 card would be used. Doesn't seem fair to me at all! \n\nAnd the switch from normal SIM card to a micro failed!!! And we had to do it again, but not on the same shop, of course."
2,"This McDonald's is conveniently nearby the Pepsi Center.\n\nIt opens late, and was perfect for the post-clubbing crowd I was with.\n\nA friend bought me a McChicken sandwich (not sure why, but I appreciated it), which I made short work of - it tasted normal, as expected."
2,"Dear Kohl's,\nI love you, I really do.  I'm brand-loyal to you since we were both born and raised in the glorious suburbs of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, However, my affection for you dwindled just a wee bit a few days ago after an unfavorable experience. (sniff!) \n\nYou got me with the $15 Kohl's Cash along with the 20% off coupon during your lovely annual Thanksgiving sale.  Man, I went to town purchasing kitchen, bathroom, and small electronic necessities on Kohls.com.  After my shopping binge was said and done, I had earned a whopping $135 in Kohl's Cash.  Score!  .....Then I went to town again purchasing a cookie sheet and luxury bed sheets for my condo.  \n\nEverything was fine and dandy as my shipments came in batches (some much earlier than expected--woohoo!) I made an error when purchasing the cookie sheet and bed sheets online and needed to return them.  Here's where the heartache came:  because $45 in Kohl's Cash was used to purchase these items, I got almost NOTHING in return for them!  \n\n----------------------\n\nThe moral of this story is that Kohl's Cash is a use-it-or-lose-it situation.  Be VERY certain you are going to keep the items you purchase with Kohl's Cash or else you are left with nothing.  Lessoned learned......I'll be back."
2,"Near Chef Rubber they have the large-scale equipment and smaller wares you would need in order to open a food business. They have a lot of dishes, tools, pans for a cheaper price if its what you need."
2,"Came here for lunch on a thursday afternoon with some friends. Randomly came across this location upon yelp to try new places. \n\nEasy to find location located right next to the Chevron gas station on the SE corner of Flamingo & Durango. \n\nGreeted and seated very fast. (though it was quite empty - one other customer at the restaurant. \n\nAfter we were served our waters, the waitress left and came back later to tell us the specials right before taking our order. (little out of order i think? don't people usually mention the specials when you get the menu?)\n\nI had gotten one of the specials for today. \n\nMixed Grill BBQ Pork Chop, Andouille Sausage, and a side of cole slaw and waffle cut sweet potato fries - $12.99 - i guess i was expecting it to be a bit bigger in portion size. Especially in comparison to the Chef C Teaser my friend got (refer to pictures). BBQ Pork Chop was grilled and glazed with a BBQ sauce. Size was relatively small. Maybe the size of my palm, maybe slightly smaller. Sausage was two pieces, fairly good, in size? together, maybe like 6\"" in length (lol . . . i know what some of you may be thinking . . . ! ! ) Flavor wise, both were pretty good. The pork chop was cooked well and was juicy. Sausage was a bit \""burnt\"" to a way were the casing was black but flavor was good. The cole slaw (wasnt a preference in terms of salad anyway) was ok. A little bitter, not sure what types of cabbage or w/e the chef was using. The waffle cut sweet potato fries were fresh and super crispy. Almost can say that was the best part of the dish. Lol which means probably wont get this again XD \n\nChicken Wings - (Mild/Medium/Chef's Special Hot Sauce) served with French Fries and Ranch/Bleu Cheese Dressing - $8.99- Decent portion for an appetizer. Variety of wings and drumsticks. The chicken wings were cooked perfectly. Juicy meat. Easy to eat and flavored well. \n\nChef \""C\"" Teaser - Chicken fingers, chicken wings, onion rings, pepper jack shots, mac & cheese bites, french fries, celery & carrots, ranch/bleu cheese) - $14.99 - despite the higher price for an appetizer, this dish is no joke ! SO MUCH FOOD ! Friend ordered this as a entree, could barely eat half even with some help from my other friend and I. The pepper jack shots were light, slightly spicy. Shaped like hush puppies. One of my favorite items on this plate. Wings were the same as the chicken wings listed above. Fries were thickly cut. In between normal fries and maybe steak fries. Best bang for the buck ! great for sharing or eating as an entree between two people ! \n\nOverall, good experience. Chef Carlos came out to greet us (which is surprising, you rarely ever see that much anymore). Great service."
0,The food was okay but not great; price is just like any other Chinese restaurants in that area but the waitress there was rude.\nThe plates and tea cup are dirty.\n\nI really cannot find a good reason to eat there!!!!
4,"Oustanding customer service.  Solid, courteous and efficient technicians.  And the most reasonable price in town!\n\nJust like most of the reviewers here, I called a good number of glass companies in the valley (including Kelly's) but went with my gut and chose Cut Rate Glass and was not disappointed at all.  I called on a Monday, the technicians came to measure later that afternoon and came back on a Wednesday to install the window.  Am a happy camper, not to mention I saved $170!  \n\nI have a couple more \""glass related\"" projects at home and Cut Rate will definitely be the company I will be going to!"
2,"minus a star for not having an EPL ticket to show all the games. for F###'s sake you are THE english bar in phoenix and I can't watch my beloved gunners unless they are on ch 167?? come on.  \nIf you are going to hang the flags and scarfs at least have the game, when its 7am and i want to get pissed watching arsenal-chelsea in the '5th' biggest city in the US and I cant, well, it doesn't make daddy happy. haha\nall in all not a bad place\ngreat beer selection\nnice decor, simply put, its one of those places where you get some drinks in for 2-3 hours, walk out and say \""holy sh!t, the sun is still out????\"""
3,"Walking through the food court at Westmount Square amoung all the standard food court places you see Sushi Bar Kim, a small restaurant with a sushi bar and seatting area. Your first thought may be \""I'm not about to risk it on a no name sushi place in a food court\"". Although I understand that logic you'd be completely wrong. Sushi Kim is a hidden gem, one if the best sushi restaurants in Montreal. \n\nThey have a good selection of standard sushi along with some very nice house specialties and all of the rolls at Sushi Kim are available with an option of rice paper instead of seaweed. \n\nOne thing to note is that one of their chefs recently left to start his own restaurant, Park, and I'm not yet certain if his departure has affected the quality of the food at Kim as I have not eaten there frequently since he left. This is the only reservation keeping me from giving them 5 stars."
0,Never got served. We were greeted by. Girl leaning up against the wall there was nobody at the hostess stand we were seated and nobody ever came to the table. It appeared we were the only one with this problem the table next to us had 12 people at their table and they mentioned to the manager that they had been waiting over 30 minutes and no one had ever stopped by their table. If I could give it zero stars I would. Will never be back. Too bad I couldn't review the food.
4,"Just about the rooms:\n\nWe stayed in the new tower, though I had never been to Caesars Palace it was by far the most beautiful room I've stayed in.  The layout was spacious, complete with a large bathroom, table and chairs, huge TV station - the room just felt sooo large.  The furnishings were amazing, chic, modern yet with that classical feel, clean, not too clustered and really tasteful.  It is by far the nicest room I've been in.  The bathroom was large, had tons of amenties, a great shower and tub and I really felt pampered just to be there.  The mini fridge was stocked with deluxe things as well, yet another perk.  Overall it was clean, amazing, comfy and made me feel really pampered!"
4,"This place is fantastic!  Every time I go I try something different.  The family who owns, cooks and serves at Da Vang are very attentive, give great advice on what to try and really work hard to make your experience a good one!  Love, Love Love!"
1,"If you like going to clubs, you will love this place. If you value good service, a friendly attitude, really good food, and a good value, go somewhere else.\n\nThis is a classic case of poor management. Both times I went there, we found tables available, but were told to wait 15-20 minutes.\n\nThe first time, I had a plane to catch. By the time I was seated, and they finally came over to take our order, I had to leave.\n\nThe second time, I gave them a chance. Long wait, and by the time one of the \""hip\"" waitresses came over, the ice in my soft drink had melted. \n\nThe burgers were decent, but honestly, there is a Japanese Burger truck that goes to various locations. It's a lot better, a lot more fun, and better priced. \n\nAs I said before, the crowd that goes here seems really \""in\"" and \""trendy\"", and act like they are sitting at VIP Tables in a Club.  The waitresses act like they are cocktail waitresses at a club. The management thinks they are really cool.\n\nIf they had a product that justified this arrogant attitude, fine. My wife thought they had great Sweet Potato Fries. That's about it."
0,One of the worse carne asada burritos I ever had.    I will never go back.   And the salsa?   You've got to be kidding me.    Did you get it from a can?
2,"Though the cuisine seemed pretty traditional Italian to me, I was suprised that Arpino had a modern, ladies-lunch decor and a fairly small dining room.\n\nAs with other reviewers, I was pleased with the attentive wait staff.  I certainly felt taken care of- at no point was I out of water or bread, and the waitress even arranged for a special menu request without charging me any extra, as I assumed would have happened.\n\nDespite my love for the atmosphere, the food didn't quite make the grade.  My zucchini rollatini was serviceable, the side salad a nice touch, but the bread that came as an appetizer tasted like it came fresh from a bag and the pesto that I had ordered as a side just tasted kind of sad.\n\nI wanted to like this place more, but it just wasn't happening for me."
1,"So I went back to Las Vegas Uniforms to return my purchases because I decided to be a sexy cheetah for Halloween instead of a sophisticated doctor (lol). When I initially made my purchases I specifically asked the clerk about their return policy just in case, and she said that I could return everything for a refund as long as the items were clean, unused/unworn with the tags still attached and the original receipt within 60 days... check! I went up to the counter and presented the items to the clerk for a refund (it was a different lady this time). She asked me what was wrong with the items so I told her there was nothing was wrong, I'd just decided not to wear them for Halloween. She barely let me finish my sentence before she said with a snotty attitude, \""we don't do refunds for Halloween.\"" Mind you their return policy is in bold letters on the receipt and at the front counter and NOWHERE does it state no refunds for Halloween purchases. Not only that but I had verbally asked the lady I checked out with before purchasing about their return policy and there was no mentioning of this. Besides, it's none of their business what I'm buying it for!? Either you accept returns or you don't.\n\nThe clerk talked over me several times trying to make a point. She was soo rude! So I simply repeated, \""I want a refund because that's not what the person I bought it with said.\"" She said she was gonna go to the back and talk to management. Meanwhile there was a small line forming behind me. I felt bad for being \""that customer\"" but in short, I ended up getting a refund. She tried to act nice at the end of the transaction. Please!!! One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. I've worked in hospitality for a while so I have high expectations for guest service. I wish I WOULD act the way this lady did! Of course this doesn't change the fact that their selection is great but their customer service is trash!!! Just like the yelpers before me stated..."
0,"This place is the worst. I was a customer for  2 years. & was always dissatisfied with things but was too lazy to look for a better salon until this week!  I've had enough of this place. Don't bother paying  extra money for a deluxe pedicure because you get a regular pedicure & they'll argue with you that you got the deluxe but you didn't. The deluxe is supposed to be a longer massage & my pedicure was done in 15 minutes which is not even the amount of time if a regular pedicure! I told them I paid extra for a deluxe & didn't get it & they argued back that I did. The owner does sloppy work on her fills too. They rush through their work so they can get back to their phones & laptops! They constantly take personal calls while working and they speak non stop Vietnamese to each other when customers are there. They burn insense in front if their Buddah statue that gives me a pounding headache. They've had a few nasty male guys working here as well that had bad chair side manner but have since been fired but still employ the man that ripped me off on a deluxe pedicure. They do not clean their tools well, have thick dust on the pictures on the walls and the male owner frequently sleeps in his chair in the back of the salon. Run to find another place and don't go here!"
3,"Panel change out. I checked with several contractors and the prices ranged from $3600 to $1300. EE was not the lowest bid (but almost). I liked they were licensed, bonded and insured and a member of the BBB. Changing a panel is not rocket science but they did it right, took about 3 hours, the rest of the day was spent waiting for the City of Phoenix to earn their \""permit fee\"" - at least when I pay my doctor $150 I get an appointment-and, of course SRP to re-energize the system.. A four hour job wound up being all day- not always the case, just be warned.  I had good communications with Tamira, they kept me up-to-date and even filed the permit for me at no extra charge. Even had Greg add a dedicated circuit while they were waiting around!"
3,It's pretty good. Tons of food choices and there wasn't a line for us. Loved the sugar free cheesecake. Definitely worthy!!
0,Horrible; don't waist your money. I left before they could even finish my order. Go to a different Chipotle.
2,"If you like olives, you have to get the fried olives stuffed with sausage!  I had the braised short rib and it was fabulous, hearty and fork tender.  Giving 3 stars because the prosciutto pizza was not that great.  Just needed to be cooked a little longer and not enough flavor."
4,Sunday night at Bank nightclub was amazing!   I really enjoyed myself.  When walking in the door man greeted us like we were VIPs.   When getting to out table we were greeted again by a beautiful cocktail waitress.  She took great care of me and my guests.   The music was awesome!  I would definitely go back!
1,"i wish I could rate this place with more stars but sad to say I can't. I take all my cars here, have been a lifetime customer since I turned 16. But today when I brought in 1 tire to get replaced, i was not treated the way I normaly am. I have always price matched with tire rack or their discount tire direct website to try to save maybe ten bucks, but ryan would just add on random prices such installation, shipping prices bla bla bla. \n\nAfter I priced the tire online through their regular discount tire website, total out the door was still 4.xx cheaper than what I paid. \n\nThis will be my last time visiting this place and am going to take all my other business to either there competitors....Costco, walmart, or maybe I will try another discount tire."
1,"Went last night with a party of six, 4 adults and 2 children. We live within minutes of California Crab, and were happy to try this place out. Unfortunately, our family will make the drive to HnJ Crawfish for any future Cajun seafood needs. \n\nWe were greeted and seated quickly as they pushed two tables together to accommodate our party. (Although there is no mention of it on the menu, or anywhere else for that matter, a party of six adds an automatic 18% ). \n\nAfter being seated, we were offered menus and drinks. After the drinks were delivered, we attempted to order. While not a terribly complex order, our server had an abnormally difficult time taking our order and read back the order with several errors. After attempts to correct, we decided to just go with what he wrote and left it in fate's hands. \n\nThe food arrived about twenty minutes later in bags of tasty sauce, similar to other local Cajun style seafood places. We had a pound each of crawfish, snow crab, two pounds of shrimp, and three pounds of king crab:\n\nThe good: the sauces and the crab. \n\nThe bad: crawfish and shrimp that were extremely difficult to extract from their shell and had a mushy grainy consistency on the palate. The crawfish were the worst I have ever experienced. Drink service for alcohol was extremely slow (he forgot to bring them, in an almost-empty restaurant) and didn't deliver our $2 side of bread until we were ready to leave. As the server was clearing our table, I asked if the seafood was frozen. He stammered for a moment, saying everything was ..., and lost control of a bag spilling the spicy butter sauce all over the table and on to my wife's Christmas Coach purse. He never finished his sentence on the freshness of the seafood. \n\nAt payment time, this level of service is usually met with a tip reflecting our pleasure/displeasure with the staff. Not so in this case, as we had 18% tacked on automatically. \n\nThere is definite potential here, but the lack of fresh seafood combined with inept serve will likely a doom any chances at continued success. I can't fathom anyone returning, and can positively say that we will not."
4,"Service was great.  Chicken Parm.  was huge.  Great bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, yummy.  Wife had chicken fettuccine alfredo.  She was very happy with it. Good grilled chicken and the sauce was really fresh, clearly house made.  Good Caesar salads too.  Didn't have any wine.  Server advised that they have half price bottles of wine on Thursdays.  Might come back for that.  Kids liked there pasta and pizza too.  Pizza was really good sized.  Good fresh brewed iced tea too.  No complaints."
0,"The restaurant was half full on a Saturday evening. There was Ennio alone in the kitchen and 1 waitress who had her hands full with only 20 customers in the restaurant. She would only appear and disappear once in a blue moon.\n\nWe waited 2 hours for our lukewarm meal. I don't understand why a plate of pasta and a green salad could take 2 hours to arrive and be lukewarm.The food tasted good but was traditional, not italian traditional but more like 1970 traditional. But we expected that.\n\nWe didn't expect my water glass to be chipped all over the rim, the water pitcher left on our table was dirty with fingerprints all around it like it hadn't been washed that day, the tablecloth was filthy from a few days ago, and the doily table runner contained an impressive collection of hidden breadcrumbs from several days back.\n\nWhen it was time to pay, and the waitress had disappeared, Ennio asked me if everything was okay. When I decided to say \""well, no\""  and politely explain why, starting with the fact that the food tasted good,  he clutched onto my Visa card and started arguing that my expectations were too high and that he was not running a 5-star restaurant, as if I didn't know that before walking through the door. I already expected the traditional food and the cheesy decor, the photos are on the internet. It can't be that difficult  to get hot pasta on a clean table.\n\nWhen I finally got my Visa card back, I smiled and told Ennio not to ask for our opinion if he didn't want it. As we were walking out, Ennio swore loudly at us. It was humiliating. The whole place heard. Terrible evening!"
0,"Our party ended up staying at Paris in Vegas over July 4th...it was a fun, nice place (great pool).  However, we all noticed bite marks on our legs and extremities.  We notified the front desk, to which they did nothing. \n\nAt checkout, we again complained, and they sent their house EMT up to our room to check it out.  No word on whatever happened on this... As I was leaving the hotel, I told a dealer about the incident, and he said on the local TV news that he saw  a story titled \""Vegas infested with Bed Bugs\"".  Great.  These critters can get in your luggage and come home with you...and infest your HOUSE!  Ugh. \n\nUpon an email to the hotel manager, they assured me that it was 'detergent' (ummm, I get bite marks/scabs from detergent?  Wow).  I mentioned the TV news story, to which they had nothing to say, other than to deny any bed bugs whatsoever.  \n\nThus, I won't be staying at Paris anytime soon...."
4,"If you want to have your phone fix (cracked screen, water damage etc..) this is the place you want to go for all you phone issues. Great and friendly staff that can fix your phone in a short period of time and at a low price compared to their competitors. They also have many accessories if you would like to pimp out your phone or just want to protect your valued phone."
2,"Its really the first magic show I have experienced in this scale.  The show tickets were like $20 bucks so there was not much to lose. There were some pretty cool tricks but it did feel sometimes like Dirk Arthur stood a little too long waiting for an applause.  Cheaply priced show, had a few tigers, made a helicopter appear. I went to the 4pm show and the theater was half empty.  It isnt very big to begin with.  Overall ok show.  If you are on a budget definitely go watch it, woull get your money's worth.  Next time I will go to Vegas I will try Lance Burton's show or Rick Thomas though."
0,Delta sucks. They delayed our flights so we missed connecting flight and then mixed up our party (even though we booked together) to different flights. The lady then told us it was our responsibility to make sure we were on the same flight when we booked. We showed them original booking form and they told us  it doesn't matter because we were going to miss our next flight anyways. (Umm that's their fault). We were delayed total of 5 hours... To top it all off (I know it's not their fault)... We sat on runway for 2 hours. I will never fly with them again.
2,"I've been here once.  The food is good...i only have it 3 stars cause I had a decent experience, nothing bad, just average.  The portions are small, as is expected of a place like this.  I would come here again if I had some extra cash to spend, and if you want a \""nice\"" lunch.  The setting is really pretty, we sat on the patio underneath the \""faux\"" sky and it was nice cause there are a bunch of different restaurants all next to each other ...so it kind of had the \""your in another country\"" cafe feel.  My bro loves Mario Batali...so that's why we came here."
4,"This hotel doesn't have the glamour of other hotels on the strip if that's what you're looking for, but the dealers were very courteous and made great conversation as well"
0,"This was probably the worse experience I have ever had at a Pakistani/Indian restaurant. There was one person there running the front. He didn't speak English. We were lost for about an hour and I had to call him three or more times because I just did not understand a word he said. I only picked up 'food maxx' and went to two different ones until I found it.  Ordering was not any easier. We just werent able to communicate properly. The food wasn't bad but defiantly could have been better. There was no complementary chutney, tea or anything. we asked for some, it was brought to us and then when receiving the reciept we realized we were charged for literally everything. The guy even miscounted the tea and charged us more than we had. We had asked for some water. The guy told us to get it ourselves. My sister told him, he's the waiter, he's supposed to bring us water. He laughed and went inside and brought us water. The guy gave us a hard time with everything we asked for until we just got up and got it ourselves with things such as napkins. They even had items on their menu that they didn't have.It was just a bad experience all together. Definitely don't recommend it to anyone."
3,"fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner."
4,"Went here after finding it on yelp and it was everything people said. Cheap, Fast and friendly. Wish i could say the same about the DMV!, I Live in the far south anthem area but made the trip to this place. Id rather support a local business than those huge chains."
4,The food here is amazing. I have tried more then half of it and it's all great. The staff is fun and the customers new and old mike you feel at home. This is a great place to relax and have a blast.
3,"Best $6 burger around. Smash fries and fried pickles are excellent. Always friendly and fast service. Great place for a burger, fries, and a shake for just a few bucks more than In N Out!"
3,"Found this place on Yelp while vacationing in Vegas (yay Vegas!) I'm really glad we drove out of our way for this one because it's worth the 30 mins drive and some!  Our faves include the spicy Mexican roll, big island roll, fried oysters and the garlic tuna."
4,I have found my new go-to appliance service company. They came out the same day and fixed my Refrigerator in minutes all for the cost of the service call price of $55.
0,"I really didn't want to write this review but I'm so mad and no one is answering the phone. I've called three times and it just rings and rings. The first time I went to Kneaders on Ray, I ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich and thought it was great. I work in Ahwatukee and it was a quick grab through the drive through before heading back to Tempe where I live. I went back the next week for the same order through the drive through. When I got home, they had forgotten the bacon on my Turkey Bacon Avocado. I was bummed. I mean, the bacon is the best part! But I let bygones be bygones. I even went back today. Same order through the drive through. When I got home, I was starving, had the baby in the backseat crying, was struggling with my bags and was ready to eat my sandwich in peace. But they forgot the bacon AND the avocado. I am probably too upset about this. My husband thought I had gotten some terrible news--I was close to tears. I just wanted to call the manager and tell them that that they should tighten up protocol but they didn't answer which made me even more mad, so here I am, not wanting to be mad but fueling it all by writing this review. I guess the moral of the story is check your food when you go through the drive through--but I shouldn't have to peel through the layers, hunting for crucial, delicious parts of a sandwich that are IN THE TITLE OF THE SANDWICH. So I won't be back. I feel a little bit better now. But not much."
3,Great coffee and lunch spot central to the offices in Uptown.\n\nCoffee and drink options galore.\nPrepared breakfast yogurts and fruit cups for on-the-go.\nFresh heaping salads made to order.\nDelicious gourmet sandwiches made to order.\nHot soup options for lunch combos.\nObscenely decadent desserts made fresh morning. \nVariety of pre-packed snacks for the afternoon munchies.\n\nThey've got it all in this little market cafe. Fast and friendly service with only 1 or 2 people in line most times. Seating options inside and out. Prices are on the moderate to expensive side.
4,"I have this rule go here twice before you  review.\n\nI still like it. \n\nGrowing up in a german home, its all of 2 things, clean and full of food. This place has both 1 star. \nI assume the first time I met Oma. She was a sweet lady and we bonded over me ordering a lot of cabbage. Star 2.\nThrow in the tagsuppe of the day which that day was the Knopel.(sorry my spelling sucks). 3 stars. \nI also enjoyed my brat. 4 Stars.\n\nI leave and am satisfied. \n\nThe true test is when I bring in my ma. \n\nMa noticed that today was Dill pickle soup day, this pleases her immensely.  We get soup. It's delicious. 5 stars! \n\nHer Rouladen was perfect. Mine was a little pink but thats okay everything else was good and I will still keep it 5 stars because some people like that. \n\nI also like that its a atmosphere that is close to my home in comparison to  Zur Kate or even Haus'. This is more realistic , cheap and homey.\n\nAlas I am still looking for the doner kebab of my dreams.\n\n5 stars!"
3,"When it's free, everything seems that much better. We got in on one of the LMFAO nights and it was awesome. What a way to end your vegas trip. I like the unique feel of each room, especially the library where you're not bumping elbows to get a drink. I still prefer the layout of XS, but it's always cool to see the designers of these super clubs push the boundaries of creativity and above all else, giving people a great party atmosphere."
4,"Hands down! This is the best Yelp decision I have ever made. Ever since I yelped Sushi places in Las Vegas and came across this gem, it has been nothing but amazing! The staff is super friendly and recognizes you after have eaten there a couple handfuls of times. \n\nThe Happy Hour menu is small but everything is AMAZINGLY prices and I love the Sake choices! (Lychee Cold Sake is my favorite). \n\nMy boyfriend and I even came here for a Non-Happy Hour dinner and everything was delicious. The chef gave us some Cajun Albacore on the house and that blew my mind. The next visit, we are letting him take control on what we eat because it was that delicious! \n\nSoho, you have customers for life!"
0,so sorry I didn't consult Yelp first.  all reviews are spot on - including the beer listed on the menu that isn't available....  Service was pleasant I guess but the food just sucked.  Perhaps if you go for the all you can eat snow crab legs you'll be happy but I don't recommend the other stuff.  Even the rice wasn't cooked properly.
1,"Won't be going back.  Husband ordered a gin and tonic.  Had to send it back as it didn't taste good and he was told they don't have tonic so they make their own?!?!?  The vegetarian sushi rolls we ordered did not taste or look that fresh... the avocado was brown.  Ick!  Did enjoy the rolls with asparagus tempura but they ran out of asparagus so we couldn't order anymore.  Also, the interior really needs to be fixed up.  They place did not have a nice ambiance and a big piece of wood blocking the old window to outside.  I can't imagine this place will be in business for much longer."
3,"After sampling two great oysters and a really tasty Parmesan Tater Tot during the Yelp Elite event in the Side Car, Diane and I decided to repay the favor by having a full dinner in P.J. Clarke's main dining room.  It was an eye opener, because before this meal I didn't know that this establishment was a fine bastion of comfort food. \n\nWe opened with what turned out to be the only discordant note of the evening: Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail.  The Cocktail Sauce was great, but for only 4 large shrimps at over $18 for the dish, the shrimp had better be great, too!  And, unfortunately for us and the rating for this review, these crustaceans were only mediocre.  Although they looked fine enough, they were tough, hard, and had little flavor.  But the meal was far from over, and I still kept an open mind after our stumbling start.\n\nWhat a great recovery!  The excellent French Onion Soup Gratinee that I was served was sweet and delicious--maybe the best I've ever savored of hundreds I've tried from coast to coast and around the world, since this is one of my favorite dishes and I order it almost every time I see it on a restaurant menu.  Our server, Anthony, said that the onions are sweated separately before they are put in the soup, and the cheese is a combination of Gruyere and Swiss, with the top browned with Parmesan.  As a photo reveals, this soup was bursting with cheese on the edges of the crock, and visible bubbles on the cheese covering glistened as if heralding that something special would be found inside.  Carefully breaking through the cheese with a knife, hot broth, a well-melted crouton, and well-caramelized onions came to view.  The broth was hearty and melded well with the cheese that fell inside along with the soup's other ingredients.  Not a hint of bitterness was detected in the dish.  The white crock in which the soup was served was large but I would not have minded if its bottom had been endless.\n\nNext for me was a Chicken Pot Pie.  It arrived in a white elongated dish that was shaped much like a shark.  The doughy top of the pot pie was tanned and taut.  It wasn't smoking at all.  But I needn't have been concerned.  For, when I broke through the thin crust, the contents were piping hot and truly delicious: a generous amount of white chicken meat, potato chunks, and carrot and celery bits, all combined in a tasty and creamy White Sauce.\n\nAfter recent repeated disappointments in landing a medium-rare hamburger at different establishments in town, Diane was thrilled with her medium-rare Cadillac Burger, containing tasty bacon and a slice of American Cheese.  When the cheeseburger was cut in half, you could clearly see the redness across the middle of the 8-oz. burger, as another photo discloses.  I tasted the burger, and it was juicy and delicious even on a plain bun, which is the way my vegetable-hating wife likes her burgers.  And, even the accompanying French Fries tasted great!  Plus, there are always the Tater Tots available to opt for next time.\n\nWe finished with a delicious shared Bread Pudding a la Mode finished with a very nice La Creme Bourbon Sauce that a diner can pour out to his or her desire, and Cinnamon Ice Cream.  The ice cream was pretty scanty, and we got through it before the dish was half-finished.  So, I requested more.  It was quickly brought to the table without extra charge.\n\nService by Anthony and his assistant was excellent throughout the meal.  Extra ice was even provided in an extra glass without request to refresh my Iced Tea.  Great comfort food at a high but fair price for the quality of ingredients, and everything prepared and baked in house!  This was a five-star experience except for our appetizer, which brought the overall rating down a notch.  Next time, it's oysters for me!  For, after this experience, there will definitely be a \""next time\"" fairly soon."
4,"Was in Charlotte in March and Omg the cook out!!! Why oh why do we have nothing whatsoever like this in Miami??? 4 am - yummy pulled pork, corn dog, hush puppies, cole slaw and the best damn banana shake I've ever had in my entire life for like 6 or 7 bucks. Coming from the land of batidos and where bananas actually grow, I'm tempted to look up franchising information but apparently this little chain does not stray far from it's queen city. Win. All around."
0,"Club Tempo has started a new weekly event called Jazzy Sundays. Doors open at 8pm where they have complimentary stepping classes. Afterward ,they have a live band. The format is creative and allows for a bit of variety. However, unfortunately, as is the case with a few minority owned establishments, things are not what they first appear to be.  \n\nThe first negative: They sell alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages but no food. In my opinion, an establishment catering themselves to adults over the age of 30 should be able to provide more than simply alcoholic beverages; from an entertainment and safety standpoint. Tempo does bring out a selection of 4 hot food choices around 9:30, which they liberally term a buffet. Perhaps this is their attempt to compensate for their lack of a kitchen.  The food does not stick around long and lasts for about 30 minutes before it is eaten depending on the number of attendees that evening. \n\n2nd, in order to use a credit card one has to spend over $20. They have an ATM machine you can use that will gladly charge you a service fee if you don't carry cash around like most business professionals. \n\n3rd, the most important criteria I have when patronizing an establishment is the quality of their customer service. This is where Tempo severely under-shines.  They underwhelm in making sure their guests are comfortable. The use of polite terms like excuse me, i apologize, sir or what have you appears to be a foreign concept.  Tempo caters toward bothers and sisters and are owned by brothers. You would think they would provide equivalent or better hospitality than their caucasion/white counterparts? This is not the case. Tempo is one of those establishments were they feel they are doing you a favor, when in realty they are providing a service. Bad news travels much further than good news and Tempo's ownership would be best served by taking heed of this.\n\nIn summary, there are much better and friendly establishments to frequent than tempo."
2,"We have POGO passes and the aquarium is one of the included attractions that you can get access to twice in one calendar year on each pass. So we have been here twice now, and I was hoping the second visit would be better than the first, but here goes.\n\nSome of the pros about this aquarium are the variety of animals, tons of talks / shows with highly informed trainers and fun facts on the walls and plenty of signs to help you know what each thing is throughout the whole experience. Every show on the inside we have attended has had really nice staff members and they take the time to answer any questions and ensure you know everything you could want to know. The gift shop is well stocked with a number of things you can get for yourself or family if you are so inclined.  \n\nOn the flip side, it only takes about 30 minutes to walk through the whole thing, even with reading all the signs and information - may take a bit longer if you have little ones or watch several of the talks. The front staff both times we've been here has been not so friendly and on the second visit, ignored us completely until we walked up to the register base to try and get in. There was no picture person taking shots for the \""fun photos\"" at the beginning on either of our visits, but you are forced to wait in that area until the automatic doors open, which don't have a timer or a person manning them, so you just stand there and hope they open.  \n\nOverall: C+\nIf we didn't have POGO passes that included other area attractions I'd probably be upset at paying the regular full price to get in here...."
2,"I grew up in Las Vegas so I've been here a zillion times. The security lines can be long during peak travel times (Fri and Sun afternoons), there's a nice variety of food chains and random and expensive stores. I always pray I get to fly out of the A and B gates since it is waaaay less crowded and there's never a line for security. Since it's a big airport, it can take a long time to get from your car to checking in your luggage to your gate, so allow for some extra hiking time. \nOf course there's cheesy Las Vegas crap all over the place and slot machines, but that's what makes this place so... Vegas. The TSA clowns are usually pretty easy-going and apparently the taxi lines are realllly long. So save time ad hire a limo. It probably costs about the same. Also, free Wi-Fi!!"
2,"I am writing this review because of Salsa. Yes the pollo quesadilla is amazing. And the burro's are fantastic. There salsa though is out of this world; yes it is expensive, but for good reason. I use to be a regular here, kind of a creature of habit. My love for the spicy side of life was quenched here. There salsa is made with several exotic peppers that can only be found in Mexico. That is why it is over six dollars a pint. The rest of there food is amazing, but pay the extra and get your piece of salsa heaven!"
1,"Loui Anderson was funny. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I had a coupon when I stayed at the Plaza it was for free admission to the show, which I figured there was some kind of catch. When I went to get my ticket at the concerge desk. The lady told me there was a $5 box office charge and 2 drink min and the total would be $25, I asked here how much was a reg ticket to the show and she told me $89, which was a lie. So I get my 2 drink tickets, which should be valued at $10 a piece. I go to the bar and ask for a redbull vodka and he told me you could only get well drinks, really so my free drink is not even worth the $10, what a rip off."
4,"We had a terrific experience here with Dr. Soltero. \n\nWe were a bit nervous about taking our great big 12 year old Belgian Malinois to a vet's office - her entire life, she was seen by a recently-retired vet that made house calls. We looked on Yelp and saw that Saguaro was in our city and had great reviews, so we made an appointment since our dog's back legs seemed to be giving her trouble. \n\nThe place is very clean and most of the staff were friendly. We did not have to wait long to see Dr. Soltero, who was kind and soft spoken. His assistant was also great with our dog and friendly with us. He gave our dog a thorough exam and helped us to consider several possible causes of her leg pain and prospective treatments. He knew what each course of action would cost, and helps us to weigh our options. In the end we chose the conservative option of treating her first with an anti-inflammatory, and we saw some improvement almost right away. \n\nShe's since been back for a follow up appointment, which was also a quick one, and Dr. Soltero called himself and left us a message about the blood work results. \n\nOverall we were extremely pleased with our experience and will return when our pets need care."
2,"I started with the mozzarella salad, the cheese was very firm. I sent it back. Next up was a margarita with mushrooms. Although the pizzas at Parlor are decent, they are not really wood fired at all. Yes, there's wood in the oven, however if you look into the oven on the right side you will see that it is actually burning gas. True Neapolitan style wood fired pizza is cooked in the range of 800F using only wood.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Decent pizza, but no comparison to PB"
2,"Ok, I'm starting a new category called Hipster Hype. That's when a restaurant throws in a communal table, brings back old school classics like deviled eggs as an appetizer, and/or covers bacon in chocolate on their dessert menu. \n\nBeckett's Table does all three, so people are obviously going to lose their shit over it. \n\nLet me break it down for you. Beckett's is fine. The meal will be pleasing, but it's overpriced for the execution:\n\nThe wait time for one drink will make it really hard to get a buzz on. If money is going to be spent on dinner, then that money wants to get drunk. Okay, not drunk, lightly buzzed ... still be able to drive. (Bad Teacher anyone? Cameron Diaz? Nope? Just me?)\n\nThe Osso Buco is an Osso-bummer. No marrow in the bone, just a hollowed out disappointment. \n\nThe Prime Flat Iron steak is served with literally 3 leaves from a Brussels Sprout and about just as many small potato halves. You really need to love meat to get this, because it's all you're getting. Also, don't expect it to be medium rare. Two people ordered it this way at my table and neither one got it medium rare.\n\nThat's about as A-Ok as you can get, right? Hipster Hype, you can't fool me with your charming farmhouse inspired interior. \n\nEven my beloved Deviled Eggs were over-hyped. The only thing I felt was deserving of 5 stars was the service. The waiter was fantastic. Spot on.\n\nYou know, it may be complicated to give me a real life orgasm, but it ain't that hard to give me a food-gasm. Now that's just a fact."
3,"Love these places. I was at one before in Dallas years ago so it had been a while but it was as good as I remembered. Very good drinks, super salad bar but don't fill up on it too much! All the meats they bring were all very good. So were the fried plantains. Incredible service. Always there when you need them. Not there when you don't. Pricey but worth it for a special night out."
3,I love the food and it is usually excellent service. I always visit the downstairs cellar bar. It has a hip rustic feel and pretty good tunes on the ipod. One of my faves
3,Awesome Atmosphere and Awesome Beer.  Great building with plenty of outdoor seating.  Got the Fish n Chips and they did not dissapoint.
4,"This is an aquatic complex that is open year round since it is indoors.  Very, clean and well maintained.  When you walk in to the right is staff members who you pay to swim.  In the lobby there are tables and vending machines and there is a party room if you want to book a party with them.  There is a family entrance with lockers and a mens and women's restroom.  If you choose not to enter by the family you can enter through the women or the mens locker rooms (make sure you enter which sex you are - lol)  There are lockers in here with showers and an entrance to the pool area.  There is an olympic size pool and a smalled pool.  What I like about this place is if you need to get a life vests or floaties they have them available at no charge.  In the smaller pool which is around 4 feet is where they offer swimming lessons for the little ones using 1/2 the pool and the other 1/2 of the pool is for open swim.  Adults can swim laps in the olympic pool.  There are even more restrooms and showers near the smaller pool with bleachers so you can watch.  This is a very nice facility.  My daughter has taken 4 levels of swimming classes and we have been to open swim twice and we have enjoyed every minutue of it.  I am considering having her party here next year.  This facility is well run and is another wonderful thing that the City of Henderson has added to the community on top of the beautiful parks.  We love living in Henderson."
3,"I recently spend a grand old weekend in Vegas for my birthday with a few girlfriends. I was left in charge of finding and booking the place to stay..so I was feeling a little bit of pressure since I always talk about how much a read and review things... I finally choose THEhotel. It seemed to be the most upscale for not as steep of a price as the Bellaggio and Caesars. Having a suite is almost perfect so after weeks of reading reviews and asking people on Twitter, THEhotel it was. I stayed in \""THEsuite\"" and was very happy with the room and hotel. Ladies this is the perfect room to get if there are a few ladies staying together. I swore that the room was designed by a woman, there were just too many little things that we noticed and appreciated that we felt there was no way a man could have designed it. First off, the additional half bath is perfect and the double sinks and ample storage space in the bathroom make you feel very at home...at home in luxurious home that is. There was even separate closets where we both were able to unpack all our dresses and shoes and have our own space, very nicely done. The beds are very comfortable and the concierge is completely helpful in suggestions and helping with bookings or questions, I called them a million times and every time I was greeted and helped so well. I love the door bell on the rooms, call me silly but I just it made everything seem more at home. \n\nThere were a few things I noticed that frustrated me, but not too much to where I would not stay again. Upon check in there was no \""nonsmoking\"" rooms left even though I booked online and called to make sure the reservation said no smoking. The staff told us we could move the next day, but by then all my stuff was unpacked and I had bigger fish to fry. Second, after coming in a 6 or 7 like the usual in Vegas, I really really need coffee; I understand some people have money and don't pay attention to the prices but $6 for a cup of coffee in the room? I just couldn't do it. Coffee should always be free everywhere. Third, I wish there was a mini fridge in the room for personal use and not just holding the $15 drinks. \n\nOverall, I will probably always stay here. Great housekeeping and room service (the nachos have like 4 blocks of cheese on them watch out!) the rooms are amazing and we got lots of compliments on it from visitors. It being attached to Mandalay bay is great, so you can get the best of both worlds, a nice luxury hotel but you can also walk to gaming and bars in a flash. If you have a few extra bucks I would encourage the splurge for THEhotel."
2,"This location used to be one of my favorite comedy clubs in town (back when the LA Comedy Club called Palace Station home) but it has gone downhill the past few times I have come. The comedians are usually pretty unknown and it's usually a crapshoot on whether they'll actually be funny or not. \n\nOur last trip there was on Saturday for friend's birthday. The comedians were sub-par on this occasion unfortunately. \n\nOn many occasions there will be very good comedians and I am looking forward to a better-known comedian that will be there this week that we already have tickets for, but for the most part there is a 50/50 chance that you will laugh, which is pretty good considering you often get free or discounted tickets to this place if you are a local."
1,"Visited the brunch buffet. The cost was $26 per person and I can't help but think that there must be something better.  \n\nMy first impression was a sense of disappointment.  My first bite was of some sushi and it almost led to vomiting.  After taking a breather, I was able to manage to try some other things.  Nearly every item I tired was cold.  Had it been hotter, it all would have been decent.  The dessert was the only redeeming quality of this buffet.  \n\nI'm no Vegas Pro, but I'm guessing that one might be able to do better."
3,"All the staff are very friendly and upbeat . . . loud music pumping from the speakers . . . it's more of a party than anything. When there is a long line at the window, the staff run out to the cars beyond and take orders so when you get to the window, your drinks are ready. It's definitely an indulgement to get a specialty coffee as they are a little pricey (except for $3 happy-hour), but I allow myself one every couple of weeks. The loyalty card is great so you can earn stamps toward a free coffee of your choice. I absolutely prefer Dutch Brothers to Starbucks any day of the week!"
2,"En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral je ne suis pas un grand fan du palais des congr\u00e8s. L'endroit est tr\u00e8s grand mais n'a pas a assez de toilette. Depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es le festival de la bi\u00e8re est l\u00e0 et malgr\u00e9 le fait que ce n'est pas un changement mauvais en soi (du \u00e0 l'ampleur que le festival prend de plus en plus chaque ann\u00e9e) Le nombre de toilette est ridiculement bas! Dans le pass\u00e9 j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 de beau Salon dans le domaine de la restauration et je trouvais l'ensemble tr\u00e8s bien. C'est pas mauvais mais c'est desfois un peu mal organis\u00e9.

Un autre point n\u00e9gatif c'est que l'ann\u00e9e d'avant, la place \u00e9tait grande, mais vieille et semblait avoir besoin de r\u00e9novation. Donc d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 on \u00e9tait moins coin\u00e7\u00e9, de l'autre, l'endroit \u00e9tait moyen."
3,"Paint me with tasty grease* and marinara...\nI'm  f#cking A impressed!\n\nI strolled in the the first time the other day, the little joint was packed, I barely got a parking spot in back. It was around lunch time and as you can imagine between 2 Hippies and this place, it's tough to get in.\n\nAnyway I wasn't sure what to get so the nice folk behind the counter suggested I just try their lunch special.\nHis idea was a stellar one.\n\nThe special was two one topping slices and a can of soda for 4 bucks. That can't really be beat. The slices were huge, two slices basically equaled a quarter pie (felt like about 4 lbs!). Tasty fresh pepperoni, no shortage of mozzarella and good quality mozz I might add as well.\n\nThe little dinning room (and I mean micro) was seatless, all were taken except one 4 top with three suit and tie lawyers noshing at it. They eyed me/sized me with my giant slices and can of Mountain Dew and immediately invited me into their circle. There they offered me a piece of their fine sausage pie. Killer as well. Nice patrons (probably made friendly  by the fine flavorful pie!)\n\nThis is probably the best NYC style slices I have had west of the Mississippi. I shit ya not.\n\nI'll definitely be back and I hope to see you there.\nCiao!\n\n\n\n*pizza is suppose to be greasy!"
0,"I checked this place out after it has been open for a couple of weeks, apparently not long enough to work out any kinks considering we were the only people in there. \nWe went in to check out happy hour. They had a decent happy hour list. Small list of drinks and a list of appetizers for $5 a piece. I wanted a margarita (when in Rome) I figured since their drink menu had a frozen house margarita on happy hour it wouldn't be a problem to make the switch to a margarita rocks. Guess what?!! Margarita rocks is not on happy hour!!! What?!! Really? Besides children who drinks a frozen margarita? (sorry if I offended anyone) The bartender did make a pretty good margarita though. \nAfter reviewing the happy hour list of food, I asked to see a full menu. Needless to say, I was unimpressed with their menu! Awful, 90% of their menu was appetizers and salads, with a small amount of a la carte items in the bottom corner. Really? That's it? Food was bland, the salsa was ok, service was mediocre to bad. Can't imagine I will return for a retry unless it is still open next year. Feel bad for whomever dumped a lot of money into it's decor and location. Good luck papi chulo!!"
1,"If I ever wanted to feel like I was in a movie I'd rob a bank for the thrill or date a 15 year-old. \n\nEvery time I've made a connection here I've sprinted, shoved my way and slid feet first to the next gate (TERMINAL). Whether I'm on time, late or early. Rieffendiculous! Who the hell is in charge of coordinating the connections?\n\nI suspect someone is on Colored Time and it pisses me off. \n\nAlso, I 'd like to speak to the architect who designed this airport 'cause this cumulative time consumption is busting my balls. Thanks Shek S."
4,"I got the most delicious carrot cake from Barb's the other day for my friends birthday. It was such a hit! The best carrot cake I have ever had. I was not surprised though. Everything I have ever had there was yummy. They have the greatest cheese danishes, red velvet cup cakes and cookies! \n\nThey also took the extra time to write a message on the cake for me before I left."
1,"Would have been a 1 star but our waitress was super nice. Basically the worst rainforest cafe we've been to. Empty yet still took 20 mins to get seated. Mixed up all my kids orders. My food, ordered last by 15 mins, came out first yet our server said it was all sitting under the warming lights. \n\nSeriously...consider not coming here. You'll be disappointed."
2,"Place was clean and had a modern look. Ordered the tonkatsu ramen with pork.  The ramen came in a large bowl with all the fixins (bean sprouts, green onions, carrots, and spinach) which I really did not care for. The broth was flavorful, the pork was tasty and plentiful, and the noodles were very good. Overall, very satisfied as I was craving ramen.  I would definitely come back."
3,"Pro:  value, charm, quality, independent\n\nCon:  haven't found one yet....\n\nSleeper alert.  Great breakfast, well-priced served with a smile. Ditto for dinner. Simple, relatively healthy comfort food.   Good Euro feel to it but not overkill.  Nice change of pace from the generic chains.  \nWell worth a try for a quiet couples dinner or breakfast with the kids--they can draw, play hangman etc on the butcher paper table top.  Comp. rolls to start and dessert to finish with breakfast.  Nice touch."
0,Worst electric system. IPod hookups dont work and the speakers were blown. Butlers go through your shit and the lamps never turn off.
3,"I had the sausage pizza and thought it was great. I think the menu described it as a Chicago style pizza. Maybe the sausage is from Chicago, but this is not deep dish. Actually pretty thin. But I definitely liked it and would definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas. I was there too late for it, but they were advertising half off pizza during the late afternoon."
0,"Came here while a robbery was in progress.\n\nThe cops asked me why on earth I would have come here alone (at 9pm, no less)\n\nAvoid at all costs, unless you need more excitement in your life."
3,"Love this place. Just took down the shrimp rolls and some pho, always good no matter what time."
0,"Waited for an hour during lunch. They took my order, waited forever, and ended up having to leave without eating because I needed to get back to work."
4,I have had my car serviced here 3 times now. They have the best customer service and are not trying to sell you on services that you don't need or ask for. A+ service and the integrity of the company and employees that run the place are exceptional. It's hard to find a honest shop that's not going to rip you off. Quick speedy service. Thank you for being awesome! BIG O TIRES on rainbow. 3 thumbs up.
3,"I ate here back in December.  I love the pizza and salads here.  Absolutely delicious!!!  Try the one in Brooklyn, NY."
3,"I've been here only once and really enjoyed this place.  I shared the baby back ribs and rib stew with my friends.  We were all moaning anf groaning from the savory goodness.  This is really awesome comfort food.  Also, they have some of my favorite wines on their list.  Just what I need after a long day!"
2,"Excellent Margaritas, Food pretty good too! Lack Mexican Ambiance, like having a mexican meal at a CPK. Nice Patio, Id go back for the Margaritas for sure. Excellent Service and very nice."
4,After reading all the negative comments about their customer service I was apprehensive going in there this afternoon. But I've shopped at their London and Swiss stores and love the brand. I must admit all those fears came to naught. All the girls were very helpful. Especially the girl in the changing area. She helped me diligently for the almost 2 hrs I was there. All the staff were most helpful and prompt in checking for sizes. Great experience overall!
0,"This place sux a**!  This is based solely on the service, didn't stay long enough to try any food or beverages.  The staff is straight up rude which was the only low light to my recent stay in Vegas.  If you stay at the Monte Carlo, there are plenty of other bars and restaurants, so skip this one unless you feel like being annoyed.  The staff was not willing to accommodate simple requests and seemed more focused on harrassing us than providing good service or any service at all!"
2,"2.5 stars. I took out the 1/4 slab rib plate with mac and cheese and spicy Kansas City sauce for lunch (get take out, it appears no one actually eats here). The meat fell off the bone but was a little dry and needed something more - maybe salt? -, I guess why it is accompanied with the sauce to mask this. The mac and cheese was okay though you could tell it was pre-packaged. When I took it out of the container, the mac and cheese was a little cold and held its shape from the container. The sauce definitely made this meal good but if I can enjoy my BBQ without any sauce it is my preferred way (and add sauce to supplement the flavor). However the woman who was taking my order was incredibly sweet, loved to talk about her business, and was plentiful with sauce samples."
1,"I really want to like this place.  It's cute, has a full bar, and lovely people who work there.  I also went on a particularly memorable and wonderful date there which leaves me with warm and fuzzy feelings.  The food however, leaves me wishing I picked Cafe Du Jour instead every time.  Please let me tell you about the last four times I went to Gypsy:\n\n1) brunch on a weekend morning with friends.  They were out of most of the brunch dishes and my eggs were rubbery.  The worst was that when we ordered cappuccinos and lattes, they were out of milk, so they made them with HALF AND HALF.  As hideous as it sounds.\n\n2) Dinner with friends before a play.  I went safe and ordered a pasta with chicken and veggies.  It was a huge amount of pasta that was a bit oily and not flavorful.  Eh.  Mediocre.\n\n3) Weekday dinner with two friends.  I ordered the ribeye medium rare.  When the steak arrived it was grey and so well done I couldn't chew it easily.  I NEVER EVER send food back but I just had to this time.  The waiter was really apologetic and went into the back to solve the problem (for a good 20 minutes!) by this time my friends had mostly finished their food and I was going to just settle for eating the veggies and potatoes on the side and call it a day.  Then our waiter came back and said they couldn't make me another steak because that was the last steak in the house (yikes, kind of glad I didn't eat it - Anthony Bourdain's stories haunt me).  He did nicely offer to make me something else but by this time, it was pointless since my friends were done with dinner.  As a final blow they left the steak on the check and took forever to redo the check.\n\n4) (you went BACK? I hear you - but it was for a birthday party!) All I had was drinks and I had a simply wonderful time in a great atmosphere with fun people.  \n\nOverall, since I love food, I can't give this place a good rating but if you're looking to rent out a place with fun bohemian style for drinks it might be worth a try."
4,Really knows his stuff and is really reasonablly priced!  Without a doubt the best and most honest mechanic I've ever dealt with.
4,Cuban sandwich is soooo AWESOME.  Fresh pork loin and great ham comlimented by the spicy kosher pickles and pressed neatly but stuffed between two halves of a fresh roll!  I would do this one again for sure!!!
2,Frist couple times I went it was great. And now the last few times I have been going the service has been really poor. I had to get up and give my plates to the bus boy becuse they kept bringing food out and not clearing other plates.. And haveing to stop them after having an empty glass of water several times The server forgot my card at the cashier.  Food is great! but I dont think I will be frequenting this place as much.. I will drive farther and go to the sushi mon on silverado ranch.
1,"What the hell happened here?? The service is slow, food is mediocre, quality is slipping, dining area is dirty and decrepit... This used to be an inexpensive alternative to PF Changs.. Now it's a half step above Denny's. You're off your game BIG TIME."
3,Very good short rib tacos. Long wait for food though.
1,"The rooms are very so so and the hospitality was non existent, I will not be going back!,"
0,I had such a terrible experience!!! I asked for a gel manicure with an ombr\u00e9 glitter accent nail and the woman working just did a gel polish with  loose glitter on every nail and it was just a mess.\n\nShe didn't touch my cuticles and did a little filing after she painted. \n\nI was so disappointed that the next day I went somewhere else after paying $23 for a polish that I could've done myself.
3,"This place was hard to find in the dark after a 5 day drive from Texas.\n\nFirst off, what's up with Pittsburgh and ginger ale?  I've never heard of any place serving ginger ale in a cup, bottle or can in Texas, but here it seems to be everywhere!  Every place we stopped to eat and even a few bars recommended I try their ginger ale and it's really good!  So we all got that to drink.  \n\nTo start we tried the chili since it was posted on the wall as great chili.  A few friends told me \""don't get the chili, you're there for a sandwich.\""  They were right.  The chili wasn't good.  We don't put beans in chili here, and it should be thick, meaty, and able to eat through a spoon.  This stuff was weak, watery and full of beans and maybe some other vegetables.  Our chili would make people in Pittsburgh fall over dead.\n\nI got a double sweet and hot sausage sandwich, the wife had the Philly, and the kids had corned beef and a ham.  We had seen the hundreds of TV shows about this place and we were finally here to see if the mix of coleslaw, fries and meat was really as awesome as they say it is.   They were right.   The sandwiches didn't seem as big as they were on TV but they were freakin' awesome.  We all enjoyed these sandwiches more than any sandwich we had ever had before.   We had just had a long day of eating tons of bacon and bacon booze, so I didn't think any of us would be able to finish a big sandwich.  WE DID.  It was soooo good.  \n\nThe only bad part about coming to Pittsburgh and visiting Primanti Bros is that we had to go back home the next day!"
0,"BEWARE!!!\n\nI used Total Eclipse to have a window re-tinted because the tint had been on the car for 7 years and was peeling.\n\nThey did the work quickly, and within about 45 minutes I was out of there with a freshly tinted window on my Lexus.  They told me to wait at least 3 days before I rolled down the window.  To be safe, it was more than a week before I rolled down the window.\n\nAbout three weeks later I rolled the widow down and hear a crunching noise, and when I rolled it back up there was about a 4 square inch area that was peeled and folded up and would clearly get worse.\n\nI took it back in immediately and the guy at the counter recognized me immediately.  I told him I was just there and he said \""Ya the Lexus right?\"" so they clearly knew I had been there.  He had one of the managers come out and look at it.\n\nThe manager took a look and said it needed to be replaced and asked me for my receipt.  I looked around and couldn't find it but told him I was just there a few weeks ago and the guy at the counter remembered me.  He said that without a receipt he won't fix the window because I can't prove that I had the work done there!!\n\nSo I told him that the guy inside remembered me and that they had to have a copy of the receipt inside and he again said if I didn't have \""my copy\"" he wouldn't warranty the work.\n\nSo I drove away with a damaged window tint and the crappy job that they did will now have to be redone by someone else, who will hopefully stand by their work."
3,"Wow, I'm really surprised by the negative reviews. \n\nI'm not a \""car person\"" and I tend to be a bit of a \""slob\"" in my car. My dogs tend to shed all over the car also. Being far too lazy to attempt to clean the car myself I love Autobell's basic car wash. \n\nThe guys do a quick vacuum, send it through the auto wash and then do the detail work - windows, wipe down and generally for my dog hair riddled car- a 2nd vacuum. \n\nIt's not the equivalent of a real detail job but the results for the price are more than adequate and make me feel like I have a respectable car... at least for a few days!"
2,"Kind of a sports-bar atmosphere on a Tuesday night.  Pirates on TV, good beer and wing specials, and some really loud fans.  Great place to hang out and watch a game.  Food is average bar food though, priced okay.  Be sure to look at the specials when u come in so you aren't jacking up your bill unessessarily with your normal draft when you can get blue moons for a buck or two!"
3,"Primantis is the ideal Pittsburgh sandwich. Fries, coleslaw, provolone, whatever meat you'd like in between the famous mancinis bread. I love this location especially because of the hours. Living downtown it's hard to find places to eat late at night but the market Sqaure primantis is open till 12 o'clock 7 days a week. I've tried variations of the sandwich but my favorite so far is the pastrami. I went tonight and I'll be back again the near future."
2,"Parking SUCKS.\nEverything is over priced. \n\nIt took me 25 minutes to get a cup of coffee, and I wouldn't have minded the wait if someone had acknowledged my presence and given the polite \""I'll be with you as soon as possible\"" report. Clearly, that was too much to ask for.\n\nBut if you happen to go when it's not busy (i'm not sure when this is...) I'm fairly certain the ambiance would be delightful. It's an interesting concept. Also, the spaces are WAY too tight for the type of traffic they have in there.\n\nThe gelato on the South side of the building is really bland and boring. I'd rather eat store brand ice cream. Their Pizza is really awesome, though.\n\nGreat idea - mediocre execution."
2,"Food is OK. Environment is awesome. Service is off. As previous review mentioned, chashu bun is a must try. Fried apply pie is special. However, the waitress is not prompt, who won't come to check if water is needed for the entire dinner."
3,This place is open 24 hours and have an excellent fast food/pizza menu. Try out their philli cheese steak pizza. Chicken burger and chicken wings were decent too. Reasonably priced. If i had to choose i will stick to pizza though
1,"Went for lunch today with my parents. Waited only 15 minutes around 1:00 for a table outside. I've been only once before for drinks and was seated at exact same table, against the brick wall. I could hardly hear my parents. Between the extra loud music and bad acoustics, we had to yell to have a conversation. :(  mind you I'm a club person and love music, just not while I'm eating and trying to enjoy others company.\n\nI shared the pulled pork sandwich and kale salad, both awesome. But the sandwich was drowning in honey mustard sauce. The service was not the greatest and the waiter was not friendly at all. Only asked my dad how his burger was, which he said was good.\n\nThe food and drinks are really great. But not sure I'll be going again soon unless its off peak time and sit inside."
3,"I have stayed at several hotels on the strip over the last year or so, but this week was my first time at Caesar's. I really enjoyed it. The place is so huge that you really don't even have to leave (except it's Vegas, so you have to). There are a ton of shops, plenty of restaurants and the rooms are really nice.\n\nPro's:\nMy room had a single king sized bed, a large walk-in shower with bench, small couch and over-sized chair. All of the furniture was very comfortable. The pool area, forums, and casino floor is all very nicely done and modern.\n\nCon's:\nAccess to the gym is an extra $25/day. Wi-Fi is $14.99 per day. The mini-fridge has weight sensors, so if you move an item (without using it), you can get billed. Parking feels like it is a mile walk.\n\nNevertheless, I think Caesar's is a great spot. It's affordable, has nice rooms, and is right in the middle of the strip."
0,"bad bad bad never again th curtains too small for the window the ac not working tv had static no blankets on both beds wifi not working office said and the parking sucks had to share it with a wedding chapel so when we came back from the strip had to part down the street because of a big wedding we left the next day. im telling my family,friends and coworkers don't ever stay at super 8 motels"
2,"A friend of mine was raving about SS which set my expectations a bit high since he was industry folk but my experience was OK, sadly.  The space was cool in a japanimation type of way.  The temperature was a bit warm for a casino and music a bit blaring for my taste.  But what it really comes down to is the food, right?  The food was OK but not bad.  The Pork Belly was incredibly delicious but the Shrimp Tempura with truffle was soggy and didn't have the bite and crispy goodness a tempura typically has.  I just expected a bit more out of this brand name and really didn't do it for me.  I probably wouldn't go back.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that are worth betting on."
1,"Maybe I didn't order the right things, but the crispy buffalo wings were terrible. They were super small and over cooked... I guess that's why it's crispy? Also the fried pickles were so salty, it was good if you just had one. Then the sweet tea... I guess it was a south thing, but it was the most sugar filled drink and after a sip I asked for the unsweetened. \nMy husband ordered a burger with BBQ and tots. Burger was well done after he asked for it medium, but for me it was good. It came with fries when he asked for tots and 10 mins the tots came and they were over cooked. It tasted like a ball of grease. Disappointing to say the least."
1,I found the food to be a little on the greasy side. For whatever reason the skin of my chicken was coming off and it just was odd. For the price you could do better. Actually I've been to plenty of cheaper place with much better AUTHENTIC prepared Asian-Fusion.
3,"I heard a lot of rave reviews about this buffet, so I was super excited to try it. Came at around 3pm on a Sunday. No wait?! Score!\n\nThey have a ton of selections, and I was happy with most of the items I tried - poke, chowder, oysters, crab legs, truffle scalloped potatoes, etc.\n\nThe downside: I was disappointed by the prime rib. Whenever I go to a buffet, I look forward to crab legs and prime rib. This prime rib looked dull and sad, but I gave it a chance anyway. Although it was pretty tender, I only ate about half of it, since it was lacking the flavor I was looking for.\n\nDesserts were good. Can't go wrong with chocolate covered strawberries, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and mochi! I'm not a huge macaron fanatic, but they have some there for those who are obsessed. \n\nI'll probably find myself here again with family or friends, so hopefully next time the prime rib will be on point. Until then, I prefer the M buffet!"
3,"1pm...\n\nOk...had to edit my review. After visiting an official Verizon store, viewing the tablet we wanted and then finding out it was on backorder for at least two weeks we called Michael and took him up on his previous offer. An hour after we called, he had the tablet hand delivered to the store. That's impressive. Irene set up our account. She is very knowledgeable about the different phones available, as she was explaining different up-grade options available.  I still don't like the fake phones they have here, but in this instance we are very happy. The stars are for superior customer service. \n********************************\n10 am...\nNow I remember why I don't like the retailer stores. All of the phones on display were fake. You cannot try them out, you more or less have to guess how they will  work. There were no tablets on display, but Michael pulled out two for us to look at. Unfortunately, they were not what were looking for today. One was a Verizon brand , the other was an older model. Michael was very helpful, and said that he could have the model we were interested in delivered to the store in less than an hour. But you know how it is, people want to see things now."
2,"This location gets 2 Stars. The restaurant was NOISY, & had a low-class of people. We had to change tables because the one we got was obnoxiously noisy with loud children nearby. I wish parents would make their kids behave in public, plus it was 8:30 pm & little kids s/b in bed by then, at least  I was at that age. Anyway, we did get moved to a quieter table. The service & food was great, but I recommend the Scottsdale location over this location by far...."
2,"Decent food, slightly more expensive than their competitors, and more legit varieties on their menu.\n\nI'll give credit to Imperial Garden's decor as it is significantly more eye-pleasing than other Asian restaurants and the fact that they have a full bar. \n\nI give kudos to this place because they're the only Chinese restaurant in the area that offers peking duck, a true Chinese specialty. Their seafood selection is also pretty upstanding and are cooked well. I'm also a fan of their \""banquet\"" specials, which is for when you go in groups and they offer you a selection of X many dishes to share for a set price per person (this is available for lunch and dinner I believe, though I've never been here for lunch). \n\nAside from the aforementioned pros of Imperial Garden, the other dishes on their menu (if you order without doing the \""banquet\"") is average-tasting at best and overpriced."
1,"This was our first time ordering at the Aurelio's on Craig (we didn't know it was there so we'd been going to the one on Cheyenne). \n\nI'll give them 2 because the pizza was delivered quickly and it was hot, but the two thin crust pizzas we ordered were garbage. The crust was not that thin and the texture was awful. Both pizzas were very salty, especially the pepperoni (the other was tomato, spinach, mushroom). We also had a coupon for a free appetizer and got fried mushrooms. They were bland, not worth actually paying for. We will go back to the Aurelio's on Cheyenne. Their pizza is much better. \n\nMy husband's comment: \""Ouch-Elio's thas right cuz it hurt my pocket and then that nasty pizza hurt my mouth, it gave me bad breath and had people calling me yuk-mouth for a week. Ouch-Elio's should make dog food cuz my dogs loved their pizza....my dog chubby loved the pizza so much it had him licking his paws.\"""
4,"I don't even want people to know about this place because I'll have to wait longer, but wowzers, amazing flavors.  The sides (or three) are the real stars here.  The fried brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes were my favs.  The brisket was a little chewier than I'd like.  One of your sides can be these little dessert cups.  Delicious!"
1,"Just ok. Nothing worth the hype. Def not worth waiting in line. You're probably there to just experience it and call it a day! Super cute inside and staff was friendly. I will say I didn't try the sweets, only breakfast food. So maybe that was the issue."
2,Was surprised that the jerk fried rice was not as spicy like the first time I went here. The portions seemed smaller than before and barely filled the round foil container. The food was still tasty and satisfying. I recommend the black beans over the refried since they have more flavor. Service was good and prompt. The staff was friendly and helpful in making our choices. The order paper is a bit confusing and the staff is there to explain to the newbies but it still takes a couple of times of doing the paper before you get the hang of it.
4,"Just returned from a visit to Montreal and this was my favorite meal of the whole trip. Like the first reviewer, we dined out on the canopied patio. It was enchanting!\n\nWe had a lovely, leisurely meal...great wine, fantasic crab cake, wonderful pastas and desserts. The servers worked at a team (and were all nice looking young men!) and provided great service. \n\nWould definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Montreal and looking for an upscale Italian meal with great ambiance and service!"
4,"I have been back two more times since my first visit and have had excellent service and an excellent meal each time.  We always order the riserva steak, and we are always happy.  It seems like hit or miss with other reviewers here, but so far I can't speak highly enough of this place."
4,The girl Sarah at the Makeup Forever counter is fantastic!!! She knew what she was talking about and made my night!!! I looked fabulous! I am so coming back for every event. Love it
1,"Honestly wasn't the best ramen I've tried in Vegas. The gyozas (pot stickers) weren't as crispy and the broth was a little too oily for me. This is coming from a native Japanese girl so, yeah."
0,"Visited 5.27.2012 (@2:45pm)\n\nThis is only the second time that I have eaten at this location and my boyfriend and I had pretty terrible service.  When we walked and asked if we could sit outside the hostess handed us menus and told us to sit wherever.  So we did. We sat there for about 15 minutes.  A few waitresses smiled at us but no one asked if we had been helped. \n\nFinally, a waitress came over who didn't know the price differences between domestic or foreign beer - only new the specials.  Then she left to find out how much a Kiltlifter draft would be - $6 (kind of pricey) but my boyfriend ordered one anyways.  I ordered a bloody mary.  The drinks seemed to take a long time and the waitress explained that my bloody mary was what was holding things up. Truthfully it wasn't busy at all and the bartender should have had no problems pouring a draft beer and mixing vodka with bloody mary mix pretty quickly.  When the drinks came (brought by a different waitress) there were no garnishments for my drink.  I had to get up to get my own (no bloody mary bar either).  The food came, again from a different waitress, but we had no napkins or silverwear.  I stole one off of the table next to us and went in for another. When I asked the bartender - he told (rather rudely) a waitress to \""get her a place setting.\""  I was really appalled by the way he spoke to her.  We started eating and the original waitress stopped by to see how our meal was and the food was pretty good so we both said good.  \n\nWhen the bill came I was pretty disappointed that the waitress did not inform us that there would be an up-charge for sweet potato fries.  So his burger and my Caesar chicken wrap were $13 each. \n\nHaving been to many downtown restaurants where I have received great service I could not let this experience go by without saying something.  I regret not saying something at the time but the staff didn't seem to appreciate our patronage in the first place.  Go to Arrogant Butcher if it is open instead.\n\nS~"
2,Phoenix airport and the whoppers here are delicious!  Service without a smile sucks though.
4,"I would follow Tina anywhere. In fact, I did to her newly opened shop. It's very relaxing and clean with great massage pedi spa chairs. Seriously you won't find better nail talent in this city and she does your nails exactly how you want. I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done."
4,"Great location, fun staff, yummy drinks, and awesome food! I had a quesadilla with beans and rice and it was delicious!"
0,"Just left here and they're out of everything, how does Popeye's run out of chicken? thats like Subway running out of bread...find another location besides this one."
0,"Not sure what all the hype in prior reviews is about.  This is one of the dirtiest restaurants I've been in.  The food is routine at best.  The frying oil was old and made the Mongolian BBQ taste rancid.  This place has been reincarnated several times, and each time it gets dirtier and worse.  This is far from the best and closer to one of the worst."
4,"I absolutely LOVE this place!! I've been working downtown for 4 years now, and it is not easy to find healthy lunch options (especially ones that taste good & leave you satisfied). I usually end up stopping in at a place like DiBella's or Chipotle trying to pick something that won't leave me feeling guilty, but I usually fail, spending more and eating more than I want to. I was very excited to see this new salad place open up, and even more excited about how great it was after trying it!! \n\nIf you order a customized salad and skip out on the protein option (meats) and cheese option, you can leave paying about $6.50. As you add meat, cheese, or extras, you'll end up spending more. It can be pricey for salad, but they DO use very high quality & healthy ingredients (like kale & spinach, quinoa, goat cheese, cashews, free range chicken, edamame, blueberries, wild grilled salmon, etc etc). To save money, I like to add cashews or some other type of non-meat protein & pay less than $9. I am more than willing to pay this much for a salad when I know that I am getting the highest quality & healthiest ingredients. They give you a pretty good sized portion, and it is the only place I've found where the food is delicious, I feel satisfied for hours afterward, and I still feel great about what I've eaten!\n\nThis has quickly become my favorite lunch spot downtown. It can get very busy, but calms down late in the afternoon. It is also noteworthy to mention that the people who work here are extremely nice! After reading some of the older reviews here, it seems as if this place has come a long way. Every time I've been there it has been overstaffed, making the service pretty fast, but not so fast that I'm not getting what I ordered or receiving poorly made food.\n\nI can't say enough great things about this place & highly recommend it!"
1,"Bookmans is a neat, orderly store that has a ton of books - most of them are in pretty good condition.  It's a charming place where you could spend all day wandering through the aisles reading.  It's quiet, the staff are friendly, and there's a lot to see.\nHere's what I hate about Bookmans:  I'll bring dozens of books and magazines in only to be told they want to buy only one or two items.  Then they offer 50 cents in cash or a 75 cent store credit.  No one gets rich selling to Bookmans.\nThe other problem I have is that they have a website, but their inventory isn't available to the public.  Every time I ask if they have a book, they tell me to call every few days because it can't be looked up.  What do they think this is - 1970?"
4,"Dr. Harter is an absolutely amazing and caring doctor.  He has been my OB since my daughter was born in 2009. I had an emergency c-section due to severe preeclampsia, after planning a VBAC. I was devastated by the turn of events, but Dr. Harter held my hand and told me he was very sorry but I was too sick to wait any longer, but I could definitely have a VBAC someday. Well, I decided to take him up on it. I had an amazing unmedicated VBA2C at Centennial Hills Hospital on 4/1/2014. I could not have asked for a better or more supportive OB. *Note*Due to his popularity, it can be hard to get in to see him, and wait times can be long because he's delivering babies...a lot! Those are small inconveniences to me, to get a good doctor!  :)"
2,"The food here is good and I like the decor but they over-season everything.\nFor example, my chicken liver mousse had apple slices and a spoonful of honeycomb and some sweet purplish sauce around it; when I took a bite of the liver without any of the accompaniments it already tasted sweet and nothing like liver.\nIf I wanted a cup of cream and sugar, I wouldn't have ordered coffee!"
2,"While at our stay in palace station, we decided to try the cheap eatery after midnight. We ordered the all-nighter skillet (2) and 1/4 classes  cheeseburger with fries (4) for 8.\n\n- Slow service. barely anyone was there and it took about 25min to cook a over-easy eggs and 1/4 burger patty. haha\n-Salty! fries so salty i was getting HTN.  \n- Skillet itself so oily. I swear it was almost a mirror now so greasy.\n- crispy hash browns. yum!\n- Not many drunks. :)\n- I don't think I come here for anything else. Only their all nighter deals 12am-6am\n- Must have boarding pass."
3,You can not beat the prices of Shady's.  They're so low I'm sure the it somehow correlates to their name.\n\nI think I need to readjust my definition of a dive bar.  I had heard this was little bit of a dive bar but I didn't see it.  It's very cozy and a great lounge bar.  I'll be going back again for sure.
1,"The fry bread is good, but it is overpriced and the service is Horrible!  The fact that they gave a Giant Tip jar is hilarious, since they just take your money and call out your name when it's ready.   I guess you're tipping for the indifferent service that is border line rude and obnoxious.  Won't be going back."
2,"First off, I don't eat donuts.\n\nThat said as a child I loved them.  Now I have children and they love them.  It is so fun for them to stand in front of the case and look at all the donuts before picking the one they want to buy and eat.\n\nThis location was very clean and the gentleman who waited on us was friendly.\n\nThe kids said they enjoyed the donuts as much as they do at Bosa donuts.\n\nI do miss the hot and ready ones from AZ Mills mall though."
4,"It's simple............. I don't believe I've given 5-stars to an Italian restaurant since Yelping, until now! I can only hope that if you're in Phoenix, and you try any of their locations, your meal will be as great as our's.\n\nAnd for us, the revelation of why this meal was sooo good, went back to the source; fresh ingredients. And how do we know that Tutti Santi cooks with fresh ingredients, like fresh picked basil from their own garden? Because Nina, the 80 year \""young\"" owner shared that, and a few other secrets with us, at our table.  \n\nIt might have been the comment that the gnocchi was absolutely as good as my wife's....... and THAT COMMENT was made in front of my wife! The word must've gone from our lips, to the server, to the kitchen......... to Nina herself! Because from then on, it was more than just a great Italian dinner experience. It was a great Italian dinner experience with \""Nina.\"" She left the kitchen, and came to our table, sharing some cooking, and life, experiences, and also sharing how she comes into the restaurant as early as 4am, just to make their fresh pastas..... and that great gnocchi. I couldn't believe her energy and spunk! Waiter........ I'm having whatever Nina's having for breakfast!!!\n\nAnd yes, we started by ordering their \""famous gnocchi appetizer.\"" You've got to order the gnocchi; either the appetizer or the entree! Enough said on that. We then followed with one of the specials; Penne pasta with chicken and Italian sausage in a pink sauce. It was DELICIOUS... and I could taste the very traditional Italian sausage, which was perfectly seasoned. And the chicken? It was white meat strips that had an incredibly fresh taste, and wonderful texture. Our other dish was their eggplant parm. And just how good was that? My wife commented that it melted in her mouth; the best version of eggplant parm she's ever had. And it came with a very generous serving of spaghetti pomadoro. The pomodoro is a basic red sauce, and in this case, a very \""Roma tomato\"" fresh tasting sauce. And because I asked about their meat sauces, the waiter brought me a soup bowl filled with the Bolognese sauce, which I liberally put on both their garlic bread and some of my penne pasta. That could've been a meal in itself. \n\nNina's kitchens prove the adage that, \""...there's no substitute for quality and freshness!\"" And she also proved that her affection for great food extends to her affection for her patrons, as she brought us a huge serving of her \""in-house\"" tiramisu. It was such a well balanced dessert; \""almost as sweet as Nina!\"" Enough said."
2,"Meh.\n\nThe +'s:\n+ Great outdoor sidewalk cafe with plenty of shade to kill that relentless heat\n+ Great people watching for those crossing Caesar's Palace\n+ Great for large groups but place can get crowded at peak times. Consider reservations.\n+ Plenty of brunch choices which is meal I sat for: chicken and waffles, steak strip sandwich, omelettes, french toast, pancakes bigger than your head and etc.\n+ French toast decent. Decadent and huge portions. \n+ Portions are great to be shared. Think massive caloric portions like Cheesecake Factory. Gross! Best to be shared than downed alone.\n+ Great home fries.\n\nThe -'s:\n- Portions are gargantuan! Hello server who served 12 girls. Did you not see we were all petite?? It would have been a better tip for you if you had just suggested that the portions were huge. None of us finished our meals and we can all eat but come on! The food portions were ridiculous and we could have shared. And no we did not know the portions were huge because more none of the patrons are from Vegas!!!!\n- We were asked to wait nearly 45 minutes until another server could arrive because our party was too large to serve! And this was after we had called for reservations in advance and were told that we would have no problem being seated at 10am. Get your story straight.\n- 10 oz. sirloin steak sandwich for $20. I saw mostly French baguette rather than steak. \n- Frozen hot chocolate. It's just hot chocolate that has sat in the freezer. Or hot chocolate over ice. Not memorable. Pass."
4,"Einfach, gut, unkompliziert.\n\n\n Car-Sharing in Karlsruhe ist weit verbreitet- immerhin gibt es Stadtmobil hier seit mehr als 10 Jahren, und das zu Recht.\n\n\n Wer nicht wei\u00df, wie Autoteilen funktioniert, sieht am besten auf den oben angegebenen Webseiten nach. \nIn K\u00fcrze: nicht jeder hat sein eigenes Auto, sondern die Gemeinschaft hat viele an verschiedenen Standpl\u00e4tze, und man benutzt eines, wenn man es braucht. Bezahlt wir neben einer geringen j\u00e4hrlichen Grundgeb\u00fchrt nach einer Mischung aus Kilometer- und Zeittarif (Treibstoff inbegriffen). \nSo wird viel gespart: Unterhalt, Parkpl\u00e4tze, Versicherung, Kosten durch Benzinpreisschwankungen.\n\n\n F\u00fcr mich am praktischsten ist immer, dass man Autos verschiedener Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und zu verschiedenen Zwecken buchen kann. Mal einen Transporter, ob f\u00fcr eine kleine Ausfahrt auch ein Cabrio. In jedem Auto (au\u00dfer Smart) befindet sich ein Kindersitz, weiter k\u00f6nnen im B\u00fcro gebucht werden - auch das ist also keine Ausrede.\n\n\n Im Raum Karlsruhe gibt es unz\u00e4hlige Standpl\u00e4tzen, an denen Autos abgeholt werden k\u00f6nnen. Und dies nicht nur in Ka, sondern auch in der Umgebung: Pl\u00e4tze Baden-Baden, Bruchsal, Eggenstein, Ettlingen, Gaggenau, Landkreis Rastatt, Pfinztal, Rheinstetten, Stutensee und Weingarten geh\u00f6ren zur gleichen Institution. Dar\u00fcber hianus gibt es Quernutzungsm\u00f6glichkeiten von Car-Sharing-Vereinigungen in anderne St\u00e4dten.\n\n\n Was ich hier nun noch einmal schildern will, ist die umkomplizierte Art der Karlsruher Stadtmobil: jedes meiner Anliegen wurde in den letzten Jahren schnell und zu meiner vollen Zufriedenheit gel\u00f6st. In Notf\u00e4llen (Geheimnummer vergessen und am Tresor stehend und \u00e4hnliche F\u00e4lle...) war immer sofort jemand zur Stelle - im B\u00fcro sind immer alle sehr nett und einfach kundenfreundlich.\n\n\n Fazit: \nCarSharing ist f\u00fcr mich die Ideale alternative zum \""Zweitwagen\"" f\u00fcr Familien und in Karlsruhe bei Stadtmobil ist man damit auch noch bestens aufgehoben."
3,"I'd pretty much agree with all the reviews below me here. Great facility, very cold at times, pricey to go to, bloody our of the way, but always a great visit.\n\nThere are various other things at the centre which aren't climbing, such as the ceramics childrens area, and the gym. I've not been to any of them but given how busy the car park can be whilst the arena is quiet means they must be pretty decent!"
2,"\""OvR\"" Rated\n****************\n\n\n\nAfter rolling out of bed at 2 PM during my Vegas weekend, I felt like getting a  greasy burger to counter my hangover.  I am always skeptical about hyped up burgers from famous chefs.  Quite honestly, I chose this place because it was easy walking distance.  We bypassed the line and sat at the counter.  \n\n\nThe decor and service were pretty good.  \nI ordered the  \""Hell's Kitchen burger,\"" one of their more popular burgers.  It was good, but just OK.   Truffle Parmesan fries were pretty good.  \n\nGood thing I came at the hour I did, because there was a sizable line forming.  \n\nOverall, I would not come back again.  If you are interested in a tasty burger without the waiting,   I actually recommend Holsteins at the Cosmopolitan.  Its a hidden gem.  Delicious"
0,"DO NOT ORDER FROM VITACOST!!!\n\nI have never wanted to give a place a negative star rating more than I do this company.\n\nI placed an order last Monday. After it had not been shipped by Friday afternoon, I sent an email inquiring about the expected ship date. I then got onto their live chat with a customer service representative who told me that the order had been invoiced and shipped, it just wasn't posted yet. Later, I found out that she had lied to me and that the order shipped that night, after I had inquired about it. I received an email citing the wrong order number that also included gross grammatical errors (i.e., subject-verb agreement, thanking me for my \""patients\"").\n\nI responded to complain that the live-chat representative had lied to me and also wanted to confirm that the correct order had been shipped because the representative who emailed me had cited a different order number. I also cited the unprofessionalism of the email. I received a response apologizing for the unprofessional grammatical errors in the \""precious\"" email. I received no apology for the lies, however, nor an incentive to try their services again.\n\nI received my order yesterday. It was missing four items and contained one wrong item. I sent a pretty angry and detailed email and posted a message on their Facebook page.\n\nI was contacted via phone today. I detailed the problem with the shipping, lying and now the missing/wrong items again. She said that the problem with shipping and being lied to had been taken care of internally. She was then ready to go. I had to ASK about the missing and wrong items. She asked what they were (which had already been detailed in my last email). She told me I would get a reimbursement to my account in 48-72 hours. Fine.\n\nA little while later, I get an email from a representative and a comment on my Facebook post, both saying that management had left me a message with their direct number to call and resolve the issue. WHAT?????? I just SPOKE with the representative and resolved the issue. They clearly have no clue what is happening in their own company!\n\nThe unprofessionalism and carelessness at Vitacost is unbelievable. I ordered from them to not just save on cost but also on time. The time I have had to put into this is greater than the time I would have spent just going to the store to get everything myself, which I now have to do anyway!"
3,"Meal: Drinks\n\nRationale: We'd had Dieu du Ciel! beer in Toronto, and had no idea it was a brewpub in Montreal. We knew we'd like the beer, so we gave it a shot between brunch and dinner (i.e. a sandwich and more drinks) on the last night we were in Montreal. This was another escape from torrential downpour. So it goes.\n\nFood: We got a tray of nachos to snack on (they were just like you might make in your toaster oven at home) but the real star of the show was obviously the beer. Dieu du Ciel! had something like 14 beers on tap. I wanted to try all of them, but I am a lightweight and did not want to die. I know I had the Corne du Diable (American IPA) and the Aphrodisiaque (black ale) - both exactly to my taste. I had one or two more after that but I've forgotten what they were.\n\nService/atmosphere: Very crowded, very loud. I think a lot of people were thinking the same as we were given the weather and that it was Saturday. We scouted what was probably the last table. Service was very attentive. Usually we were able to order our next round so it would arrive just before we finished our previous one. The people at a neighbouring table were annoying, but that's no fault of the establishment.\n\nConclusion: Great beer. Would happily return to try all of them, despite it being a bit crowded (i.e makes Matt anxious)."
2,"Personally, I didn't find the staff too friendly. The girl at the register didn't seem happy to be there. I ordered a 16\"" pizza with ham and bell peppers. The crust, which is somewhat New York style, was good but otherwise I didn't think the pizza was very tasty. My friend, on the other hand, did enjoy it."
2,"Meatball sandwiches - okay, don't care for the bread, wouldn't order again\nBroccoli cheese soup - yummy, wish I had gotten a bowl instead of cup\nOatmeal chocolate chip cookie - okay, not as sweet as I would like, won't order again\nCoffee milkshake - delicious, amazing, yummy, must have\nFresh brewed iced tea - yeah!  yum\n\nThis place was super busy on Friday at lunch time.  Many people coming over from convention center.  I highly recommend you call in your order.  Otherwise the line was out the door."
2,"I tried this facility out for a week using the 7 day pass. I've been a member of 24 HR Fitness in southern california and had high expectations as that gym was amazing. I was a bit disappointed in this facility. While it is nice in design, layout and cleanliness it lacked in other areas. Upon arriving I checked in to use my pass and the front desk didn't know much nor did they act professional. Yes they were friendly but knowledgeable, definitely not. At the end of my workout I had to seek out a membership rep who then gave me a proper tour and explained the pricing etc...\n\nFor me childcare at a gym is priority because I need it for my little ones. The childcare staff here is dull and not at all personable. My son normally loves going to the childcare because he gets to play with kids but from the moment we got there he was upset. After awhile I was told he settled down. I don't think its an unsafe environment just not a fun one for the kids. \n\nHowever, the one thing that this gym has is great instructors. I took a cardio kickboxing class with 2 different instructors and both were amazing!! I got a great workout. I only wish there were more classes offered. Compared to other gyms they really don't offer many classes which is unfortunate as the classes are what could possibly set this gym apart. \n\nOverall, it was an alright gym that was a competitive price and nice facility with some customer service downfalls. Not the worst one I've ever been to."
2,"I went here with the husband and his parents this morning to celebrate his dad's birthday. It was overall a pleasant place. The outside looks fairly modern and the inside looks like they put some effort into the decor. The service here was great, the waitress was friendly, helpful, and kept our drinks full the whole time. The food here was very inexpensive, with not many dishes over 6$. As expected, the food isn't anything special. I had the eggs benedict special and it was fine... not something I would run back for, but fine. The hollandaise didn't taste like it was freshly made (maybe the stuff from the jar... eek... maybe just a somewhat poorly made hollandaise... either way, not great). The benedict also had some spinach on it that they had absolutely cooked to death, but the eggs were cooked correctly. The potatoes on the side were very plain. The biscuits and gravy the husband had were also just ok. The coffee was good. Overall, for the price this place is fine, and if it were in my neighborhood, I would come here once in awhile, but it's nothing to go out of your way for."
4,"Dr. Khaydatov treated my family member and we were really happy with the results. He was very professional, attentive and pleasant to deal withl. We are definitely coming back to see him and the staff!"
4,"I read the Yelp review before I brought my family there.  However, unlike it mentioned in the reviews, this is a premium steakhouse located in a  5-star Marriott Resort next to its Pro golf Shop.  Most of its customers are business people and casual dressing is not recommended although it is not prohibited.  Main courses (steaks) are amazing and priced between $38 and $50.  Therefore, it shall be a $$$$ (over $60 pp) instead of $$$ restaurant.  You can choose the salt among 6 different styles of sea salt and 5 different kinds of steak source.  The menu is ala carte therefore, sharing side and appetizers are common.  The $17 appetizer \""tower of sea food\"" is well-worth its price, that includes half lobster, 2 oysters, 2 jumbo shrimps, 2 crab legs.  The steaks and seafood are perfect.  Unfortunately, Arizona law prohibits customer to bring their own wine, which is not accustomed by Californian like us.   The waitress and waiters service is 5-star.  After all, we had a great dinner with higher price that was not originally expected."
2,"Pretty big menu, and overall pretty decent breakfast...nothing crazy good here though, everything I have had is just ok. Egg works got them beat for sure! Or if you want some real solid breakfast go to the coffee cup!"
2,"Decided to yelp for a good breakfast place while I was chilling at vegas and came across this place. \n\nIt was a sunday morning about 10am and it was already super pack. It was about a 30 min wait. Which i thought for good food, should be worth the wait. \n\nFinally got in and everything look really good. All portions are huge! I end up ordering a original Benedict.\n\nI thought the food was good on presentation but the food was just okay for me. My order was kind of cold which I thought was a buzz kill. It wasn't even a little bit warm. I would think if it was nice and hot everything would have tastes great but I guess i would never know."
1,"So glad we purchased a groupon here to try it out. Upon arriving we waited 10 minutes at our table before asking a busser to see who our waitress was supposed to be. \n\nIt seemed 5 different people took care of us, which in some restaurants is called teamwork, here it was disarray. \n\nThe tables were so close in their side room that we felt like we were sharing conversations with people we didn't know. Also, our steaks, while cooked to order, lacked flavor.\n\nOn the good end, we loved the setting. The decorations and mood was nice. The fries were good, the seasonal beer was great (3 dollar draft at happy hour) and the baked potato was outstanding.\n\nWe probably won't be back, but it'd be worth trying if you find the right deal or like their menu options. My hope would be that our service experience was an outlier."
1,"Average. OK winelist, food basic Italian without much thought, ambience OK. Would I recommend it? Not if I could walk somewhere closer...."
2,The mac'n cheese was really lacking flavour. The Texas BBQ beans and brisket were excellent. The chicken a bit dry. And they dont give you enough sauce!!
4,"I love that Hulas made a second location because every time we head to Scottsdale/old town and we can't make our mind up on where to eat, we head to Hulas...\n\nI love their Mai-Tai's... \n\nAs some of you may know I am a huge fan of their \""Hangover Hash\""... Not because I'm hungover quite often but I love the ingredients... That luau pork over the crispy hash browns goes great with the 2 over medium eggs on top... That is my go to breakfast/brunch option...\n\nI have so many other favorites on the menu but I'm making myself hungry as I write this review so this one will be a short one...\n\nThe decor here is very cute and goes well in the Old Town area... Service is prompt and some days get busier than others... Great job Hula's #2..."
2,"Sushi was very good and fresh. The restaurant was very busy, probably due to the $0.25 draft beers on Monday night's. The sushi counter was kinda awkard with high panels."
3,"Nous y sommes all\u00e9s avec un couple d'amis qui a fait l'exp\u00e9rience Tapas 24 \u00e0 Barcelone.

4,"We were looking for an Italian restaurant for dinner and came across the Casanova. This place has a great menu with lots of choices! \n\nFor appetizers we got the calamari & shrimp. It comes with a lemon wedge and tartar sauce. It was okay. We also ordered the Cesar salad. I love Caesar salads with shaved parmesans and that's just what the salad had! \n\nFor dinner, I tried the fetticcini with meat sauce and my boss got the sea bass. \n\nPrices are reasonable, especially for Vegas dining. \n\nIf you write a review, you get a free dessert!"
2,"Its a great little bar, the bar staff are extremely knowledgeable about cocktails and can even mix you something not on the menu. The food is really good and very reasonable for the area.\n\nWhy did they have to build this place so close too the student accommodation? Fanny central."
3,"This course is a great value for locals. It has a challenging layout and great views. It is located in somewhat of a condo canyon, but none of the holes feel cramped. I play it about once every two weeks and the pro shop staff is helpful and pleasant. It is not as unique as some of the high-end courses in Vegas, but for the good deals that you can get, I'm not gonna complain."
3,"The Fountains of Bellagio. Something everyone visiting Vegas should have seen at least once.\nThe show takes about 10 minutes, is FREE and runs every half hour right out fron the Bellagio Casino.\nI like it best at night, along with the lights it's really beautiful, a nice stop while strolling the strip.\nGreat photo ops, not to be missed!"
3,Been going for 6 years  and great pizza just like my  previous home on Long Island. Service and atmosphere stink.
1,First time here and we had heard great things from friends about their breakfast. \n\nMy meal was pretty cold when it arrived and cold hash browns really don't do it for me! The poached eggs were perfect and the wholewheat toast was unusually good but to eat a meal that is half the right temperature and half cold is not great.\n\nService was very friendly and coffee refills came quickly and without asking which is always appreciated.\n\nUnfortunately breakfast joints are pretty much everywhere in Chandler so when you have such a choice an experience like this is not going to make me come back.
3,"PROS:\nIf you have been boycotting Starbucks for a long time, this is the place to escape to. \n\nThey have a coffee drink called 911. \n\nStaff is really cool and one informed me that they give proceeds to MDA. \n\nCONS: \nA small menu of coffee to choose from. \n\nNo shady area to sit. You have to drive thru and go find that shade elsewhere."
3,"4.5 stars.\n\nRight when we pulled up and parked you could smell the smoke.  We parked right in front of where they load the wood into their smokers.  It was a good sight to see.  Looked like we were in for some great BBQ.  We got in line and I was in awe of the big smokers they have behind the counter.  When you order your stuff, they pull it out of the smoker and cut it fresh for you and weigh it right in front of you on a scale.  They then place it on butcher paper and into a milk carton type tray.  I couldn't wait to try it!  We were in for some grub!  There was no line either (probably due to Easter) at almost noon which was a score!\n\n\nOne of my coworkers used to work at a Rudys in Texas many years ago and he recommended I get a few things....  Pork ribs, creamed corn and a loaded baked potato with meat.  We got that and a whole bunch more too ;-).  We got 1/4 pound lean brisket, 1/4 pound smoked turkey, 3 pork ribs, 3 baby back ribs, a half chicken, a loaded baked potato with brisket on top, some creamed corn and some drinks. They also give you slices of white/wheat bread for free so you can make sandwiches out of your meat.  Total came out to $35.00.\n\nHere is how the food stacked up..................\n\nPork Ribs- These things were fantastic.  They had a fantastic bark on them.  Almost looked burnt but they weren't.  They tasted great and had a strong pepper/smoke flavor to them.  I liked them a lot and my friend wasn't lying when he recommended them.  They were awesome!\n\nBaby Back Ribs-  These were great too.  Not as blackened as the pork ribs but still seasoned well.  The meat came off the bone with just a little tug.  Damn they were good!\n\nSmoked Turkey-  Delicious!  It had the perfect amount of smoke flavor but was still pretty moist and not dried out.  My best friend is a turkey lover (he ordered turkey every chance he could on our KC/Memphis trip a few years back).  He would have loved this stuff.  It was great!\n\nLean Brisket-  I'm usually not a big brisket fan but this stuff was legit.  You could see the straight up smoke ring around the edge of the meat.  It was tender and delicious.  I don't know if I have ever had better brisket.  I would definitely get it again.\n\nLoaded Baked Potato-  They give you a softball sized baked potato and top it with a ton of butter, cheese, sour cream (we skipped the sour cream) and your choice of meat.  We got brisket on it and unlike the slices of brisket they give you when you order brisket on its own, this stuff was almost like burnt ends chunked brisket.  Tasted great!\n\nHalf Chicken-  This is the only thing we didn't really like.  We picked at it a bit and it had a great smoked flavor but we were so full from everything else that we tossed most of it.  Wouldn't get it again.\n\nCreamed Corn-  This was just ok.  I like corn but usually when its corn on the cob.  Plain corn I will eat but I'm not the biggest fan.  This corn tasted like frozen corn you can buy and then they creamed it up.  Its almost like a gravy of sorts.  I probably would not get it again.  We tossed most of it.\n\nCoke products in the fountain drinks.  They had a grip of bottled drinks/beer in huge metal tubs of ice too.  It was cool to see.  My wife got a root beer in a bottle and liked it.\n\nService was friendly.  They did forget to give me my potato at first but then when we brought it to their attention they got on top of it right away and brought it out to our table.  Total of $35.00 for the giant crate of food we got was well worth it IMO.  \n\nThis was some of the best BBQ I have had in a long long time.  It reminded me of me and my buddies trip to KC and Memphis a few years back.  The smoked meats are delicious and I would come back often if I lived out here.  Don't even ask me how their BBQ sauce tasted.......I didn't try it.  The meat was so damn good it didn't need any.  That's a winner folks!  Legit Texas BBQ at its finest!"
4,"I absolutely almost died here choking on french toast, but the french toast is amazing, so I still come here. Their french toast is also special -- they use sourdough bread, light egg covering, and sprinkle powdered sugar on it. This is what french toast should actually be. Well it is what it should be in the Southwest United States according to wikipedia, but that's where I am from so take it! \n\nThey also have fresh orange juice, great prices, and very friendly service. Be careful to go on Sundays around 9-10 because there's a church up the street where nearly everyone attends Original after."

3,"I dig this place.\n\nPerfect location right in the middle of the strip. \nLeast amount of walking from your room to gambling.\nFriendly staff (always willing to help, quick and strong with the drinks, talkative dealers)\nClean rooms with flat screens.  \nCheap.\nFat Elvis.\n\nSure, it's no mega resort.  Sure the gambling floor is small and the restaurants aren't the best.  But, it's one of the hidden gems of the strip that will surely be gone in a few years.  \n\nEnjoy it while you can."
3,I love this place. When I first moved to Las Vegas it was one of the only places I knew of to get vegan food. Took my son back today and he went crazy for his chicken sandwich and banana slush. Still as great as I remember.
1,"I haven't posted in a while but my Fiance and I just had an interesting experience...\n\nWe ordered $44.00 worth of sushi for delivery from Sushi Hoshimi. \n\nThe sushi is fantastic and it's unfortunate that the delivery driver almost intruded into our apartment demanding more tip. He was extremely aggressive, put his foot in our door! He even threatened to call his boss. lol. Did he? No. My Fiance ended up closing the door on his face - he had no choice, I saw it. \n\nNever in our lives has this happened to us before. This driver was totally crazy. We've ordered for delivery 3 times and EACH time he was rude. \n\nAs I said, the sushi is great, but this made my jaw drop. We order from somewhere else now. \n\nThe sushi is good at Sushi Hoshimi, but not *that* good. :-S"
2,"The food was pretty good; although the meatballs were a little too drenched in soy sauce. I wish the bar was a little bigger. They only carried a couple of beers and I like variety...all in all, it was pretty good."
4,"The Center recently moved from a tiny, sort of run-down location to a brand-new, absolutely beautiful building. With the move, The Center is still providing their appreciated services to the community, and can now expand to offer even more.\n\nAt The Center, anyone can get STD testing for free, no matter your sexuality. The process is fast with short wait times, and everyone is incredibly professional and nice. They can even draw blood without hurting you or making you cry, as I'm afraid of needles - mega perk. It's hard to beat staying safe for zero cost out of pocket.\n\nOn the other side of things, The Center offers free computer use and internet access, and now has a growing library that people can use for free. They offer support meetings, throw fun fundraising events, and specifically make sure kids and teens have a private, \""just them\"" space to call their own. I also hear they have a bomb cafe for lunch.\n\nThe Center is doing great work for the Vegas community. Get tested!"
4,"When I lived nearby, I would eat here at least once a week.  You can't go wrong here.  The menu is centered on roasted chicken.   You can get it with Jaco sauce, black beans, whole chicken etc.  They have a large variety of sides that are just as good as the entrees.  It is a very fast-order at the counter type of place.  It is cheap, filling, and very tasty."
3,"Great Place to come in and have a cup of coffee while returning emails! I love the fact that i can come in early in the day and enjoy a delicious Vanilla Latte. Some complaints I do hope you take into consideration is getting better seats. Its not very comfortable to be sitting on metal chairs and would love to have some sort of lounge area to enjoy. I have also experienced a couple of times coming in the morning that the WiFi won't connect properly and there is nothing the Baristas can do about it. Its a huge disappointment when i get ready and come in just to find out i have to go back home to do my work. Mind you, i have heard people complain to the workers about WiFi plentiful times.\n\nOn a side note, the Baristas are very nice and welcoming. There is one barista who stands out to me every time i come in she is ALWAYS so bubbly and happy. She brings in a energy that seems to make a lot of your costumers happy. I love the fact that she takes the time to genuinely keep good conversations with what seems like her \""Regulars.\"" Its awesome to come in having my coffee made before i can even get to the counter to pay for it. You definitely need more baristas like her."
4,"I brought my husband in to buy a new mountain bike for Christmas. The salesmen were great about answering his questions, and the mechanic took time to make sure the bike was ready to go. We were very impressed by the company's guarantee and  loyalty program. It really can't be beat! Plus, their price on the bike beat others we had looked at with the same features."
4,"We had a Sunday brunch here and it was terrific.  I would caution only about the stairs, as they are very tall. There is an elevator, so if you have your high, high heels on be warned. The hostess did not offer us any options, which got us off to a pretty poor start.  After being seated it all went Fabulous!!  The dishes are very tasty and flavorful. Organic Grass Fee Beef was very good. They have butchers on the premises and offer great quality meats.  Ground beef was on special for $1.99 Per Pound.  What a great price!  Be ready to try new things:)"
2,"It's hard to complain about this place given the price I got it for! \n**Warning** This is a long review, there is a lot to break down.\n\nB -- S\n-- Grandparents have an Interval International timeshare so they booked this place for a week for me\n-- 2 br suite really means 2 adjointed rooms (1 being a jr suite & the other being a regular suit w/ patio)\n-- Located about 10 mins from The Las Vegas Strip\n-- Plenty of free parking and shaded spots\n-- 24 hour pool, say what! BBQ grills available for use\n-- Exercise room\n-- Free shuttle\n-- Paid wireless $10 - $30 (I forget the exact price for how much)\n\nOK, so this place isn't the \""gem of Las Vegas.\"" Let's just put that out there! For what it is, it's actually a decent place. My Grammie got me a 2 bedroom suite for a week for under $400. If you can find a place to sleep 6 - 10 people for that amount, let me know! And if it's in old town Las Vegas, no thank you. You can see the sign as you drive down Tropicana, just hang a left and there it is on the left side.\n\nSo let's talk about service. The front desk was very friendly, let us check in a little bit early. And took care of anything we needed but let me tell you I've done Las Vegas more than a few times, so my group didn't need much. Housekeeping happens like after a few days so we checked in Tuesday and got our rooms cleaned on Friday/Saturday. In addition to cleaning our rooms, we received plenty of towels, blankets, pillows on demand.\n\nThe room was decent. It's not the Ritz Carlton by no means. My GF & I shared the single jr suite room. It had a decent size closet, dresser, & bathroom. The bathroom was cool, nothing special. The shower did have a nice size bathtub so you could take a relaxing bath. Our toilet clogged up but they sent someone right up and it was good for the rest of the week. The bed was pretty comfortable, pillows and blankets better than a cheap motel. The AC worked awesome and kept both of the rooms very cool. It was nice to have a mini kitchen with a fridge for our stuff and a sink. We also had cups and plates. I was pretty pleased with the room in general.\n\nOur friends shared the adjointed room next door. It had almost a full kitchen with oven and microwave, a dining table plus sofa sleeper. The balcony patio was cool but it faced the road instead of the pool. The full size fridge came in handy for supplies and food. Oh yeah, washer and dryer plus complimentary laundry soap! We all did some laundry!\n\nThe pool was NOT very clean. The hot tub had a whole crap load of leaves in there. I wasn't impressed with the pool but the 24 hours was nice. We didn't really take advantage of it though.\n\nThe exercise room was decent. It had a stationary bike, treadmill and stairmaster (I think). It also had a full body work out machine that you could do all the basic exercises with weights. They do stock towels there for you and your sweat which was nice.\n\nHonestly since I had a rental car, the distance from the strip was just fine. If I wanted to do Las Vegas on the strip with no rental car, I wouldn't stay here. My friends used the shuttle and you're not getting anywhere fast on that thing. In addition it takes a while to get from point A to point B. \n\nAll in all I would rate this place at around 3.5 stars. It's better than an average motel and it's pretty cheap and decent! I will say that I didn't really hear any neighbors or anything but I wasn't in my room from 7pm to 7am, lol. I was in Las Vegas for the Electronic Daisy Carnival!"
3,"As good as it gets!  I love the gel coat that uses the LED technology, not to worry about sunscreen like the UV.  It lasts easily for 2 weeks on my nails.  I have been going to Pamela for over a year and she helped me take charge of my weak nails.  Before getting the gel treatment I could not go a week without needing to repair a split/torn nail.  My nails look healthier and maintain the look for a good two weeks.  I followed Pam to her new studio six months ago rather than try a new nail specialist, and she has not let me down.  Convenient just off Eastern too."
0,Had my lashes taken off after having a Cleo done and only  1 fill. this place is unprofessional and a rip off! I wouldn't refer anyone here! Their lashes aren't even real mink! Waste of time and money! Shouldn't even get 1 star! Cherry lash lounge just lost a good customer! They say a fill in 2 weeks or less is just a regular fill and 2-3 is a fill plus. When I got my Cleo done no one informed me that I need to book a fill plus everytime even it's been 1 week  2 week or 3 weeks. If your going here to get a Cleo or want full lashes if most the lashes fall out by your next fill and your not scheduled for a fill plus your just sol and stuck w gaps between your lashes and barely any lashes even after fill. Even if it's the receptionist fault that your appointment wasn't booked right your still sol!They just wanna get people in and out and get there money. They don't care about customer service. So if u go here and aren't happy with your lashes at sum point they will do nothing! These people need to learn how to run a real business and not keep charging people for dumb stuff and rip them off!!! Look at sum of their reviews are only 1 stars due to them running a bad business! I had refered some of my girlfriends here that no longer will be going to cherry to get their lashes done.
4,"This place is MUCH better than the restaurants that were in its place before.  First of all, the complimentary chips come with 3 dips- 1 red salsa (roasted chipotle I believe), 1 green salsa (avocado and tomatillo- my fave!), and a simple bean dip.  All three are delicious!  I could have just that and a margarita and be set.  I ordered the chicken flautas with a side of guacamole.  The guacamole was simple (I hate when restaurants try to throw too much in there) and the flautas were crispy without being over done.  I drank a regular margarita and then I went ahead tried a coconut lime margarita since it sounded intriguing.  I was surprised at how good it was!  Not too sweet, but not bland either.  Surprisingly delicious!  I ate in the bar area and the food came out quickly.  The service and prices were great!"
1,"+.+.+.+.+.+Two Things Have Changed in the Past 30 Days +.+.+.+.+.+.+\n\nPRICES have been  increasing quite frequently ...... and they just did it again.\nEnough is enough ...... They now have become very expensive.\nWe'll still continue going here ........ reducing our visits by 50%.\nThere's a wonderful Chinese restaurant at Shea and 92nd Street that gives much  larger portions ..... at about the same price as Flo's.\n\nSecondly the remodel is Beautiful ..... However, why wasn't the Rock Concert noise level remedied ?????"
2,"Not the greatest hotel on the strip, but it was worth its price.\n\nWe came here for a quick spring-break get-away.  It wasn't as magical as I remember it when I was a kid, but thatt's to be expected.  Sadly, Las Vegas has shied away from kid-friendly to more adult themed (well, as it should be).  Circus circus seems pretty ghetto (again, it could be that I'm older now...) and the games area in Excalibur has seen better days.\n\nIt's sad that I don't gamble, my wife and I won a ton of stuffed animals for around $50.  My profile pic is my baby surrounded by our pilage of the games area.  If only that luck transferred to the tables or slots, I would be rich!\n\nOh yeah, there are dancers of the pleasure palace.  Takes a lot of confidence to dance on a table in a hotel with just your underwear on.  I'll just be nice and say good luck to all of them..."
1,"I've had better Indian food, especially for the price.  But, they are in the old port of Montreal, someone has to pay for that rent!  I've also had better service, the waiter was a real jack ass.  The guy I went with did not leave a tip due to the poor service, and the waiter followed us into the street accosting him for a tip.\n\nI ordered saag paneer ($17), it tasted good but it arrived in small quantity, and the naan, while good is expensive at $4 per piece.   Note that they also close between lunch and dinner seating's. \n\nI do not plan on returning to this restaurant"
3,Very nice and grassy park- I wish the seating would get washed down more often or some bleacher type seating was installed- but over all very nice- people usually pick up after their dogs here.
0,What gives?  Donated items at over inflated prices...wump....wump....
3,"I have been going to this hard to find place for years.  It was recommended by a friend from the frist moment I bit into the crispy crust I was hooked. \nI will talk about the food in a moment but my favorite part of Classic Italian is that I have introduced some other friends to this place and they went on to be hard, hard core regulars.  Dinning there a few times a week for about five years now.  \n\nThe pizza is European Style.  Individual pizza, thin crust with fresh toppings.  I especially love the fresh Prosucitto and basil pie. \nTheir Tomato salad is excellent and the bread sticks and mariana sauce is some of the best in town.  Love it!"
2,"We have dined at the Old Town Tortilla Factory several times over the years and as recently as two weeks ago.  \n\nThe outdoor seating area is very nice, there is a roomy bar and fairly large indoor restaurant (I agree with Sarah K., bring a sweater).  \n\nThe Chorizo Fundido is delicious!!  They serve it with a large bowl of chips.  I always ask for a side of soft corn tortillas too, they are a nice change from the chips. \n\nThe Plato Appertivo is gigantic, you could feed four people with this thing.  The nachos, ribs and quesadillas were all fantastic.  There is a generous scoop of their great guacamole on top and a bowl of salsa on the side.  You might want to ask for the chipotle sour cream on the side rather than on the quesadillas - it has a great smoky taste but can dominate easily so I prefer to regulate the portion.\n\nThe enchiladas and soft tacos are very good.  Their flour tortillas are great (when they bring them).\n\nMargaritas were excellent and generous for the price.\n\nService can be spotty.  If you're in a rush or are frustrated by slow service to the point it impacts your food enjoyment, this place may not be your cup of tea.  I enjoy the food/drinks so I go when I know I have the time to be patient.  Test it out during a leisurely happy hour and see what you think."
0,Messed up my order the told me it was what I ordered. What I ordered was not even a soup but that's what I got. Then I had to pay for it? Won't be going back!
3,"Nail Envy is a great little nail shop in the unassuming Mt. Lebanon Shops strip mall.  My critique of a nail shop or spa is typically centered around the cleanliness of the shop and equipment, and whether I'm treated to personal attention or not (am I juggled between other clients).  \n\nNail Envy meets my cleanliness standards, I've never had to turn down the full mani/pedi for just a polish change (as I've had to do in other establishments once I saw their tools!).  No, they keep their shop, tools and equipment in tip-top shape and I'm never nervous to have them really go to town on my cuticles or roughed-up heels.  \n\nI've been here three or four times now, always as a walk-in (no pre-set appt) and have not yet had to wait at all.  There's always been someone available to take me immediately and they've never juggled me and another client, I always get my own nail tech personally dedicated to me. This makes for a much more efficient and speedy mani/pedi and as I'm usually in a rush...I appreciate this.  \n\nA tip: I once went in and got just a pedi (as opposed to my typical mani/pedi combo) because I was in a hurry....it was the same price as the mani/pedi combo and I felt sort of cheated.  For the best value, get the combo...the pedi price alone is a bit steep.  \n\nAlso, although they do accept credit cards, tipping can only be done with cash."
4,"I'm always disappointed in my pedicure massages ... Until today! Mai gave what was HANDS DOWN the best pedicure and massage I've experienced! Just got the basic standard pedicure and the massage seemed to never end and was firm but not painful and sooo relaxing! Amazing place! 25 minutes from my home and 10,000 places I could go in between but ill be making the drive regularly! Totally worth it!!!"
3,This place is absolutely a treat.... Great dessert section portions are perfect bite. I had wine paring with mine
0,I went there last week it wasn't even busy I waited 15 plus min and no one came to take my order! I had to walk out of this joint   It should be ashamed to be have a location on old town and piss people off and run their business like an amateur little kids! I hope you guys shut down very soon!
1,"I expected so much more from Wynn.  We were invited by the Casino host Mr. Brando as we were about to cash out our chips.   We went for their infamous Champagne Brunch.  That Sunday was crowded but we didn't mind because the host said go straight to the VIP/Invited guest line, and tell them I sent you there and if theres a problem call my desk.  \n\nAs soon as we got to the front of the line, the rude cashier said to us go back to the end of the line bc you don't have a fast pass??  And before I could say anything she yelled out \""NEXT!!!\""\nI\n said to her,  \""wait... call the casino host they've invited us.  Here's our players club please look it up for our complimentary meal.\""  \n\nWhen we sat down, wasn't until 2 trips to the buffet line when our waitress finally came out and asked, \""what would you like to drink???\"" \n\nWe've both responded \""Champagne brunch please...\""  \n\nShe replied \""You have to pay extra for that!\""  \n\nAgain, I had to explain to her the Casino's host invited us if you have any problem just call the desk.  She didn't bother either instead just offer us water.  \n\nI must say the lack of customer service probably went down hill because it was overcrowded.  However, we're at the Wynn and not Circus Circus.  Obviously we didn't have problem paying $50/person meal when we were playing $500-$1000 hand probably the only reason why we were invited for complimentary meal.  Regardless, we've been to plenty of fine establishments and we've never been treated the way we did.  You would think at a 5-star resort place like this would have a superb customer service.  I guess I was too distracted by the pretty decor.\n\n**UPDATE:  Mr. Brando have been addressed with these issues and he's doing everything in his power to make-up for our bad experience.  He handled the issue very professional and we would definitely come back because of him."
2,"Came in for lunch with family. Food was great however the service today was not.  We ordered our drinks and it took the waitress about 20 mins to come back with them after she served a group of 6 that came in after us.  She had someone else bring us our drinks and it was probably because I kept looking around to find her.  When she came to take our order she seemed like she didn't really want to be at work or something because her response to our questions were one word.  I ordered the king crab with a baked potato and asked for the crab to be cracked and no chives on my potato. After placing our order, she tells us in a rude manner \""is that all\"".  The complimentary salad was not fresh and taste odd. Once we received our order, the server placed a \""hot\"" plate in front of my son and swooshed his hand when he attempted to touch it.  I understand not wanting him to burn himself but why place it directly in front of him if it's that hot?  The plate was not hot at all as the server mentioned and I was pretty upset with her swooshing my son's hand away.  When my king crab and potato came, it was not cracked and I had an overwhelming amount of chives on my potato.  I did not receive anything to crack them with, butter, or anything that normally comes with a crab lunch/dinner order.  I asked if they could be taken back and cracked and the server says \""oh I forgot to put that in the computer\"". Not a problem. She takes them back and it takes 10 mins to get them back. We eat our meal, and our server does not return for quiet sometime. We see her waiting on other tables but she never makes it back to our table until I begin looking around for her again. She finally comes and ask if we need anything and refills our drinks.  We finish our meal, pay and leave. We have never had bad service prior to this visit, and I give 3 stars because the food was good as always. Service could have been so much more better. Hopefully next time we visit it will be great service."
2,"Had lunch with a colleague on a Thursday. Look over the Bento selections and against my better judgement went with the Salmon Teriyaki. Not good, not bad just very average. \nI like the happy hour, it is always a lively time and drink and food specials are great and deserve 4 stars. Just was not impressed with lunch there."
3,Love the lunch specials here.  Such a great spot for lunch and the food is delicious.  The service has always been great too.
2,"We enjoyed this buffet. It was a little too pricey considering the Bellagio (which is awesome) is only a few dollars more. But there was quite a variety of items, and staff were pleasant. Not sure if I would return with all the other options on the strip."
1,"Friday night at 8:00 and the place was empty and i am pretty sure i know why.\nThe selections are normal for an AYCE sushi place. The rice was not sticking to most of the rolls and i was worried they would think i was not trying to eat it.\nThe \""Lasagna\"" was the worst!!! There was around an inch of cream cheese on top and just dominated any other flavor. The cut of the roll was so big i couldn't fit it into my mouth and by trying to cut it with chop stix turned it into a complete pile of mush.\nTHere were a few descent rolls but not worth going back."
4,"I am writing a review of Mansions as a music venue.  This is a unique location to dine and listen to live music.  Because it's a small hotel, the staff is very attentive to the smallest needs and is very willing to help.  It's fun just to look around the place.  The acoustics are wonderful for live music, there's a lot of beautiful woodwork, and so the sound is live and warm.  I have eaten at the brunch and the food was wonderful, lots of choices from a buffet, and top quality and well prepared food.    Definitely worth visiting.  I will come back often."
2,"Tucked in the corner of Greenway and Tatum, sits The Corn Flower.  I went in for lunch, very simple setup with a friendly staff.  I ordered the chili renello and an empanada.   It was a pretty small amount for the cost you pay for a chili renello.  Just one with a red sauce on top and a side of rice.  Nothing much to the rice.  The chili renello was good but not really filling.  The empanada that I tried was the chicken mole, tasty for sure.  I think the empanadas was the highlight of the lunch.  May go back and try some other items.  It's worth checking out due to the variety of empanadas they have that you can take home and bake or eat there."
1,"I really hate their food. Everything is disgusting. The wings, the shrimp, the oysters, EVERYTHING. We went there and I love fish and chips so I ordered it. One bite and I was done. It was awful. Puke worthy awful. I ended up only eating the curly fries that came with it. Anyway, the manager noticed I didn't eat any of it, so he decided to take it off our bill which was super nice. It was one star food, but because the manager was nice enough to acknowledge the fact that I didn't like it so I shouldn't have had to pay for it, was why they got another star. Way to go on customer service!"
1,"Disgusting food, disgusting desserts. \n\nIt's all superficial here - everything looks good until you take a bite out of it. The pastas and noodles were overcooked and oversauced, the fried foods (you usually can't go wrong with those) were good until I bit into one that was all breading and oil, and the mac n' cheese didn't fail to disappoint.\n\nThe desserts were bitter or plain disgusting and the soft serve ice cream was icy and cheap tasting. The cookies, which looked really good - did not live up to their looks.\n\nI do give Hometown Buffet two stars however, for their dinner rolls and mushrooms. THOSE, well... Those were pretty awesome."
3,"You know what? This place ain't half bad. At least not as bad as how all the reviewers have been making it look like. But it seems like everyone is bitching about the general \""inexperience\"" of the security staff above anything else. I got let in pretty quickly and even had a nerdy stocky lady bouncer give phone directions to my friends over my phone without attitude or trouble.\n\nIf you read my other reviews, you know it's very difficult for me to speak positively on stuff like this in general. So congratulations Hakkasan! You didn't piss me off! And you put a smile on my face!\n\nAsians almost never smile!\n\nHowever, we did have comped tables thanks to a friend that has close connections with the senior staff in this venue. So I am reviewing this place based on a pretty concise VIP treatment. \n\nOur host is fairly attentive and so is her busser. Never, once, have I ever needed to ask her to fill my drink when I was going dry. Which was a issue I had at 1-Oak where I had to fill my own glasses.\n\nThe best way I can describe Hakkasan is that it's just like Tao. It has a Asian theme, and has a restaurant downstairs. However, it is not as douchy as Tao. Now given, I seen a few catfights between girls jump off right in front of me in the hip hop room, and this being my first day, it does embarass and make the club look bad. But hey, at least I didn't get into a fight for the bathroom line like I did in Tao (read my Tao review), because there are more than FOUR bathrooms with NO LINES!\n\nAnother reviewer is complaining about the \""bitchiness\"" of Asian girls in the club. Personally, I never had this problem because not only do I NOT talk to random Asian girls that are looking for their rich White Knight with a green card, but I have my own friend circle of hot Asians with me :p \n\nThe key is building your hot friend networks OUTSIDE the party scene, because anyone who thinks that they can get laid on the first night of meeting a girl at a club will just catch a nasty case of herpes, and HIV if they are unfortunate (:\n\nI enter the club with people I know, and leave the club with the same folks. And for anyone I met that night, ill hit them up the next day after giving them time to think about me (:\n\nThat's how you stay safe, and not missing any kidneys the next morning!"
3,"Takes a long time to clean up table. But its understandable cos grill is hot n need cool down, i suppose. The price is really good but the meat, especially the short ribs are not tender. \nI would not be a regular here, just because the smell afterward in your clothes is horrific, we suppose plan go Hakasan  right after dinner. But once i get in the car, that BBQ smell is just a turn off. So word of advice is that make sure your next stop is shower lol.\n\nI wish there is a 3.5 start, because that is what it earned."
1,"Having just gotten back from Hawaii 2 weeks ago and being asked \""what island are you from\"" from our server earlier that day, we headed over to Hawaiian Marketplace with high expectations.  I was also looking for malasadas ...\n\nIt's disappointing here.  Still, we found a tix4tonight booth so it wasn't a total loss.  For those of you looking for a bit of the island flavor during your visit to LV, don't bother, you won't find it here."
2,"All you can eat sushi for $26.99 when you're famished and options that aren't crowded in the area are limited - Sold!  Not the best sushi I have ever had, but not the worst either, kinda middle of the road. Never heard of sushi pizza - \nthought it was original and pretty tasty.  Chicken dumplings were light/non greasy and deserve a mention as well.  Good food for a reasonable price and decent customer service. :-)."
1,"Well, they definitely enforce the dress code. Ladies, don't rely on your looks! If you aren't wearing the shortest dress ever, forget it. The club felt like a cheesy version of Vegas and everything was totally overpriced. If not for the good company of friends, I would've peaced out to a more comfortable club.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this club is the entire attitude. On their Facebook page they happily say Scottsdale is \""going downhill\"" and credit themselves with bringing them out of it by having a retarded dress code. They think the \""upper class\"" should remain the upper class. Right, you charge $10 for a cover in Arizona. Go to LA where they charge $45 or more for a mediocre club and get back to me about that upper class. \n\n\nOnly pros - the bathroom was interesting. Bizarre really. Not bad, not good, just different. Good place for hitting on people. The staff was actually strangely nice to people in line. One guy was particularly hot and funky."
3,"Now I had a good excuse to go to the mall. I need to go for early voting! \n \nThis polling place is located inside the mall on the first level out in front of Kohls. It doesn't matter what precinct you're assigned to, any registered voter can vote here during early vote week. The lines were long but there were plenty of election monitors and the polling place here was well staffed and organized. So it was a relatively a short wait in line.\n\nEveryone that I encountered was pleasant and professional. As I got to the front of the line a polling assistant lead me to one of the election clerks sitting at the tables. Since I took the address label from my voter ballot with me, all they had to do was scan the barcode.  You don't have to bring your sample ballot but it does make the process move faster.  Verification is determined by the signature match on file, birthdate and address. Election clerk did not ask for any ID.  After signature verification, I was handed a plastic card and led to the polling area. From there the poll worker let me know which election monitor is available.\n  \nThe election monitors are touch screen and are activated once you insert the card inside the machine. Think ATM machine...that's how these monitors operate.  These screens were super sensitive I noticed.  Just a slight touch of the screen was all it took.  I followed the easy to read prompts on the monitor, made my choices, watched my ballot get printed and made sure it was all correct then casted my vote. Voila!!  It took about 3 minutes total. Your card ejects and as you exit just hand it to the poll worker collecting it.  Another poll worker handed me my \""I Voted!\"" sticker. That's it! Whole process was real easy."
4,"Spectacular food and service. We started with the blue shrimp salad which was prepared with an orange sauce - out of this world! My wife had the veal and I had the ahi tuna, both were marvelously presented and tasted phenomenal. Eat bite was savored. We pair our meals with the four vine Chardonnay (meat), and the Pinot noir (fish). Great choices. For dessert we had the apple crumble prepared in a bourbon sauce. That was the only part of the meal we would only give four stars. Everything else was five star.\n\nThe one drawback was the overwhelming noisy atmosphere. Might be their design intention though. We would recommend!"
1,"It's apparent the kitchen has no idea how to operate.  The food was good.  I was not upset with that. However 50 mins for bbq is absurd.  Bbq should be done. \n\nThe owners friend sat next to us and they had no problem getting food early with prompt service. We however, were not given the same respect or service from staff...\n\nIt's unfortunate because I was really looking forward to trying this place in hopes for good bbq in LV"
2,"Oliveo's is a good place to get decent food, whether it's late night or lunchtime. They are slightly pricey, at least to me, but it is Greek food. I have never gotten a bad dish from them. I've had the chicken souvlaki, gyros and chicken breast plates. All are great, cooked well and have lots of flavor. The bonus is that Oliveo's is open extremely late, so they are usually my go to if I want late night food that isn't McDonald's. I recommend if you want healthy in a college town!"
4,Really good choice for Gluten Ftee.  DELICIOUS bread.  Lots of choices for fixins.  Just as delicious as when we visited Ikes in San Francisco.
4,"I don't think too many people know that this place opens at 2:00 one day a year.  That was today, Thanksgiving, and it was the best Thanksgiving dinner my new mate and I ever had in our lives.  If you didn't have Thanksgiving dinner here, I don't believe you had the best.  Nice, comfortable booth in a nice, comfortable room with exceptional service from nice, well mannered people.  Woohoo! is Right!!!"
4,"So far this is the best buffet I have been to in the valley, awesome breakfast/brunch/diner/seafood.  The price for what it is, is pretty fair.  Almost everything here is really good, I like the root beer they have on tap.  Also the dessert bar they have in incredible, I mean really I have never seen anything like it, the desert bar is bigger than some buffets as a whole. I have been here 10+ times and will come 10+ more. 4.3 stars"
2,"not sure why people love this place. It is unique but not chic, more bohemian or punk i think...if u r into Italian designers, this is not ur place"
2,"I like Marche Bacchus a lot. But I definitely go there for the food, the wine and the view, not the service. \n\nWe've been there numerous times and each time it seems the service gets a little worse. Our first server there was great, friendly, fast, and always smiling! I found the  food on that visit was simply mediocre, though my fiance really enjoyed it, so we went back again. \n\nFrom that point onward, the food got better as the service just got worse. Our most recent time, our waiter completely forgot to give us water and it took over half an hour just to get our meals! This was at lunchtime, and both of us had ordered simple soup and sandwich combos, in a mostly empty patio, so I really don't think it's excusable. The sandwiches were great, though I thought the chilled soup much too sweet: almost like a melted ice cream.\n\nAnyway, I definitely recommend this place to anyone that isn't in a rush and has an hour and a half to two hours to spend in a picturesque setting with delicious french food. \n\nThe bread pudding is to DIE for!"
1,Went once. Las Fuentas is sooooo much better! No need to go back here
4,I have been going to this place for a few years. They made a point to know my name and it gives me the warm and fuzzies! I would say everything is good except I am not a fan of cold spring rolls. I love the presentation of the pho...you get a friggen salad to make your own little creation. The mango chicken is awesome and something I crave often. They make a great Mango spicy shrimp salad that rocks with a little kick. And their Chicken fried rice has ruined me for so many others. It is so good that I can't eat it anywhere else! Great for Carryout or dine in.
1,"Good for a dessert place, bad for food.  \n\nCame here on a Sunday for brunch super hungry.  We waited 30 minutes to be seated and ended up sitting outside on the patio in 106 degree heat.  While they have fans with water misters, they don't reach certain tables.  I had to ask the hostess to move to a better table where we would get at least some mist.  The outside patio is covered by a pink tarp which gave everything a bright pink glare.  Bring sunglasses!\n\nWe were starving by the time we were seated.  We waited 5 minutes for a server to take our drink order.  By this time we already knew what we wanted to order so we placed our order.  I got an LEO omelet and the main squeeze ordered a  burger.   It took 10 minutes for us to get our water and another 10 minutes to get our food.   My omelet was all egg and hardly any onions and salmon.  It tasted dry and salty.  The burger was okay.  It seemed like forever until we found the waitress to ask for our check.  We ordered a cookies and cream milkshake to go. That came back 5 minutes later along with our check.  \n\nMy experience here was pretty bad.  I feel like it was a waste of time and energy sitting around waiting, waiting, and waiting for food that wasn't even good.  The best part of the whole experience was the milkshake--it was delicious."
2,"A few friends and I visited Studio Vino to do the wine tasting.  We got 10 samples of wine along with a cheese tray and a fun snack selection with cookies, nuts, and chocolates.  We really enjoyed being able to select wines from Studio Vino as well as other Arizona wineries.  The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming and overall it was a pleasant experience. The reason for the three stars is that service was very slow.  It took almost two hours to complete our wine sampling.  We had initially wanted to sample and then order wine but we were running so short on time some of us ended up ordering a glass before our sampling was even complete.  My advice: plan to spend a while and if you have questions you may want to ask Kari (who seems to run the place) because our server didn't seem too confidant on the wines and pairings.  Otherwise, it's a great atmosphere and we had a fun girls night out. :)"
0,"Was there on Sunday afternoon with my wife. Maybe 5 customers in the place, but the service from the bartender was absolutely nonexistent. Will never go back!"
0,BAD BAD BAD!!! Need I honestly say more?? Bad service and bad wings!! What else would I go for?!?!? Wings taste like the Kroger brand hot sauce. Do yourself a favor and go to Native New Yorker.
1,"At first I couldn't understand the bad reviews for a walmart. Seriously it's a walmart, they never excel, but now I get it . I hate hate hate how the money center is separate, feels like a yellow jail in there.. And there's ALWAYS a long line. Definitely had to dig deep on the patience. Plus when I went to buy a laundry basket, they were on the top shelf, and little 5'1 me had a hell of a time getting it down. No it's ok ! I got it.. Grrr.. Anyways a walmart is a walmart, I'm just saying this isent my favorite one ."
3,Great show. Half the cost of other shows and as most reviews have already said. \nDo it!!!!! Not a bad seat in the house is also true. Perfect view as rows are low enough\nthat your not looking at the back of someone's head.
3,"My grandma was in the ICU for three weeks before she passed away and let me tell you that the nurses and chaplains here were so awesome! They knew we were going through a hard time and let us stay all the time and even accommodated my entire family when we were all in my grandma's room with her. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because sometimes the doctors can be prima donna's. They are entitled to be that way sometimes considering all the experience and school they have but still. We had an awesome nurse who was very helpful and went out of her way to get us answers. One of the doctors didn't like that so they had her moved do a different area! Overall though, we had a good experience here."
4,"We had intended to go to another restaurant in the area that we discovered was closed. So, we thought we would try this new place and were pleasantly surprised. I had the corned-beef hash wrap from the breakfast menu and it was delish! It came with a generous side of fruit. My companions had the bleu cheese bacon burger and the roast beef baguette. My only complaint is that they don't have brewed iced tea. Otherwise, we had no problems and would definitely return."
0,"I have been here twice, both times had an awful experience. I went somewhere else and purchased the same outfit for less than it cost at men's warehouse to buy. That wasn't really the issue, since I was willing to spend the money. The true issue was the lack of customer service.....least helpful salesmen ever...."
1,"I recommend spending the extra money at the Bacchanal buffet in Caesars Palace! The first time I went to this buffet 12 years ago I loved it, but we recently were staying at the Mandalay Bay for a night and wanted to just dine in the area. It costed a little over $30/adult and $20 for my 5 year old. The food selection was not as much as what I remember it to be and it just seemed over priced. The quality was good, just disappointed on the lack of selections and having to wait for certain food items. I would not go back just because there are so many other places to choose from in Vegas. I would also rather pay $50/person at the bigger resort/casinos for a better selection of food/seafood."
2,"Yo tasty, yo tasty, yo tasty yo!\n\nTasty Yo has frozen yogurt that is all good for you and stuff, but it's only one flavor, and it can have that funky fro yo aftertaste, which sucks.  On that note, Yoforia is better.\n\nBut for toppings, I have to give the nod to Tasty Yo, both because they have some suggestions on the board which means you don't have to figure out what to put on your \""yo\"" (uh, well, I trust you know what I mean, yo?), and because they do it for you, which means that you don't have to deal with someone else's nasty hands digging into the bowls.\n\nThe other thing that is cool is the serving size is perfectly reasonable.  You get a bowl that looks about like what you'll end up with - even a pretty little swirl on top (think DQ).  Then they give you up to three toppings.  That's nice.\n\nAt Yoforia, for example, you get these bowls that are so big that you can almost bathe in them.  Then when you fill it up with everything you can, they weigh the bowl and you pay by the ounce, which means you need to take out a mortgage to buy your yo.  Yo.  So again, Tasty Yo wins.\n\nThe only downside is that the place looks like a dorm room.  It is a decent dorm room, and they (apparently) have wifi.  If you do foursquare, you can check in for the first time and get a discount.  If you're the mayor, the deal is even better.  But it's still a dorm room, yo."
0,"FYI, this place has closed its doors."
2,I went to the new location awhile back and it is okay.  If you like bbq then this place has to be on your list to try in Las Vegas.
0,"Susie's estate sales is a big rip off. All of their stuff is extremely overpriced so they can tell their client that their stuff didn't sell, which forces the client to \""donate\"" their stuff. Then, Susie's takes the stuff and sells it behind the client's back to make a profit. It's obvious that they are doing this since they don't seem to care about no one buying anything, even if it's the last day of the sale.The one bigger woman who works there is a complete snob about it too. You don't even want to negotiate with them because they are so rude. Oh! and don't say you love garage selling. Or Susie will rip you a new one since they consider themselves to be \""elite\"" and not in the garage sale category. If you want to spend a hundred bucks on a crappy southwestern lamp you could get at goodwill for $5, then Susie's estate sale might be for you. Or you might get lucky to buy a $3500 table and chairs on their 25% off day. I usually don't write reviews, but i feel like it's my duty to warn people when they are obviously ripping off their clients. For that kind of money, your better off going to an actual store. At least, you would get better customer service when your dropping that kind of money."
3,"I've had this place bookmarked for a year now.  This is located in the same lot as Einstein Bros Bagels, Mr. Sandwich and Wells Fargo across the street from UNLV. I was worried about this place being packed with students at lunch time but good thing it wasn't. The strip mall doesn't look promising but once you get inside the restaurant, it's a different world.\n\nI was meeting somebody for lunch but they were running a bit late but the servers kept me occupied. I'd definitely have to say the service was EXCELLENT. Very attentive, very friendly and they offered a high chair for the little man.\n\nWe had the Thai tea float, belly rice, salmon poke stack, 28GO roll, gogi beef waffle and J dog: kompleto.\n\nThai Tea Float:\nI love Thai tea and I love Thai tea float even more. The Thai tea itself tastes a bit different so I stirred the vanilla ice cream in there real well to mask the taste. I've had better but I appreciate this being on the menu. 3.5/5\n\nBelly Rice:\nTender braised pork belly served on steamed white rice with nori shreds and green onion on top. The sauce is sweet and tangy at the same time which cuts down the fattiness of the pork belly. 4/5\n\n28Salmon Poke Stack:\nFresh salmon cubes in sesame-soy blue agave nectar wasabi oil with seaweed salad, fried gyoza wrapper and greens. The dressing was mild and I think a little bit more of wasabi oil would make this dish pop. The fried gyoza wrapper added crunch. The salmon tasted fresh. 4/5\n\nGogi Beef Stuffed Waffle:\nBulgogi in a waffle folded in half served with syrup, 2 eggs and GOcatsup. Sweet bulgogi, sweet waffle. Very interesting combination. 4/5\n\n28GO Roll:\nPork belly, scallions wrapped in kimchee. Our server explained to us to start from bottom left to top right - mild to hot. You can barely taste the pork belly. But if you absolutely love kimchee, go ahead and try this dish. 3.5/5\n\nJ Dog: Kompleto:\nGrilled Kosher hotdog, kimchee, American cheese on a grilled hotdog bun. A little bit on the salty side. I think an Asian slaw would add the tang this was lacking to cut down the saltiness. 3.5/5\n\nTapas here are from $4-9.50. Entrees from $8.50-15. They also have ramen and desserts."
0,"The food was good. The service was horrible. The waitress spoke 10 words if at all to us. She was not happy being there. Manager was walking around but never checked in with us to see how was the food.  I ordered an ice tea and got one glass of it. no refill even after owner/manager passed by table saw the empty glass at the edge of the table 2 times. Waitress brought food, served over empty glass and did not asks us for a refill. The busser passed the table 3 times and saw the empty glass and did not offer more. I had to ask her for some more after that. I had a coupon for dinner and it stipulated that we had to leave 20% tip.. waitress ended up with a tip of around $17.00 for the worst service ever.. very disappointing and vouched not to go back. the restaurant needs a new decor also.. very dated. Save your hard earned money and go somewhere else.."
0,"Think twice before ordering online or by phone from this florist.\n\nI ordered a $185 \""European Basket\"" to be sent to a friend.  What was shown on their website was truly beautiful.  What arrived didn't even remotely resemble the photo.  I realize that florists reserve the right to make changes in an arrangement based upon availability,etc.  However, we are not talking about that here.  The entire arrangement was different.  As if someone got 2 orders mixed up and my recipient ended up with the ugly one.\nIt would not have been difficult for Cactus Flowers to pick up the phone and let me know that what I ordered was something that they were not able to produce presently.  And then worked with me to find a satisfying solution.  Instead I am left feeling like I was taken by this company, and my friend has received an ugly arrangement that I did not order, should NEVER have been charged $185 for, and am embarrassed to even have my name attached to it.\nBased on my experience, I will never do business with Cactus Flowers again.  If you have no option but them, think long and hard about doing internet or phone orders.   There are plenty of other florists in the valley that deserve the business."
3,"Had the miso soup and that was great and tasty. The gyoza pork came our not fried, and wasn't sure is gyoza suppose to be fried? In any case it was very good. The rolls had more fish than rice and that was great. Tasted fresh. I had the ocean roll. The ginger on the side though see less tasty and old. The wasabi was not a bright green but dull green, not sure why or was it too old? On any case I would eat there again. It's better than the fast food places, but it will cost some more as any other sushi place."
4,Been there 4 times already and Hot n Juicy has not disappoint our family!!!! Awesome service by Myra and Trent and great seafood. We will definitely be back. Great job !!!'
2,Under construction when I visited. Small storefront with a modest selection of comic graphic novels and action figures. Also a selection of Fangoria and similar magazines. Kinda dismal vibe but that could be the construction. They also sold some snacks and drinks.
2,"This Albertson's is okay.  \n\nI find this store to be quite expensive as compared to some of the other stores I have been to, so I don't visit this one very much.  It is close to my house though, so I do end up here occasionally.  They do have a free savings membership card you can get, which you should, that saves you some money.  Even with the membership card, the prices are still high, in my opinion.\n\nThis location is a large store with a lot of options when it comes to food, so that part is nice.  The deli is always well stocked with great sandwich meats and great cheese options.  I love me some good cheese.   They also offer a lot of handmade sides like egg, tuna, and chicken salads, cole slaw, ambrosia, amongst many others.  Whenever I get an egg salad craving I make a beeline to this store to get my fix ASAP.  Oh and the roast chicken here is divine!  The rosemary garlic flavor is delightful.  I am drooling just thinking about it!\n\nI do also have to say that the bakery at Albertson's make the best cakes in the valley.  I have had many cakes from lots of bakeries around town and I think the cakes at Albertson's are by far the yummiest! One of my favorites is the Victorian Lace cake with raspberry filling.  I have never seen it at any other bakery, which is a shame.  It is a beautiful cake and tastes even better! And yes, I have tried the big names like Freed's and I still think Albertson's has an edge on cakes.  What can I say, I LOVE cake!\n\nThis store also has a satellite USPS office inside.  This USPS location is rarely busy and you can get your stamps or mail packages quickly here.  It is a great option to have and is much faster than the main post office for the area on Tenaya.  \n\nThis location also has a Starbucks inside of it.  Yep, you can get your caffeine fix and then power grocery shop.  Talk about efficient shopping!"
4,No rating (just putting that in theater 12 there is a speaker in the front right that may be damaged. I heard a crack sound ((a sound a speaker makes when damaged))\n\nOtherwise a fun movie experience. \n\nCheers
0,"We waited over an hour for our food, which showed up to be only mediocre. They had live music which was decent."
3,"Love this place! Eating there isn't the greatest, customer service isn't always great, but the food is amazing! From kabobs to falafels, you can't go wrong. We like to order the combo for two, which is really more appropriate for 3-4 people and it's cheap too. They give you SOOOO much food for what you pay when you get the combo. The chicken kabobs are another favorite of mine. The meal comes with yellow rice too & I love me some yellow rice! The delivery driver is super nice and they deliver late. Try it out!"
1,"This place is open earlier than other breakfast spots in the area. \nThe food is standard, nothing amazing. The atmosphere is fun and the music gets you going. \nThe service is S L O W! \nIt was like pulling teeth to have our server talk to us. We asked for the bill after we ordered to expedite the process, but that never happened. I couldn't believe how this guy drug his feet. He payed a lot of attention to the people ordering off the senior menu, I guess he thought the old folks would tip better?? \nAnywho...it's a good standby but definitely not a destination..."
1,"Let me start out by saying despite the low rating, this Hilton does have some redeeming qualities: the people are friendly, it's clean, the rooms are nice, it has a decent pool.  But you can get that a lot of places.\n\nThe \""On The Las Vegas Strip\"" part of the title of the hotel is very misleading.  It is technically on the strip, yes, but it is a 20 minute walk past abandoned construction sites to get to anything other than Circus Circus.  I ended up taking taxis to get anywhere most of the time, and learned that the large building across the street had been under construction/abandoned since 2008, along with several other properties around this hotel in similar situations.  This is not \""On The Strip\"".\n\nThere's a pool bar with a menu and drinks, but there's no restaurant in this hotel.  You can go down to the first floor and order a $15 frozen pizza that they heat up for you, or have one delivered to your room, but if you want to sit down for a nice meal, you're out of luck.  This I find completely inexcusable.  I'm in Vegas for the love of Todd - I'm there to either gamble (can't do that at the hotel), eat (can't do that at the hotel), or see a show (can't do that at the hotel).  Total disappointment, and a poor representation of Hilton.\n\nIt actually seems like they're using this hotel specifically to coerce people into timeshares, although I can't believe they have good luck with it given the lack of amenities at the property.  I'm just assuming that based on the number of people I spoke with who were there on 'free' vacations if they listened to a presentation and high pressure sales pitch on timeshares.\n\nAnyway - like I said.  If you don't care about being 'on the strip' or don't mind taking a taxi every time (ranged from about $10-$20 for a one-way trip depending on traffic), and don't care about close by food options, and don't want to gamble at your hotel, this is probably fine.  But if you want the Vegas experience, head south more and actually stay on the strip."
2,"Since the Costco on MLK closed (now reopened since renovation, but is now dead to me), this has become THE Costco. You know what I'm talking about-the gas station is out of control, parking lot is always full and inside....take a valium before embarking on what is sure to be a PTSD-inducing experience. This is no fault of the staff here though which is for the most part friendly and helpful. Before I begin, take note that Costco takes Amex, Visa and cash. Do not argue with your cashier about this (I've seen people do it before). Costco will take what they take and right now it's Visa and Amex. \n\nThe problem with this Costco is the Costco Shopper. Don't act like you don't know who I'm talking about. You might be one of them. There's the sample buzzard who stops what they're doing, leaves their cart in the middle of the aisle and sprints towards a freshly cooked tray of potstickers as if it's the first thing they've eaten weeks. There's also the casual shopper who meanders through Costco like they have nowhere to be in the next 15 hours and doesn't care if anyone else does either. So they wheel their cart up the middle of each aisle and you have the misfortune of running into every third aisle.\n\nI digress. There are so many types and facets to the Costco shopper that can make a trip for a cookbook or wheel of cheese the size of a tire, a trip that will send you straight to the bar post-shopping. Not to worry, Costco carries wine and liquor, so should you need to restore sanity immediately you have a fine selection of industrial sized, name brand liquors at a good price to choose from. \n\nCostco is great for cheap gas, a wide variety of bulk items that are great for large families or singletons like myself who like to save a buck and several trips to the market for things like toilet paper. I like the gas station at Costco because there is a clear order for traffic flow and none of the nonsense line cutting that I've often experienced at regular gas stations. That being said, the lines are LONG. My suggestion is to go on a week day evening right before closing or even on a weekend evening right before closing. Saturday midday? Forget it. You'll be in line for no less than 15 minutes and still be hating life once you get to the pump because let's face it, gas is outrageous. \n\nWhen you go to this Costco, go in the mind set that the lines will be long, the customers will be in various stages of food coma however the prices will be right!"
2,"I have to echo the comments by Lauren P. on 10/21/2014. This isn't the same Bootlegger that I've grown accustomed to. It got pricey and they shouldn't command that kind of money for the food and service offered. I'm afraid to say that is is bordering on a tourist trap. Sad to see, but their agenda has obviously changed."
4,"I always enjoy Eleven for dinner, great drinks, meals and service. Never disappoints but some may find it pricey to enjoy on a regular basis. \nA great value is Eleven's Sunday brunch! For $29 you get a choice of cocktail or juice. The Cucumber Moscow Mule was so fresh and yummy! Choice of appetizer...from six fresh oysters to beignets something tasty for everyone and then an entree ranging from waffles, burgers, omelettes with bacon and so much more. All served with quality sides and attentive service. (Peet's coffee is so tasty too!) What a value! A great place to take visitors or just yourself. I have gone several times and like to keep Eleven's brunch in heavy rotation"

0,"First time buying (used)travel trailer , definitely be the last buying from here. Whatever the sales staff says about not selling units that leak or have problems, get it all in writing before you , sign anything or buy anything.\nI was told by several staff members before and during my purchase how Findlay does testing and checks out used trailers before selling them and one of my concerns I told several staff members was my concerns about leaks because I was going to be traveling to Oregon for work and living in my travel trailer. Needless to say almost exactly a month to the day of me purchasing my travel trailer I'm up in Oregon and within 2 weeks of being here, rain storm and I have leaks. I talked to the assistant manager today and the first things he wanted to know was if I got it in writing about no leaks and if I had purchased an extended warranty ( not that I expected them to put any money towards the $750 I'm about to pay to have the roof resealed, I can be considered crazy but I'm not stupid) . With the answer to both of those being no, the conversation didn't go anywhere. He didn't show no concern for there being the ever slightest possibility of me being verbally miss led to believe that they do testing for leaks or anything. Not the slightest bit of remorse that I felt like my customer experience was a bad one. He did explain that it was my right to call and talk to the general manager tomorrow because today was his day off. As if he has to tell me that and I don't know it. Which I plan to. Like I said if they tell you something that makes it sound like that's gone the extra mile for quality & reassurance about a used unit , make them give it to you in writing before you purchase anything from here. \nJust to update my experience I tried to contact the manager twice within 3 weeks unfortunately he must of been too busy to answer the phone and I had to leave a voice message both times to which I still haven't received a call back 2 months  later."
3,"Beautiful Art-Deco dinner theater with amazing talent.  A great excuse to get dressed up!\n\nBought tickets online for my hubby and my dad to see My Fair Lady when he was visiting from out of town.\n\nOnline ordering and the website is HORRIBLE.  Even the theater manager said it was best to call the box office to book tickets.  When you book your tickets online, a floor plan shows which seats are available at what tables.  When we got to the theater, there was a group already in our seats.  After talking to the house manager, he said the seats were \""first come, first serve\"" and despite seat numbers on the floor plan and tickets, the reservation was only for the table, not specific seats.  At least he accommodated us with free desert.  After that issue was resolved, it was comical watching people escorted to tables that were already full and the manager scrambling to find a table that hadn't been double booked.  Quite disappointing for an $85+ ticket.\n\nThe food was better than expected from a dinner theater in Peoria.  The only disappointing part was the salad - the egg was baked in the same pans as the cornbread muffins and was so rubbery my knife wouldn't even cut through it.  The bacon on the salad was cold and overcooked as well and would have been better from a bag.\nAll of our entrees were served warm, not hot, but the flavor was quite good on the Pork Tenderloin.  I even ate the broccoli!\n\nThe saving grace and main reason I might venture back is the wait staff and the quality of the show.  The staff is very talented (both on and off stage) and quite attentive.\n\nAll in all, $85 for 5 hours of dinner & live entertainment is a good deal, just make sure you get your own table or get to the theater extra early to line up to get your desired seats."
0,Very disappointing. Chicken quesadilla was shredded and loaded with so much queso that it was soggy. Surprised because they have such a good rep but Im going to stick with Cabo Fish Taco.
0,"Decided to get a mani and pedi done for Christmas. Started off really good quick to get on a chair for my pedi. I wanted snowflakes and the lady said she could do them. Pedi seemed really rushed. Once pedi was done went on to getting my nails done. She wasn't rushing at first but the more time pass by more people started to show and out of all the workers she was the only one rushing. As she was doing my nails she kept looking around not realizing that she is taking off a lot of the nail. Also she kept filing and filing my nails which ended up shorter than I wanted.  Everyone else was taking their times. I told her to slow down so she wouldn't mess up but sure enough, my nails Didnt turn out the way i wanted them to be done. Snowflakes don't even look like snowflakes. If she wasn't able to do the design I wanted she should of said so instead of going through with it and saying that's the best she can do. one side of my nails were done and it would of looked stupid for me to walk out with my hands looking different from each other. Never again will I go to this nail salon."
1,Had breakfast this morning. Prices are a little high for what you get.  Very disappointed that food was only Luke warm but it took quite awhile to get our food that we did't send it back.  Waitress was great. \n\nThis was the 2nd time we've been there and both times food was not hot. Not a cozy place as it is open high ceilings when tend to be noisy.
3,"I've been to ramen places all over from LA, SF, Hawaii and more, and I am a fan of Monta. It definitely has similar quality of ramen compared to many of the other places that I frequent in LA and SF. I ordered the basic staple of Tonkatsu ramen. The broth was very good, not too greasy or salty, but a great combination of pork flavors. The noodles were also well cooked, not too soft or al dente. Then comes the best part, the large pork pieces that are placed in the ramen. They are thinly sliced with a portion of fat that just makes it taste so good. I always want more, and often do order extra pork for my ramen, since they usually only give you about 2-3 pieces and after you have them, you want more. The ramen also comes with some other ingredients and if you start adding some extra ingredients, the cost of your bowl of ramen will add up (including a soft-boiled egg, extra noodles, some vegetables, and more). Overall, this is a quality ramen joint that I will definitely go back to again."
2,"Take a girl here! \n\nDo it!\n\nHannys has a great, Downtown Phoenix Location. Close to the light rail, so I rode my bike to the rail, took the train into downtown and biked on ova.\n\nI love the sexy vibe!  A  nice big square bar gives the bartenders access to all of their patrons in very workable space. Ideal for conversations and meeting new people. \n\nAlthough the food and drinks maybe a bit pricey,coming here once in a while dinner before hanging out downtown is definitely worth it!\n\nThey hand pick and place fresh flowers on their table tops nightly which provides for that sexy vibe I mentioned earlier. \n\nThe DJ is supa sneaka and hidden above the entrance in a booth. Being that this is an older building rebuilt into a bar / dinner spot they have a wicked cool abandoned Elevator shaft with a glass floor that is fun to walk on and experience some of Phoenix history and culture."
3,I've only been in Charlotte for a couple years and this is the first auto garage I've used down here. It's owned and operated by two brothers I believe. They did a great job and worked with me on the price. In the end I feel like they are a very reputable company that won't rip you off. I actually need to have some work done on my wife's car and plan on calling them to do the work.
0,"So I was skeptical about this place from the beginning of the planning stage for my trip, but the room rate was good and we were getting a spa suite which looked really cool.  Normally we try to stay at the venetian or bellagio but the pocket book was a bit light and a bargain seemed like a good idea.  This trip was to celebrate our first anniversary and it was our first true vacation since our wedding so needless to say we were very excited.   The night before our flight we called to confirm our room and it was all gravy.\n\nThe next day we arrive and are told that there was a \""problem with the suites\"" and we would be downgraded to a normal room.   I'm on my f'ing anniversary and only vacation this year and this is what I'm stuck with.  The \""manager\"" wasn't even all that apologetic, in fact she was pretty indifferent, kind of like the treatment that we have all become accustomed to receiving from airline employees... the \""I couldn't possibly care less about you\"" attitude.\n\nSo we called the four seasons, they gave us a great rate with an UPGRADE to a room that has arguably the best view of the strip in all of Vegas and treated us like royalty for our whole trip (I'm gonna write a detailed review for them as well).\n\nBottom line:  If it's a budget trip your looking for and all you need is a bed and toilet, I guess this place will suffice, but I would never (again) risk it for a special occasion or if you can afford better."
4,"Holy shit.  Bottle of some beer I never heard of and a Chimay.  Started with a black bean and chicken quesadilla.  Got the New York strip with a side of mashed potatoes (holy crap it had pesto in it?!?!?) and had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  Best food I've ever had.\n\nService was ridiculously good.  Never had to ask for anything, they sensed my desires.  Went #1 and when I got back they had folded my napkin.  Wow.\n\nOnly peeve about this place was that we had a party of 10 and had 9 people and they wouldn't seat us until the 10th got there.  Lame.  I say what the hell we're gonna spend almost 1k here just seat us and get over yourselves.\n\nBut, overall, I see why Michelin rated them so high on their list.  Great food, great service.  It's what I use as a bar for other restaurants, and honestly it isn't even fair.\n\nIn one sentence: Mesa Grill is the place to go for food orgasms."
0,"If Toby Keith really loves this place, he would fire the current chefs and hire new ones.  \n\nThe service was very nice but the food............bleh!  One of the worst BBQ Baby Back Ribs I've had.  It was dry and not much taste.  The Jumbo Fried Shrimps were so heavily battered, it tasted more like donut shrimps.  \n\nI've come to the conclusion that Harrah's gives away food vouchers because no one would actually come here to eat if they had to pay for it!  Well, certainly not me."
0,"i hardly write bad reviews.  just not my style i guess... but i just cannot get over our experience at raffles cafe.\n\nfive of us went down to raffles for breakfast friday morning.  the restaurant was not busy, so tell me... why did breakfast take an hour and 45 minutes?\n\ntime it took to get seated (and awkwardly shuffled around to different waiting areas by the hostess): 10 minutes.\n\ntime it took for us to get acknowledged by someone: 15 minutes.\n\ntime it took for that someone to get our waters: 10 minutes.\n\ntime it took for our actual server to come and take our orders after we got our waters: 10 minutes.\n\ntime it took for our food - all breakfast... EGGS, for god's sake - to come after we ordered: 45 minutes.  45 f-ing minutes!\n\ntime it took for us to eat of our mediocre, lukewarm, barely a step above denny's food:  5 minutes.  we were starving.  yet, that didnt make the food taste any better.\n\ntime it took for us to get our bill: 10 minutes.\n\n= 1 hour, 45 minutes.\n\nridiculous."
1,"Tao was so lame.  It was way too crowded, no room to dance or simply walk past.  I saw very few hot guys, mostly a bunch of corny ass dudes.  If you go, get extremely faded beforehand so you don't notice how lame it is when you walk in.  On the bright side, if you're a hot girl you'll get in free."
1,I was very disappointed base on all the good reviews. The food was ok ( baked potato was cold) I feel the dining room is poorly managed as most of the tables needed bussing which required us to wait 20 min. Service was very slow and had to ask multiple times for bread and water. Hate to say this but Outback is MUCH better. Will probably never return or recommend to friends
2,"Price was right. Cool concept but I like 5 guys better. What A Burger is my favorite burger, guess you could say I'm old school. In and out was busy and had good service but as for the burger's. A lot of hype."
4,Absolutely delicious. I have never had pita chips like these and quite honestly...I am spoiled now!  Everything we had was wonderful and we made sure to let the guy who runs the place know it!  Will definitely revisit!
2,"I had some drinks & pizza here on 6/28/12.\n\nI was here on a Thursday, and this place was PACKED & INSANE!  It was pretty much elbow-room only.  Not much privacy, and the atmosphere was very loud.  \n\nThe service was excellent, but the food was VERY expensive for what you are getting.  Thin-crust pizza was tasty, but very well-done & crispy/crunchy.  Some may like it this well-done, and some may not.\n\nThe bathrooms are VERY small (single person - Lock door behind you).  This absolutely DOES NOT go with the capacity at which the restaurant was at.  Expect a wait if you have to pee.\n\nI may or may not come back."
1,"The front desk girl a few different times wasn't friendly at all.  The food is good but portions are small.  If it weren't for the hostess that never smiles I would rate more stars.  Hostess should be welcoming , accommodating and friendly.  For they are the first person you see when you enter.    Great fried zucchini though !!"
3,"Jets is delicious. You will not find any pizza place in town that gives better pizza than Jets. As a frequent goer, I recommend the 8 corner pepperoni with cheese on the crust. Also, the barbecue chicken will not disappoint."
4,Had the Bun Cha Ha Noi. It was so GOOD!!! Must have this when u are here. I will come back :)
1,"Was very disappointed. We have frequented this restaurant before and decided to go for date night. Food came out way to fast and tasted like it was from old supply. Chicken was rubbery,meatballs not done,bacon dates tasted mushy. So sad we will not be coming back."
1,"I received free passes for the back row to this show, face value of just under $50. I would not pay that much to attend this show and sit in the front row.\n\nThe show has a few funny moments but overall it is dated and reminiscent of the humor from 90s sitcoms, discussing the differences between how men and women communicate and behave, connecting our current habits as inherited from our caveman ancestors.\n\nOverall the show itself was not particularly funny and most of the material did not seem new. As others have said, there are several awkward pauses and lulls in the set, almost as if they are built in for audience participation or applause, but unfortunately there was not much of that at the show I went to.\n\nThe set is very basic and the improv room itself dated with framed photos of 80s-90s comedians on the walls. While it was not entirely a waste of time, I'd definitely suggest finding a discount or comp passes rather than paying full price- I do not think the original cost was justified by the performance I saw."
1,"I'm an Enterprise e-plus platinum member and have rented from this location maybe 5 times. The good part is that you usually get a good choice of cars instead of just being handed a key and being restricted to one specific car.\n\nOn the other hand, most recently I was rented a car in which the tire pressures were apparently all low (3 at 27 psi and one at 25) on a Maxima which was low enough to set off the tire pressure warning light after about 4 miles of driving. I know these cars are churned through customers with little more than a quick wash with a mop/bucket and a vacuum between rentals, but for me to have to stop at a gas station, put quarters in an air machine, and maintain Enterprise's car is bullshit.\n\nAnd give me a break, a Maxima with cloth seats is really more of a full-size class like the old bodystyle Impala is considered currently, not a Premium as I had reserved and paid for. I was also offered a base model Mustang coupe, which once again, isn't a Premium class car, and sure as heck wasn't going to work with the amount of luggage we had.\n\nI'll rent here again, but it's only because Enterprise has my employer by the balls with cheap corporate rates."
1,"Not a fan. I visited here 4 times over a year ago. Thought the food was mediocre at best. The atmosphere was cool and the service OK. Not interested in returning. Have lots of other options. The atmosphere is unique and cool, but not enough to return."
2,Inexpensive.... been coming here for years and the bartenders are great. When u sit on the patio u feel like you're at a ranch. Some douche does happen here.... close enough to the border Of the Land Of the Lames.... but still pretty safe. Parties and grilling happen here often. Day drinking is a given
0,I dont understand how taco bell is still in business in AZ where there are hundreds of great mexican restaurants. Taco bell is garbage!
3,"Remedy's is one of those neighborhood bars with gambling that Vegas has so many of. Let's do this review in a pros & cons style based on 2 years of giving them our business. \n\nPros: \nEasy interstate access off I-515 or as some call it the 95. \nAmple parking. \nNice building on the outside. \nDark but nice on the inside. \nPlenty of HDTV's around the bar and strategically placed so you can watch pretty much anything that's on at the time. \nSeparate, glassed off non-smoking area if you want to eat without the smoke. \nDrinks: strong pours by knowledgeable bartenders who know their stuff. \nFood: from fish & chips to nachos they have a pretty nice range of offerings with something for almost everyone. And their sliders have been real kid pleasers around here. \nTHEY OFFER TAKEOUT WITHOUT ATTITUDE. Just walk in, go to the back of the bar and find a bartender and you'll have nicely wrapped bags of food in no time. \nOh and if they say 15 minutes, they mean 15. I like their consistency. \n\nCons: \nService can sometimes be slow. Sometimes...but it's rare. \nFood: I've had the occasional problem like soggy sweet potato fries, or cold onion rings, and I've had maybe 2 orders out of 50+ that had issues where I sent it back or complained. Again, 2 out of 50+. \nI did find a strand of hair on my sweet potato fries once. \nOn a bright day adjusting to how dark the place is can be a little rough. But it's a bar, so I really shouldn't say anything about it but I did anyway. \n\nAgain, I'm looking back over 2 years plus now as I write this and my family keeps asking for their food, and we keep going back. \n\n4 Stars. YMMV but for us Remedy's will be staying on our fail-safe food options list."
3,"Marquee is a hot mess, but a glamorous one =)\n\nThe lines to get into the club are ridiculous and look completely unorganized but the bouncers/ door guys know exactly what lines are for what. They make a chaotic scene look under controlled! \n\nThere isn't really a dress code. And that is sort of a disappointment. Some girls are in flats and leggings and guys are in tennis shoes and tee. \n\nNavigating through the club can be a challenge, I admit. The stairs are killers- yes. The dance floor gets too crowed and you feel like your in a can of sardines, yes. But those are things that can be overlooked. Haah. \n\nThe DJ and entertainers are great. The sound system is crazy. And the bartenders are good looking and nice."
0,"Believe the reviews. Think I'm finally done with this place. I usually just get brown rice & teriyaki chicken, so I'm typically spared by the fact that they're always out of everything. I always attributed it to the fact that they get a heavy lunch rush, and just don't handle it well.\n\nToday, i got there at 11:30 after working a very early morning, expecting piping hot pans of (relatively) fresh-looking food. To my amazement, it was the worst i've ever seen it here; every pan had barely 2 or 3 scoops of food, and it was all picked over with barely any meat in anything, with sauce burnt to the bottom of the pan. It immediately became apparent that they had just reheated last night's leftovers, and hadn't finished making new food for the day.\n\nAbsolutely appalling. Not that I should have high hope for a freaking Panda Express... but good grief guys."
1,"Stopped for breakfast while waiting for my connection in PHX. Food quality was really poor. Wilted fruit, soggy home fried and an undercooked egg. Would not recommend to a friend."
3,I went with my wife and two year old and the service was quick and friendly! I wold recommend this place to anyone who loves breakfast items as much a we do. Best pancakes!.
4,Incredible experience! The showcase is huge with a wide selection of great quality furniture at wholesale prices! The staff is very helpful and friendly. They immediately helped me find exactly what I was looking for and more! I will definitely be back to purchase more and I strongly recommend this place to anyone who is looking to find good quality furniture at amazing prices!!
1,"Nice Hotel but Bad Casino...\n\n-the gambling floor is really small.\n-they did not have food service at the pool but said they will soon, this was in March.\n-tried to upsell me a better view of the fountain for 35 more a night, I didnt bite. i got the back side of the airport...Pist.\n-for 20 bux more i could of stayed at Caesars Palace that weekend"
2,"Totally unimpressed it was Sat. afternoon my wife had an urge for In-N-Out, the closest one was Tempe,location. Burgers were dry, bun was dry and the fries even though I know they are hand cut fresh are still not as good as McDonalds. I won't be back soon for a Double double."
0,"This show was terrible!  I don't know what Cirque Du Soleil was thinking, or Aria!  This was supposedly the most expensive stage, and considered \""top secret\"" to even the builders of it, they had to scrap it's design a couple of times throughout it's construction, and for what?  Two lousy R&B/Pop singers who murder Elvis on the background, a total and complete lack of clasic \""Cirque Du Soleil\"" Acrobatics and the artistic quality of the make-up and costumes that was normally constant with CDS 'early' acts.  Bad singing, bad acting, actors weren't clever and interactive and had very bland outfits and hardly any makeup.  I'm so glad I didn't have to pay the normal price of $165.  I wouldn't have paid a dime!  I only gave it a star because it the tickets were free."
3,"Hey folks, this is the Bellagio Cafe in Las Vegas not Denny's in Podunkville, so it's going to be on the expensive side, but you do get what you pay for and what you don't!  What you don't get . . . ketchup in dirty refilled bottles, sticky maple syrup bottles, paper napkins, and the list goes on and on!\n\nWhat you do get is great atmosphere, delicious food and courteous service. Even while standing line (and there often is a long line), you get to enjoy the stunning seasonal display and fragrant smells of the Bellagio Conservatory. Our favorite spot to sit is in the clover-shaped 4-plex booth to the left when you walk up the ramp, facing the conservatory . . . what a view and you get some of the best people watching in Vegas!\n\nThe food is consistently delicious.  Over the years (most recently in early March 2012), we have tried just about everything on the breakfast and lunch menus. For breakfast, I highly recommend the Bellagio Classic Omelet or the Maryland Crab Cake Benedict.  I always ask for my eggs on the soft side and they have never failed me. I also like my hash browns well, almost burnt, and they for the most part, that's what I get. For lunch, try the Cobb. My husband swears by it!\n\nCoffee is top notch, and they will leave a carafe on your table. They have real cream or milk, not the faux stuff that comes in mini plastic cups. I adore the fact that when you order an iced tea, the ice cubes are actually made with the tea itself as well. \n\nWe used to love to linger in the cafe when they had Keno, but they have removed the game it seems from all MGM Mirage properties across the board. So sad! We really missed it on this trip!"
3,"During one hot spring day in Chinatown I was STARVING (as always, my metabolism  is ridiculous). Tired of my usual Thai Food fix and wanting to seek something new I find HSP on Yelp. \n\nInitial reaction: HOLYSH!T did this just open!? \n\nTurns out its located towards the end of the Chinatown Plaza extension on Wynn Rd and Spring Mountain. The lady working told me they've actually been opened for 5 years! I seriously felt like I have been living in a pineapple on the bottom of the sea. I bear crawl my hunger self to there and in front of me was a small shop with smallish quantities of various poke! it must be a good sign that there are small quantities of the poke to maintain the fish freshness. No old poke, yay! I'm not from Hawaii, an islander, or have lived anywhere with fresh off the coast fish, BUT usually I can taste fish funk. In my Shoyu Limu Tuna bowl I had no funk, only delicious fresh poke and warm rice sprinkled with black sesame seeds and only $8ish!\n\nExcited to come back and try more."
3,"Great show, but had great seats. I feel sorry for those in the balcony, as some of the magic is close-up....but this is a common problem with theater magic....to be expected. In fact, they do a whole routine about the intimacy of close-up magic that is projected on a big screen for those in the back of the audience, and the diversions created by the cameraman. That illusion was so excellent and to-the-point. Spoiler alert, spoiler alert ... how Teller became the audience member-videographer was amazing.\n\nPenn was his usual heavy-handed preachy and political...no wonder Teller is speechless...can't get a word in. But he's an atheist libertarian, and would expect nothing less from him.\n\nThe comedic aspects of the show are genuinely funny and at times unexpected, making them even better moments.\n\nIf you're gong to a magic show to be spellbound and tricked, this show's not for you. Although they have several cool tricks they don't explain, they do walk you through the process of being a huckster magician and psychic. No wonder other magicians hate them.\n\nAvoid the bar at the show, unless you like $16-20 drinks, $8 sodas, $6 water. Unless your an alcoholic, you can wait the 90mins to get your fix cheaper.\n\nDon't miss the meet and great after the show, especially with Teller. He'll actually chat with you...he speaks...and take a selfie with you. He takes the picture, and is a good photographer.\n\nThe show is a well produced Las Vegas show. Buy the closest tix you can afford, or get discounted vouchers on the Strip, show-up early at 7pm and ask for an upgrade...worked for me. Got 7th row seats for $62. Would highly recommend, and quasi-kid friendly. They do swear, but no more than kids hear on the playground."
0,"So this was my first and probably only time that I will be staying at a Aloft hotel chain.....\nThe hotel concept is based on competing with the entry level Motel 6 and lower end Best Westerns... But with a nice chic/edgy decor that is geared toward the younger crowd..college age or very young professionals..\n\nNot a bad concept but what kills this is the lack of lack of a proper checks and balances in the housekeeping/ maintenance department.\n\nI stayed at two different locations this past week....the Tempe one and the Airport Aloft. Both had issues with room cleanliness, not necessarily the maids fault as some issues were room damage that should of been fixed by management.\nService was hit and miss.... A...first day check in staff was ok...female bartender was friendly and gave us tips on were to go for St. Paddys day \n\nBut one guy working the desk (in his late 30's or early 40's) refused to re-magnetize our door key because none of us were listed on the reservation or the room...so after about 15 minutes of us making phone calls to get our buddy's brother on the phone we finally got our key magnetized....and he literally said \"" oh yea I do see your name on the reservation, not sure how I missed it\""!...\n\nOhhh and one female bartender actually had BALLs to ask where a shot glass went from the shot he bought me... As I was sitting in the lounge area while they played pool...he pointed in my direction and told her he bought it for me...she said ohhh..I don't want you walking away with it....I guess there is a shot glass stealing issue at the Aloft Tempe  location\n\nList of pros:\nFree wifi\nFree pool table in lobby\n free water bottles and coffee in room\nDecor was nice and appealing\nGood happy hour from 5-7...$2 drafts\nCons:\nBoth locations had stained carpets in room\nPillows are really small almost travel size\nRooms are on the small side \nAll three rooms and both locations had damaged walls from the desk chair\nVery little storage room \nComforters in two rooms were stained ...lack of a cover on the comforters means they have to wash the entire thing after each guest....which I highly doubt they do\nAnd the coupe de grace was a red stain on the bed sheets of king bed at the Tempe location..about the size of nickel and the 2nd stain the size of a 3 quarters put together in a triangle shape.\n\nThere was a group of us and one reservation was lost so two of us stayed one night at Airport location while the rest stayed at Tempe location.  Overall all 3 rooms had similar issues at two different locations so  either is. Chain issue or a Phoenix issue...."
1,"I've been here a few times because it's close to my job.  The lady that works in the front is really nice but the food is just alright.  I've never had a major complaint but today my food was not good.  I ordered shrimp fried rice for lunch and it's different, maybe a new cook or they change the oil.  It smells really good but has no taste whatsover.  Even after adding soy sauce and pepper it's unedible.  I'm so surprised because I love fried rice and who can mess that up.  Now I have to find something else to eat for lunch."
0,"Paris Las Vegas is by the far the worst hotel one could stay in LV.  I made reservations 6 weeks ago for a Red Premier Room for a special occasion (also booked a room for my wife's parents flying in) on the site and called in to verify and everything was supposed to be set.  I didn't receive the room I reserved weeks in advance, my wife's parents didn't receive the room reserved and while escalating this at the front desk, this french speaking agent had the audacity to tell a Fortune Technology Executive that I didn't know how to use the computer and made the reservations wrong even though I had an iphone, ipad and my own wireless access point and showed her what I ordered on the website (Paris sucks even further and does not even give free Internet service to its guests unless you pay $12.95/24hours).  I should get a full refund of my T&E and immediate termination of the agent that angrily and publicly berated my technological skills.  You should never run a hotel with such piss poor customer service. Gary Loveman actually runs a place like this?"
4,The best local place to get beer.  It has the feeling of NODA. I have never seen a better selection of cold quality craft beers.
4,"Before the Novocain had worn off today, I received an email from my dental hygienist with the following message:\n\nShauna,\n\nIt was nice to meet you today. I hope you recover well from the cleaning and treatment. Have a good day! \n\nNatalie\n\nAfter two years without dental insurance, and no means to visit their office, they remembered me and treated me just as courteously as if no time had passed. They explained that since I had come in on a Tuesday, I would be getting a different hygienist. Honestly, I don't remember my last hygienist but the gesture was meaningful nonetheless. As I bemoaned the gap in my teeth (hate it) Dr. Tim said, \""You have a great smile,\"" and he meant it. \n\nToday, I had three shots of Novocain and two hours of \""open wider\"" but I never felt rushed or pressured to get on to the next patient. We talked at length about my flossing habits and I was given an explanation of which floss is best for my particular bite. Dr. Tim is out of network on my insurance and I could not care less.\n\nYes, my tooth hurts and chewing is a bear but I sincerely believe Dr. Tim and his team care more about my teeth than I do. And I carry floss in my purse... \n\nIf you're looking for a new dentist, please check out Healthy Smiles. Even if he is not in your neighborhood, it is worth the drive.\n\n(PS: I'm generous on reviews but I feel strongly enough about this 5-star review to rethink previous generosities.)"
1,"I suppose when it's Gordon Ramsay's restaurant you expect more or better than average.\nLike everyone else I have watched his shows and he seems to be a passionate chef.\nThere was a 45 minute wait to get a table- that's fair it was a Friday night so we went and killed some time until our text message informed us the table was ready. The staff uniforms are RIDICULOUS, so blatantly inappropriate, ill fitting and unflattering. Please change them- what a joke they are. The umbrella girls at motorpsorts events are wearing more clothes than the poor girls working at BURGR.\nThe burgers took another 45 minutes to come out and they were okay but not great. My husband got the truffle fries with the truffle aioli, which frankly all just tasted like garlic and not much else. I cook for my family most nights so the burgers were not earth shatteringly good or something I couldn't whip up in 15 minutes. i just expected more.\nWell I did get more when the bill came $150 for 2 adults and 2 kids for a burger meal. \nWe won't go back to BURGR, but there certainly is a slew of Gordon Ramsay restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas. He seems to be a hard worker and he's making hay while the sun shines."
4,First time Daisho sushi. I love this place \n\nGood food and good Price. \n\nI will be buck !!!
3,"Magpie is a great little Pizzeria located on MaGuire just above fairmount\n\nTo begin their MagPie Bloody Caesar is amazing\nI started with their meatballs and Caesar Salad, again both were really good\n\nTheir Pizzas are HUGE 1 is enough for 2 people, the ingredients are fresh and delicious, I had Prosciutto it was delicious\n\nPrices are reasonable but space is limited so get there early or make reservations"
0,"This was my 2nd time eating here.  I ordered 3 tacos. Asada, chorizo, and al pastor. Bleh.\n\nAn hour later I am puking and have nasty foul diarrhea that lasted the entire night and well into the next day.\n\nNever ever again will I eat here.  \n\nI think I will call Health Dept or Food inspection.\n\nNEVER AGAIN."
0,"Service so poor, they would not even let me in. I came with 6 friends, 3 guys and 4 girls. Excellent ratio, no? We dressed to the nines, waited in line. \n\nGot near the front and I was stopped by a bouncer who searched my bag, and then told me that I was not allowed to go in because of my camera gear. It was just my SLR with some lenses and a flash. The bouncer granted entry to everyone else with cameras and smartphones, but not me. Maybe he was also a photography hobbyist and was simply jealous of my equipment? Maybe he was worried about me being a paparazzi, even though my gear was nowhere near paparazzi status and I was clearly here, dressed up, with my friends, to have a good time?\n\nIf you are going to have customers post photos of your venue on Yelp, they might as well be good photos. Now they can keep their bad photos and bad publicity. I'll keep my Tao Nightclub virginity."
3,Decided to give this place a 2nd chance since I was in the area & needed a hard wax Brazilian! And I must say it was pretty darn good! Really not painful at all for a Brazilian and super clean and speedy!
4,I have been with America First Credit Union since 1993 I believe they were Network Credit Union back then. I now use the Las Vegas Shadow Creek Smith's Branch They are the  Best and always helpful with all my banking needs. A-1 Operation.I wish I could give them 10 no 1000 stars.
2,"Doughnuts were hot, fresh and good. The reasoning behind the 3 stars is due to 1) the manager/ shift supervisor/ the person who rang us up came across as arrogant and unfriendly 2) the seating/eating area was dirty and we were 2 of 3 customers in the place 3) the place where they assemble the doughnuts was dirty as well. It was unappetizing. I will try it again. Hopefully I will go back to a clean & friendly environment."
0,Complete assholes. Nuff said
1,"Look up a review by Jennie M. She sings high praises for this place. I cannot say the same. I am a firm believer that one review or one bad day should be the only thing to base the value of a venue on. So to those ends and the countless positive reviews I will share my opinion without too much judgement.  Just a declaration of my experience the one day, the one time I tried it. By the time we went to find this place it was well know so there wasn't much secret but who can really keep secrets on the Internet?  The pizza was lacking flavor,  over cooked and bland.  There was little more personality than a prison lunch line and I left feeling it should have remained a secret. The experience did not live up to the hype.  Given the other reviews it might be worth giving them a second chance."
4,"So in love with this place I decided to have my husband's retirement party here on a Thursday night.  I tried to plan something out and then decided to just have everyone show up.  We ended up with 40+ people who had a blast playing games, listening to the band, drinking, eating and just hanging out.  Kids are allowed in until around 10 so it was nice to have them be able to attend.  THE perfect night!!"
2,"This is a NYC restaurant. That is a compliment and a complaint. There is no question the food is outstanding. Arguably the best in all of Charlotte and deserving of national acclaim. \n\nHere is my complaint. Have you ever dined somewhere that it spectacular and the place knows its spectacular? I have experienced this in NYC. Sort of like the honor is all mine and I should be grateful they have allowed me to dine there. Maybe it was just my experience, but there was just an air of pretentiousness. \n\nSecond. The place is way too small. This means they have to flip the tables quickly to turn a profit. I was there with a party of four. We ordered a bottle of wine and drinks. The beverages came and we had to order. We were not allowed to order our appetizers while we perused the entr\u00e9e menu drank and chatted. Nope we had to order appetizers and entrees together. The waitress saw the incredulous look on my face and explained that the entrees take a while. \n\nWell the entrees didn't take long. Sorry but after dropping over $250 I don't think I should rushed. I worked in the restaurant industry. I know that people \""park\"" themselves at their table. Trust me that was not what we did. This was an assembly line chain restaurant experience. Get'em in and get'em out. \n\nI am glad I went an experienced Chef Moffet's food. He is incredible. He needs some help on the front end. I wouldn't go back. Jim Noble restaurants are much better run and the food is on the same level."
4,"Yes this is a local dive bar. However, it is quite good in the food dept.as well.    Came here last night for a quick dinner. Quite a lot to choose from on the menu.    My girlfriend was even able to get hot green Tea,and you would not expect that would you!    We both opted for sandwiches.  Very good, they subsitute without a problem. Our waiter was very good and our food was hot.                                                           They have a different menu speical every day of the week.    Lots of pluses here. They have 14 TV's all with differnet channels going.                        So you can't say you couldn't find anything to watch.    They have resone all the boots so they are nice and comfortable. Bathrooms are claen. Lots of  parking in the lot.....We like it!"
3,"Our first time here after a long but great day at the ball park.  A little bit of a wait since the patio was closed for a private party.  Totally worth the wait.  We were seated in the bar area and were warned it would be tight.  Chips and not-salsa-but sauce were darn good.  Margaritas awfully tasty.  He had the #5 3 shredded beef enchiladas and I had the #26 3 fish enchiladas. Very, very good.  We liked it not just for what it is but also because of what it isn't.  Is great food with authentic taste; isn't food slathered in sauce & cheese."
4,"We r from chicago and came to khyber halal after reading positive reviews on yelp. The restaurant is charming, quaint, and well - decorated with authentic afghani decor and pieces, also very clean. The owner/head chef Fahima greeted us and was our server. She was incredibly pleasant and gave us great recommendations. She discussed that she tries to use organic ingredients and tries to make dishes healthy for her customers. All of her meat entrees are halal.\n\nOur first visit we had beef samosa and shami kabob for appetizers. Each came with fresh green chutney and tasted as if she had just freshly hand made the dough, meat, and chutney. We ate afghani dishes including kabli pulao and uzbek pulao, both spectacular. The helpings of rice are heaping, and you'll definitely have leftovers. Thr prices are very reasonable.\n\nSince our visit, my family reminisced about the delicious taste of her food every meal in phoenix, nothing compared. We came back and tried her pakistani dishes, equally delicious! Her naan is so plump and tastes made in a tandoor.  This place is always crowded and filled with a diverse crowd.  Mango lassi is perfect after a morning hike. Dessert including phirni and baklawa taste homemade.\n\nWe will probably b back again during our vacation, but wanted to post this since I am truly in love with this place. The owner Fahima is incredibly talented and will probably b known as a great chef in the near future.  \n\nIf you are in phoenix, definitely visit this place, your taste buds will not forget it!"
1,"we had 20 chicken wings and the prime rib dinner with a sprite for ~20 on a friday night (3am).\n\n- chicken wings are a bit oily. after a few, it becomes hard to eat. oil overwhelms the flavor. medium taste like regular fried chicken without sauce. \n- 10 wings for 2.50. can only get them 10 at a time. 25 cents only for owl club members you have to get a drink to get it also.\n- prime rib was a bit rubbery and cold. mash potatoes were pretty good. green beans were a bit disgusting, tasted like it came out from a can. \n- friendly and fast service."
1,"First of all you can't beat the view of the lake and the atmosphere, very romantic and peaceful if you sit outside. We went there Saturday night, they had misters outside which were nice but they soaked my husband cause they were on so high facing in his direction. Our table ordered a ton of small plates. Honestly, nothing was amazing. I wouldn't go back because there wasn't much flavor, the staff wasn't friendly either. Good drink selection so maybe it would be a nice place to have a drink and a desert. We spent about $200 for small plates and drinks. We ordered two different types of sliders, peppers, empanada, truffle mac and cheese, bacon dates, spicy tenders and spicy fries and some salads. We usually love tapas but not here."
2,It was ok.  Had better
0,"Dinner was poor service, bad food and too expensive.  Good location for happy hour only."
2,The food was good.  Had the filet mignon egg sliders and fries for lunch.  \n\nService was a bit rushed and not overly friendly.
2,"This is  a frustrating hotel, because so much of it is \""almost, but not quite.\""\n\nThe renovation is reasonably stylish... but the rooms are badly laid out, with no power anywhere near the desk.\n\nThe bathrooms are cool-looking... but there's no place to hang a wash cloth in the shower, and the tiny little shower caddy can't hold travel-sized bottles of toiletries, including the ones they supply.\n\nThe Wifi is fast and reliable... and expensive.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty good... and unofficially closes for a private party for the bartender's friends at 9:30, when it is supposed to be open until 10.\n\nThe north tower has four fast elevators... two of which are out of service.\n\nIt's about a six block walk to anything in Uptown from here... but, hey, exercise!\n\nThe staff is helpful and friendly... to a point, but that point comes when you ask for anything that is even slightly outside of standard, and you are met with a varying degree of blank to cold stare.\n\nIt feels like they want to be a San Francisco boutique hotel (complete with attitude), but they just don't have the budget or chops to do so. If you are paying a convention or discounted rate (I was paying $99/night), it's not terrible value for money. More than that, though, and you have better options."
4,"I'm used to gun stores that are ghetto as hell - but American Shooters on Arville provide the consumer a clean, friendly, and well-inventoried show-floor. I've purchased several firearms from this location and have always received prompt and knowledgeable service. The prices are usually higher than most local retailers - but the selection of firearms and accessories are hard to beat. I have no issues paying more for the service and the well-kept environment.\n\nThey provide LE discounts that extend to the EMT/Security fields as well, so good stuff there. I work part-time for an armed security company, and it's awesome to have a one stop shop location for uniforms (with tailoring services), firearms (with associated discounts), and accessories under one roof. It's a life saver when you need to get stuff together at the last minute for a trade-show or on-call job.\n\nThey have a couple of ranges open for the general public - usual tourist trap on the weekends. Decent pricing and selection for those looking to try their hand at that full-auto SMG. Classes range from the usual CCW courses to the more interesting Zombie Eradication Response Team stuff. Braaaiiins!"
4,I've eaten here 5 times and the service has been friendly and prompt.  Food is consistently good at breakfast.   This is my first lunch meal.  Also good but I think breakfast is better.   (Hence the name!).  Strongly recommended!
3,"Finally got my Sheltie the other day; trip to PetSmart was unavoidable due to the essentials I needed to get that couldn't wait for online purchase. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised! I'd heard things about the prices - but  apparently there was some sort of sale going on and I was able to gather a plethora of puppy goodies for not a lot of dough. Everything seemed to be one sale! My puppy, needless to say, was very happy with me.\n\nMy one real qualm with this place was that we needed a dog tag, paid for a dog tag, and when we stuck it in the machine for the engraving, it came with a mandatory Petsmart logo. Sure, it may be genius advertising in disguise, but the idea that I'm paying the same thing I would online and Petsmart gets to sneak in a bit of free advertising makes me all snarly, especially when I'm subjecting my new beloved pet to be the billboard. Low blow, Petsmart; low blow.\n\nAside from that, I loved the product selection and the employees were friendly and very helpful. I also kinda dug the pet classes they held here, although I would love to see something more communal and less profit-based in the downtown Phoenix vicinity. Definitely go when they're having their sales; the prices for dog toys had been marked from $7-9 bucks per toy down to $2-4 bucks, and that in my book, is pretty OK."
3,"I happened in to this stylish, fairly small fast casual place today, where they have lots of booths (Yeah booths!), an attractive, colorful menu featuring their excellent selection of food at reasonable prices, a nice salsa bar, & super friendly service!\n\nI ordered Tortilla Soup, & an Asada Torta.  Pretty soon my \""small\"" soup arrived.  It came in a REAL (not styrofoam!) bowl, with a REAL metal spoon!  Can you imagine?  It was chock full of chicken, avocado, other goodies, & of course, tortilla strips.  It was DELICIOUS, & just a small taco with it would have added up to a full meal!  \n\nSoon after, my torta arrived...  good sized, tasty, & accompanied by a big side of hot, fresh, crispy french fries (that I didn't expect).  Even though they had lots of customers, staff members found the time to check on me both after I started on the soup, & on the torta, to be sure I was happy with everything.  (Yes!)\n\nNow for me, the torta wasn't quite a match in taste for the best ones at Los Reyes & Tortas Paquime, but I DO like this place & want to come back!"
2,"My husband and I would give three stars to SSE. Overall, the atmosphere is pleasant. We enjoy reading names and addresses on many envelopes under the glass on the table. The quality of food would deserve four stars had we not ordered French toast. The dish came in a lovely decoration of three baguettes, fresh strawberries and blueberries. However, the baguettes were too hard. I found it very difficult to cut them in pieces and more difficult to chew every piece of them. I couldn't finish them and left one piece on the plate without feeling regret of not asking for a box. My husband got the Trio and he loved the chocolate chip pancakes. So our suggestion is that ask before you order French toast and avoid it if it's made from baguettes."
4,Every time we come the service is prompt and courteous.  We had Nicole E again as our server and she is phenomenal.  Super nice and checks on you just enough.
4,"\""Super Delicious!!!\""\n\nThis restaurant is located in the Venetian Hotel. The ambiance is exquisite and the food is out of this world. The service is top of the line. If you are looking for a place that serves excellent Italian food where you don't have to dress up (jackets for men) then this is the place for you. Both my husband and I will definitely return. \n\n\nVisited July 2013"
4,"I have been seeing Dr. Weisner for various ailments since May of 2000.  He has helped me recover from a serious car injury, and allowed me lead an active an healthy lifestyle.  \n\nAlways very professional and willing to spend time with you.  Great staff as well!"
1,"I got a gift card for Christmas for this place. Never even heard of it before but I also don't eat at a lot of chain restaurants either. I went New Year's Eve to try it out. I am a single guy and the place was super busy so I chose a seat at the bar. The bar was busy but started to clear as soon as I sat down. It became very apparent very quickly that there was a single person working the bar. She was also the one making drinks for the rest of the restaurant. New Year's Eve is typically a drinking holiday so the short staffing was perplexing. After my area was cleared she asked for my drink order and I requested a menu. It was close to 10 minutes before the bartender asked for my order. I order the filet and lobster tail.  About 10 minutes later, a young lady delivered my entree to me; however, I had not received my salad yet. I sent it back and my salad was delivered about 2 minutes later. I was never offered bread so I asked a young man cleaning glasses at the bar if I could have some bread. He quickly returned with a loaf. The bleu cheese dressing is too sweet and was really heavy on the salad. When the entree arrived it looked fine but I did ask the server if it was a fresh meal or left over from the first delivery. The filet was very good, the risotto was fine, and the lobster tail was cooked fine too. It is a little small and the seasoning on it could be left off. Overall the meal was average to decent but the service was horrible. I never was asked how the meal tasted or apologized to for the mishap. I understand the busy-ness that was going on, but it had died down quite a bit by the time I sat down. As a single person who also doesn't drink alcohol, I am accustomed to not always getting doted on by servers since my tab may not always generate the biggest tips. But even just a little acknowledgment to me would've gone a long way. Then to my surprise, as I looked at my bill, I was discounted 25%. I am assuming it was for the messed up order?? But no one said anything to me about that either. Well, I am grateful for the attempt to make up for it, but not sure I'll be back anytime soon."
2,"This place is pretty secluded. If you don't know the neighborhood you'd probably never find it. Luckily I was on a food tour. Its a small convenient store with beer, wine, and other random goodies like yellow stone ground grits (yes I bought some). It has a deli counter and you can create your own sandwich. The owners are pretty cool people too! Look it up and stop in!"
3,"The food here is second to none. There were four of us, so we had a wide variety of small plates. All of it was grand. Some of it, like the foie gras, was a little rich for my taste, but quality nonetheless. We had two desserts (cheesecake and creme brulee), neither of which was anything to write home (or Yelp) about. Also, the wine pours are either done by someone with poor depth perception or possibly Japan has a different definition of a glass of wine, as they were stingy with the grape juice. With as popular as this place is (reservations are a must), I am not sure why they do not open a larger location, as the current one is cramped and not very inviting. The service was adequte, but not overly nice or accommodating. Focus on the small plates, and keep the rest in the periphery."
2,"Had lunch here this week and last week.  This is a new place and still is having some growing pains with the waitstaff but the food is super!  I was here this past Tuesday and saw the waitress bring out our order and take it to two other tables and asked those tables what they ordered before she came to ours *sigh*.  I have had the Southern Fried chicken salad and the Blackened Chicken Salad, both were good.  The avacado on Blackened Chicken salad was too ripe (brown spots and stuff) - it was a little weird.  But my friend had the special last week and it was fantastic and cheap.  It was $7.95 for a fantastic chicken breast over unreal 'smashed potatoes'.  My friend Tuesday got the wrap special which he said was excellent but in the description the waitress neglected to tell him there was bacon on the wrap and he is Muslim so we had to pick it out but other than that he said it was awesome.  The fries that came with the wrap are also VERY good.  So I will keep going here and may even try it for a work breakfast!!"
2,"I went with a group on saturday to take advantage of their \""Super Saturday\"" promotion. 50% off all food for our table if we dined between 7-9 and mentioned super saturday when making the reservation. Give it a try!!\n\nAtmosphere: Sleek...modern... fun.. I really loved the feel of this place. The black \""leather\"" booths were comfy.\n\nDrinks: First round was awesome. Yummy martinis that were perfectly crafted. 2nd round came from a different bartender. They all sucked. Paying $10 a pop for inconsistent drinks is a bummer!\n\nFood: calamari was excellent. Crisp and a great portion size. Foccacia on the table was warm and delish. My ahi tuna salad was gross unfortunately. The tuna wasn't fresh.. it wasn't seasoned.. it was just bland chewy mush on my plate. The salad came dressed (when I asked for dressing on the side). The plate wasn't put together particularly well.... just not a great salad (especially compared to the delish ahi crunch salad at Yardhouse!!). My fiance was happy (but not super excited) about his chicken fetticuine. \n\nOverall not a *bad* experience, but not great. I'd try them again, but I'm in no rush at this point."
2,"It's a barber shop, man style. Complete with swirling barber pole out front. Wall-to-wall flat panels showing ESPN in HD, and other sports. Was great to see part of the world series tonight surrounded by gangsta types all getting their fades and lines. All I needed was the beer and dogs. Well maybe not. That wouldn't have gone so good with the little bits of hair flying all over as the clippers buzzed away.\n\nSeriously, get your bling on. Need help? Danny's's got it for ya."
3,"I've always seen signs for this buffet, but since it's a bit off the strip, it was always a bit inconvenient for us.  We decided to give it a try this time, and it wasn't bad at all.  \n\nWhen we first got there, the line looked a bit intimidating.  It went out the door, looped around the escalators, and down a bit more.  We stood in line and watched the Rio bartenders do tricks, so the wait actually wasn't too bad.  It went by pretty quickly, and we were seated quite promptly.  \n\nThey had a decent array of choices - from Asian to Cajun, crustaceans to barbecue.  My favorites were - of course - the crab legs and shrimp.  Those two alone made me a very happy camper.  The legs were NOT SALTED!!  Most buffets in Vegas salt their crab legs to preserve them.. but not here!  :D  Big kudos for that!  They were easy to crack, and super sweet and juicy.  I also really enjoyed the New England clam chowder.. yummy!!  \n\nAnother portion I really look forward to at buffets are the desserts.  Sadly, I was not impressed.  However, they did have gelato though!  For some reason, I was loving the cantaloupe and honeydews way more!  The strawberries were delicious too - add the chocolate syrup and you have a chocolate fondue!!   \n\nI don't know if I'd come back necessarily.. it is a bit inconvenient as I've said before.. but definitely enjoyed it while I was there!"
2,"I hadn't been to Pedro's in years, since I lived in the area. It was never one of my favorite places in Madison, but I did enjoy it occasionally. I'm generally underwhelmed by the Americanized Mexican places that dot maps of most towns.\n\nHaving just returned from a trip to Seattle and wanting to sit down in an air conditioned building and have some okay food, my dad recommended Pedro's. It seemed like a fine option at the time. Not terribly adventurous, but I just had my adventure and I had to accommodate my dad's less-than-thrill-seeking palette.\n\nThe salsa was actually better yesterday than I ever remember it being in the past. It was very thick and tomato-ey, with just a tiny hint of kick. I'd have preferred it to be a bit hotter, myself, but again, being with the parental unit meant keeping to something a bit more tame.\n\nI had the asada burrito, and my dad had the chili burrito. Mine was fine; long strips of pepper and onion mixed in with some cubed steak (actually, I would recommend cutting the veggies to about half their length...they're too easy to pull completely out of the tortilla when you go to get a bite). I had a side of refried beans and rice; these were obviously simple sizes for the cooks because they were clearly just microwaved. It was easy to tell because the rice was pretty dry. The chili burrito was exactly what my dad was hoping for, so there's that.\n\nAll in all, if you know what you're in for it's very standard American-Mexican fare. \n\nAs an aside, the previous time I was here a few years ago they had this fantastically gay waiter named Jimmy. He was outrageously friendly and chatty and actually sat down at our booth with us to chat about Plan B and the LGBT scene in Madison. It was a fun time!"
0,"A 40 mile round trip drive only to be told by the snotty butcher that you can only buy stuff that is listed on their web site as for sale if you're on \""The List\""?  Yeah, no thanks. I'll just keep going to Hobe Meats and ordering stuff online.\n\nIf you do decide to bother with this place, call ahead. Just because they have it on their web site with a price next to it apparently doesn't mean it's actually for sale.  While calling, also ask how to get put on \""The List\"", because that info isn't on their site either."
0,"It took me a while thinking about write this review.\nI'm crazy with sushi-mon. My husband always call me a sushi monster !!\n\nI usually go to sushi mon around 2-3 times a month for at least 2 years. When I heard they changed the owner I wasn't care but somehow the feeling of enjoyment has changed too!\nThe food is 4 stars for me.\n\nThe new upgraded design was nice but the service is getting worst every time I go there. \n\nI've always enjoying the service and conversation with couple Thai ladies and Yuki ( I think that was her name ) They are seem very polite, give us attentions and make the place feel welcome, But lately I haven't seen them much ( maybe my schedule have changed ) I went there on Thursday night (3/13/14) it was 3 groups of people only and I still received a shitty service from them!\n \nThe waitress were so MEAN!! For some reason which is I do not understand at all. We are a customer who going to give you tips and pay for what we eat!  We are not begging you for a free food!!! There were No smile No Hello No goodbye  No thank you!!! Just a simple unhappy face like this :( \nWhen I ordered she do not give me and signal that she got it just walk away. When she brought the food she just drop it next to me not even in front of me then walk away. \nWe have to waved to get their attention. It was horrible. \n\nWe are hoping that the service somehow get better. Maybe I'll go back maybe I won't."
4,"I had a great experience at Benihana last night. My in-laws took me there for my birthday--seriously does anyone go to Benihana for anything other than their birthday? The food was great and our chef, Jeremy, put on a great show though I did notice some of the other teppanyaki cooks were a bit more animated.\n\nThe onion soup, salad and shrimp appetizer were as good as ever and the signature Mai Tai in a Buddha mug was delicious. I ordered the Splash 'N Meadow and asked for my meat to be cooked medium rare. It was the perfect texture and temperature. The shrimp were great, too. My husband had the mango shrimp and really liked them though he did mention the sauce was a bit sweeter than he'd anticipated. \n\nThe staff was really great and made sure we all had constant refills. Our server was very attentive and helpful when ordering. Go here for your next birthday but make sure you go online and get the free birthday coupon first."
4,"I always defend british food when it comes to the myth about how bad it is. But regarding the bread: Jesus it's the worst!\nIt didn't took me long to realise why people toast just every single slice: There is just no other option as every bread is a weird foam and you can reduce the size of it to 1/10 just by squeezing it in one hand. The Rye-bread you can buy in a supermarket needs to be toasted as well (NEEDS) otherwise it moulders into a million pieces before you had the chance to spread butter on it to at least stick it together. My bread nightmare came true in Great Britain!\n\nSo thank you FALKO to save my life with a variety of healthy, tasty bread! They have it all here: Black, Rye, Spelt, Multi-grain...etc... Finally my teeth have something to do again and I don't feel like an old woman who has to eat crustless bread that melts in your mouth. \n\nI do like the cakes a lot as well. Like Murphy said the fruit tarts are heavenly. Have it with cream and if you sit in order hot chocolate in addition. This place is supposed to have a really good 'Baumkuchen', which I never tried before as it reminds too much of christmas season but I am sure I am gonna take my favourite Schnauzer and his owner to an advent treat. One has to get over the smell of spilt milk though!\nBut I am sure we'll be there before that time and enjoy a nice breakfast!"
3,"This is a really interesting place in Scottsdale. My friend was \""chef for a night,\""  (she provided recipes, but the main chef still cooked) so I have not been on a regular night. However, the chef seemed really cool and the meal I had there was delicious! Everything was portioned just right, and the spices and oils were not too overwhelming but delicious enough. \n\nThe waitress we had the night I went wasn't the friendliest. I would say that's a definite negative. Also the bathroom kind of stunk as well."
4,"My girlfriend and I wanted a weekend getaway.  We found the Royal Palms Resort and gave it a try.  It was a little pricey, but it was well worth it for the atmosphere and experience.  We loved the Hacienda feel of the property and enjoyed the time at the pool.  No rowdy kids were to be seen and everyone was enjoying the sun and quiet.  The whole evening was quiet.\n\nThe room we stayed in was also amazing!  It consisted of a tile shower and shutters in front of the bath tub.  It was fun to get away for a weekend.  We even ate at TCooks restaurant.  The food was expensive but we enjoyed being pampered like royalty.  Oh and the drinks we just as great!\n\nI would go back to the Royal Palms anytime.  Definitely recommend it!"
0,"I would give negative stars if possible. Absolute worst experience ever. I contacted Wardley real estate because I found a house I was interested in while browsing on realtors.com. I contacted the listing agent.  And was linked up with the worst realtor ever Greg Hicks. He was the most unprofessional agent I have had to deal with. Not once during the Three month period of my short sale did he contact me to update me on anything. I had to call him and when I did he never had an answer for me he always said \"" I'm going to have to ask the selling agent, I'll get back to you\"" but he never would. So I finally began contacting the selling agent Jennifer hill who is the 2nd worst realtor ever!. She was very unresponsive never returning my messages. Finally when my purchase agreement expired I quickly canceled my agreement a requested my earnest deposit back which took them weeks to even get them to get the owner to sign (BS).  They gave me the run around constantly and were full of it. If I ever see a property listed under Wardley I will run the other way. Oh ...and Jeff Sommers was of no assistant as well. Wardley real estate is a complete fail."
1,"The food is fine - it's bagels for crying out loud! The problem here is two-fold: 1) the layout of the place is bad, causing you to queue in the dining area and then wait for your food while you're in the way of customers coming in, going out or getting beverages; 2) as others state - the service is horrible!\n\nConvenient but poor service."
3,"I've done a few haunted tours and this was one of the best. A 3 hour tour around Vegas is worth the $50. Seeing where Tupac was shot, stopping to see where some pioneers were murdered and the all the hotel horror stories were great. The seance was cheesy but it was still entertaining. That and the people who thought it was real. C'mon people. It's worth the time and money if you like this type of entertainment."
3,"Muy bueno!  Here's a hidden treasure in the old Garfield barrio.  It's located right next to Garfield Elementary School, so if you passed the school, you went too far.  \n\nWhen you go in, it's like going into someone's house and ordering from their kitchen.  This place is a total hole-in-the-wall.  Also important to note that it is a cash-only establishment.\n\nThey only serve burritos & chimichangas NO TACOS.  Their burritos are extremely runny but extremely yummy and will literally explode in your mouth.  I recommend ordering a dozen tortillas on your way out.  \n\nCheck out Rito's when you're feeling adventurous and wanna hang out the locals in the barrio."
3,"Years ago as a kid growing up in Musselburgh, one of the challenges thrown down in front of you would be - which ice cream do you like more, Luca's or Di Rollo's?\n\nHands down, my response for the past 25 *cough cough* years has been Luca's. I wouldn't even sniff in the direction of Di Rollo's. But... you know what, time can change the old taste buds, and I can definitely say now that I have more than a little love for Di Rollo. It tastes creamier, I like the different flavours (raspberry ripple for the win! As is coconut). So now I tend to walk on the wild side, my opinions change, and I go against the tide of Luca's fans. \n\nNom."
3,"I'd put a 4.5 star rating if it was available.\n\nThe knocked off half star would be because out of 5 visits or more, one time the pecan crusted trout came out under cooked and bland. I did arrive a bit late and I believe the kitchen was trying to close. I don't feel like a 945pm arrival time for 1030pm closing is that bad. maybe they were trying to close early due to a slow turn out.\n\nEvery item I've had here is yummy. Yesterday I came here and got the $36 alaskan king crab legs. They were very yummy (not the best I've had, but a damn steal for that price!)\n\nThe ambiance is great for a date.\n\nSome wet naps would of been really nice after the crab legs, but oh well, i don't knock off points there.\n\nI love the arnold palmer. I think the lemonade is their restaurant recipe, and it really gives a great after taste with the arnold palmer."
0,"Last night I went to the Benihana in Chandler for my birthday. It was the worst experience I have ever had a Benihana and I felt as if I had to write in. It wasn't my first visit, I have been there many many many times. I have a group of friends and we all go when its our birthday. We fill up a table each time. Last year my sister had a baby and as such we've had to adjust the time we normally go. I made a reservation for 5:15pm so she could come and it wouldn't interrupt my 1 year old nephews routine (and he would be in good spirits because as much as I love him I know that kids are emotional sometimes). All 6 people in our party left work early so we would all be on time. My sister and brother in law were waiting in the bar when I got to the restaurant. They had been there since 5 and the bar was empty expect for two tables.  They hadn't even been greeted by the bar tender for the 10 minutes they had been there before me. I checked in with the hostess at 5:15pm and she said it would be a few minutes so I went to the bar to order drinks. After about 10 minutes of being ignored by the bartender, I finally caught her attention and she snapped at me \""I'm the only one here in the bar, I'll help you when I can!\"".  Finally able to get a drink, we were starting to wonder how much longer for the table. At 5:35,  with the incredibly rude hostess, in an almost completely EMPTY restaurant, we finally walked back up and asked how much longer we would be waiting. The two girls had been mainly ignoring the guests and talking to each other and the lone male host. They weren't smiling, or friendly, or nice in any way shape or form. We were told ,rudely, that it would be another 5 minutes. 15 minutes after that, with my nephew getting antsy, I walked up and said that we need a table (in the now still half empty restaurant and full lobby). She said they would be sitting us 'right now'. I verified that it was in fact 'right now, right now, not right now in another 15 minutes.' And she said yes. My two sisters had walked outside to keep my nephew busy and I brought her back inside, and I pulled our other 3 people from the bar (who had been buying drinks and appetizers). We stood waiting in the lobby another 10 minutes. A full 50 minutes after we had checked in on time we were finally shown to our table. Where our waitress asked if this was our first visit. We told her that we were old pros but she still felt it necessary to go over the ENTIRE menu with us and ignored us trying to tell her that we even knew what we wanted to order. We wanted to get our order in so my sister could actually eat dinner before she had to leave since it had taken us SO long to be seated. The restaurant wasn't full at all and yet the waitresses service was still so slow and she ignored us so often that we ended up stacking our own used dishes up off to the side. She didn't even refill our drinks. My sister had to leave without even eating her meal. Her husband stayed behind to bring it home for her. We finally had to flag our waitress down for our checks and she forgot to use my coupon so we had to flag her down again. We gave her our cards and she forgot to run one of them so we had to flag her down again to run it.  \n\nI have a lot of sympathy for service (especially during the holiday season) but it was the attitude of the hostesses and the lack of involvement from the manager that really upsets me. The manager (who kept walking by the hostess desk) didn't bother to talk to the girls who weren't seating people in a restaurant that was empty! The reason we made such early reservations was so that my sister and my nephew could have dinner with us. I know that my group and I have decided to not go to Benihana's anymore after last night. Had it been only one person with a bad attitude, we would have absolutely been forgiving but this has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I won't be going back.\n\n**Update in response to the company contacting me, I had actually emailed their customer service first. But didn't hear anything back. It appears that Yelp is monitored more often than the customer service email?"
1,Hooters restaurant is like it is everywhere.  Crap.  The ladies had no hooters themselves.  The food is never great.  The hotel room was not great had an iron burn on the carpet rooms need to be updated and they charge u for drinks when your gambling.  Ok if you can get the room really really cheap
4,"Great food, fun atmosphere, and the service is excellent! Great for a special occasion, just don't forget to come hungry."
4,"Love this food, and the staff is really friendly. Great prices. Will definitely come here again."
1,"Je sais que beaucoup diront que ce restaurant est g\u00e9nial, super, exceptionnel et beaucoup d'autres superlatifs encore. D'ailleurs, j'avoue volontiers qu'il a en effet beaucoup de choses pour lui : les mets y sont raffin\u00e9s, originaux et savoureux. On y sent une v\u00e9ritable recherche de la part du chef et c'est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able pour les papilles. Le d\u00e9cor est cosy et chic, ce qui est id\u00e9al pour une soir\u00e9e en amoureux. Et pourtant... La soir\u00e9e que nous y avons pass\u00e9e ne nous a pas laiss\u00e9 un souvenir imp\u00e9rissable. Nous \u00e9tions plac\u00e9s dans un couloir de vent, en plein dans le passage des serveuses et tellement coll\u00e9s \u00e0 la table d'\u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 que chaque fois que le monsieur se levait, il bousculait notre table... Le service \u00e9tait moyen, la note \u00e9lev\u00e9e et cerise sur le g\u00e2teau, nous n'avions pas not\u00e9 que le restaurant est un \u00ab Apportez votre vin \u00bb et nous sommes retrouv\u00e9s sans vin pour accompagner nos plats!  Ce qui vu leur qualit\u00e9, \u00e9tait vraiment dommage. Pour les moins fain\u00e9ants que nous, poussez au moins jusqu'\u00e0 la SAQ de St-Denis pour prendre de quoi arroser tout \u00e7a, et vous d\u00e9tendre un peu. \u00c7a vous aidera \u00e0 dig\u00e9rer la douloureuse!"
0,You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.  The bar us hideously overpriced.\n\nWant a sode in the middle of the night?  Gotta buy it from the gift store before it closes.  1 coke = $300.  \n\nI will NEVER be back.
2,"When in Vegas you gotta go to see a topless show, if its vampires, or french caberate, pick one and go see it. We got compted tix to see this show, it didn't suck, but it wasn't cirque de soliel obviously. \n\nLuckily no one really had lines, it was all music. Good thing. Yes they were dancing, topless. yes it was amusing and entertaining. yes they had some acrobatics thrown in there. They even had a few magic tricks. Yes i was amused. No this show didn't suck.\n\nSee there is something at the stratosphere worth seeing. Yes there are dudes in this show. *gasp* I know in a topless show they have the nerve to have guys in there?! Oh relax! there's 3 guys in there, and yes two of them had to be there. The third one was just singing, so eh. How else do you expect to do acrobatics in the air without at least one guy? Seriously now.\n\nOverall it was pretty good. Its not your average seating in a theatre, more like tables,chairs and booths."
4,"My husband and were driving from Chicago to Madison for a concert and were looking for an inexpensive place to spend the night. Not only was the Ruby Marie the least expensive hotel within walking distance of the Majestic Theatre, but it had a charming atmosphere, everyone was friendly, and we got two complimentary drinks to the adjacent bar and two free breakfast entrees and beverages at the neighboring restaurant. Definitely the best deal in town. My only complaint was that the radiator was making loud rattling noises (if it wasn't the radiator, then it was something outside). However, I definitely plan to stay here again the next time we're in town."
4,I gotta give them 5 stars.  I love the old house ambiance and the friendly service.  My Italian pasty was excellent and enough for two meals.  They have a great beer selection.  Be sure to enjoy their patio when the weather is nice.
1,"THE GREAT:\n \nThe slaw was great! Sweet, probably had some mango and pineapple in it. If you do visit, do yourself a favor and get some slaw. Yes even if you don't like slaw. It's that good.\n\nThe salsa was really good with juicy canned tomatoes, fresh onions, lime juice, and cilantro. \n\nThe chimi was good, maybe overloaded on beans and rice. But what made it good was the sour cream, lettuce, pico, and guacamole. \n\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD:\n\nFish tacos were so-so and the menu said it came with the excellent slaw, but I had to ask the manager for it when he walked around and asked if everything was ok.\n\nI didn't like the black beans at all because they had some meat, maybe pork in them. Wish they would specify that stuff on the menu.\n\nThe secret to good margaritas is fresh lime juice, simple syrup, and tequila. They don't know the secret. It was only sour mix and tequila.\n\n\n\nTHE DOWNRIGHT TERRIBLE:\n\nSlow poor service. Thankfully the guy in the blue dress shirt, likely the manager made a round on us, and after waiting at the end of the meal, I walked to him and gave him my credit card and asked if he could ring us up. Our waitress was slow to take our order and then disappeared. I saw the hostess cross hatch a 5 by her name as she seated us. Apparently 5 tables was just too much for her. \n\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThey did offer and few unusual drinks and dishes. There is some potential here, but It's not even in the same galaxy as Cantina 1511, for example. \n\nPerhaps I will revise the star rating after my next visit. I at least know what to avoid next time."
4,Hot Shot Vegas definitely took care of our bachelorette party while we were in Vegas. Jason was very easy to reach and always available. Hot Shot Vegas was extremely accommodating to all of our needs. They were also able to help us out getting into clubs based on our budget.\n\nI definitely recommend them for whatever size party you have. Pricing was very reasonable and it beat standing in a taxi line any day of the week! =)\n\nThanks again Jason!! You made our trip so much smoother... I will definitely be giving you a call on our next trip out!!
1,"We found this restaurant to be just so-so. It was a bit overpriced for what it is. None of our food or drinks were bad, but nothing stood out either. With all the dining options in Vegas, it's a slippery slope when your food is forgettable. \n\nThe ambiance was nice and our server was attentive. However, I doubt we'll go back again."
1,"I give this place 2 stars only because the waitress was very annoying, she was walking back n forth and all around us talking very loud. Even when approaching us to ask questions when no one but another couple was in the restaurant she was very loud. I could not enjoy my lunch on my day off from work when all I wanted to do is go out to eat and relax. The chef that served us was very nice, friendly, and I enjoyed his service. I do want to come back because the sushi was great but service like that is not pleasant."
2,"Xposed Saturgays Pool Party Review Only. \n\nPros:\n- Clean and well-kept\n- Good music selection\n- Easy booking and check-in process\n- Good turn out and crowd\n\nCons:\n- Hidden Fees - Beware food/bev min is based on subtotal only. Does not include tax, auto gratuity, and a random service fee. A $400 food/bev subtotal comes out to roughly $525.  \n- Forgetful service - half of items ordered over the course of the day were forgotten and server had to be reminded next time they came by\n- No separate checks - servers can only split bills across 2 payments\n- Sub-par food - edible, but not delicious"
2,"To begin, walking through the Cosmopolitan was an incredible experience. I felt like I was literally walking into a movie. I'm not normally into glamour or luxury, but damn if I don't want to stay here the next time I'm in Vegas. I went here a few weekends ago on a Friday night to see W&W. My two girlfriends and I were on the guest list (our two guy friends bought tickets in advance and got inside before us) and probably had to wait around 25 minutes total to get inside. One thing I really didn't prepare for was the walk up the kinda-janky-yet-very-interesting stairs to get to the EDM floor. My friend wore flats that night and I was pretty jealous about an hour in. There aren't many places to sit if you don't have a table or a cabana, so beware. \n\nThe dance floor was super tiny, and it eventually was swollen with people two hours into the night. I was lucky I didn't have a drink because I was shoved around and stepped on until I decided to leave. I couldn't handle it anymore, plus my wedges were killing me. I went outside for a much needed drink and waited about 5 minutes to get served. $14 for my Maker's Mark and ginger. It got more and more packed inside and outside as the night went on. W&W killed it, but we could barely see their set because of the massive swells of people. The lights were awesome and the dancers were getting their hawt thang going! The bathrooms were really nice, and they have everything a woman would ever need for sale at the counters. The interior is super high class and beautiful as well as the outside. The pool is so tempting! I wanted to dunk my feet in a few times. \n\nI give Marquee Nightclub three stars because when I compared it to my experiences at other Vegas nightclubs, it didn't stand out. I'd definitely come back here again, but maybe next time I'll either bring flats in my bag or come with a crew of girls only to increase our chances of getting invited to a table."
0,"If I could give it a zero I would have. This was the worst nail job that I have ever had. I went into get fills on my pink and whites. I decided to get a color tip that turned into this thick big blob on my nails. It was the guy that has long hair that did my nails, he said that he has been doing them for 11 years. I don't honestly believe that he even has a license. My nails were so think and clumpy that he went to go put the gel on them and I told him that I did not like anything that he has done to my nails and that they are horrible. I had to ask him to sand them down more so that they didn't look like a 1st grader did my nails....he also took my nice curve that you have in your nail that seperates the tip and made it a straight or semi straight line. I asked him what happened to my curves and he just sat there. Not to mention the (2) smoking breaks he took while doing my nails....I mean who doesn't love leaving a nail salon with there hands smelling like smoke. I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!!!! A complete waste of money!!!!"
3,"I think that this is the closest off-campus restaurant to CMU. The price is fine and you get a large amount of food. The service here is quick and efficient, but no one is very friendly. That's fine, as I hardly ever eat in and only stop by to pick up a meal.\n\nTheir bubble tea is pretty good. I especially recommend the mango bubble tea. Also, the chow fun is pretty good as well.\n\nOverall, the food is tasty, the service is quick, and the price is alright. Not bad for a conveniently close restaurant"
4,"This is definitely one of the new hotspots to go in Chandler.\nThey just opened a little over a month ago and serve a fusion of Mexican and American food.\n\nThe food is good and the prices are very reasonable especially during happy hour and reverse happy hour.\nThe staff is super friendly and very attentive.  \n\nOn Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturday they have DJs spinning on the patio. They mix everything including rock, classic rock, hip hop, house, and usually pretty good about taking requests.\n\nDefinitely check it out!"
4,"Delicioso!\n\nKind of expensive for a popsicle, but its really good, and they have rent to pay!!\n\nDefinitely worth the splurge!"
4,Really good soups.\nGreat place to get caught up on work and grab a bit e at the same time
1,"Really hit or miss.\n\nWe got a gift card for Elephant Bar some time ago, so we have been there twice to use it up.  The first time, we ordered the chicken marsala and cream of asparagus soup.  FABULOUS.  Also, Elephant Bar has extraordinary iced tea.  The second time, my fianc\u00e9 duplicated his original order and I got a weeeeeeeeird salad with basil leaves in it.  His order, which was so great the time before, was super bland and the sauce was really lumpy.  My salad was utterly disgusting.  More than half the salad was basil leaves rather than lettuce.  Sure, I expected the basil, but as a complement to the salad itself... not that the basil itself was the salad!\n\nThe people who gave us the gift card have some notion that Elephant Bar is our favorite restaurant (not sure why), so I bet we'll be getting another gift card for the next major occasion.  It's a very Seinfeld-ish of situation.  That's the only reason I would likely return.  I really value consistency when I dine out... it's a major bummer when you come back for something (like my fianc\u00e9's chicken marsala), only to feel like you're eating a completely different dish."
3,I've only been here once and that was on a Thursday while a 90's rock cover band was playing. The band was way beyond fun (I honestly would have still enjoyed myself while sober) and being able to play beer pong added to the excitement.
3,"Nice ambiance, nice authentic spicy chinese food.  \nAs good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.\n \nOf all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.    \n \nFor some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week. \nAsian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.\n \nSide note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!\n \nSo I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  I'm happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy. \n \nWe all win."
3,"4.5 Stars\n\nOK boys and girls, for this one you'll be jumping in a time machine with me.  Destination...the ending of the year 1998.  Reason...I have the song \""Pretty Fly for a White guy\"" from The Offspring playing and helping out with this review.  The hook of the song goes like this:\n\nGive it to me baby...Uh-huh...Uh-huh!\n\nGive it to me baby...Uh-huh...Uh-huh!\n\nGive it to me baby...Uh-huh...Uh-huh!\n\nAnd all the girl say Papa Joe's fly for a fish guy!\n\nNow repeat this hook three or four times and thank me later for burning this song in your brain!  It may be a new song for you(look it up) or one that has been forgotten and put on the front burner again.  After placing my order and waiting for my fish I hear this hook. \n\nGive it to me baby...Uh-huh...Uh-huh!\n\nGive it to me baby...Uh-huh...Uh-huh!\n\nGive it to me baby...Uh-huh...Uh-huh!\n\nAnd all the girl say Papa Joe's fly for a fish guy!\n\nPapa Joe's Fish-N-Que has one of those qualities that is warm and instantaneously makes you feel comfortable when dining in.  There is nothing fancy about Papa Joe's but it's not suppose to be that.  The only thing that comes to mind is that this place is like going to a family member/really good friend's home that you can relate to.  I'll get to the food soon.  The second greatest thing here behind the food is the \""bang for your buck\"", you will certainly get a good value for what you will pay for.  Most everything comes as a combo which has a side/sides and drink.  \n\nPapa Joe's is located in a very tight strip mall and depending on your timing, parking can be tough.  Inside you will mainly find booths and a few high tables.  Not ideal for large parties.  You will find one small TV in the booth located in the rear right corner as you walk in.  You place your order and sit down.  Ordering happens to the left when you walk in.  Drinks are self serve, in the right center of the place.  Fountain soda station, brewed iced tea and three different Koolaid dispensers.  \n\nOnto the food!  I am only going to touch on a few items that my family and I have experienced.  Fish!!!  They have Catfish, Whiting and Cod which are all prepared regular or spicy.  The spicy cod is my favorite hands down.  These are the sides we have tried, many more available.  Fried okra, jalape\u00f1o hushpuppies, fries and sweet potato tater tots.  The jalape\u00f1o hushpuppies are out of this world.  The hot wings are a very good value too!  Good flavor but not the best quality of chicken, at least for the one time I had them.  The quality of the wings are not bad just have had better, but not even close to Papa Joe's price!   \n\nThey have burgers, various BBQ sandwiches, chicken strips, ribs, kids meals and fish sandwiches.  All that I have not tried yet, but each trip I will be trying new things.  The desserts look good but never have room after my meal."
1,The wait was really long for dinner. I got the falafel plate and the hummus was overly salty and more of an applesauce consistency than a hummus spread. The flavor wasn't great. they were out of the spinach pie. The falafel was really dark and super spiced. Too strong of a favor for me. The salad was the highlight of the meal but not enough to keep me coming back.
2,"Loved the look of this place as it was going up. The completion is fantastic from the outside. Gorgeous architecture. HOWEVER, INSIDE THE SCALE IS STERILE AND NOT HUMAN. (forgive caps) None of the shops or restaurants are for normal or even semi normal people as far as price is concerned. Even for Vegas the  prices are off the wall. See loads of people in Crystals but very few with shopping bags. This place was built in the middle of the biggest bubble in a century. It opened in the biggest bust. I predict this $8+ billion  baby will bankrupt MGM. Judging by the price I got for Aria in a few weeks occupancy is not that high. Looking at the restaujrant reviedws on YELP I'm not about to try any."
0,"If All Storage Las Vegas is anything like their associated site in Encinitas, do not rent here.  Their security system doesn't work.  Our unit in Encinitas was broken in and they did not follow up on the alarm (on a weekday at 2 pm!) nor could they provide any video to the police (hard drive crash).  We lost lots of good things and they didn't seem to care.  Read the entire story here http://www.724network.com/All%20Storage/index.html"
0,"don't go here.\nafter reading reviews, i went to it.\ni and my friend ordered 2 pastas. they were horrible taste.\nalfredo didn't have anything. only it and sauce.\nif you are very hungry, i want to recoomend here.\nthey serve huge amount of pastas"
4,"They certainly have everything, from tiaras to bottles of that stuff you use to create real-looking wounds. A little on the pricey side, but excellent stuff overall."
2,"This place visually is gorgeous. The decor, the music, and the smells. I have been here three times and have both good and not so good things to say about it.\n\nThe Good: the service, the ambiance, the drink menu, great looking people, the bathrooms, the bread, the desserts are yummo !!!\n\nNot so good: the amount of ice they put in the drinks, some of the food is not so great : example..we ordered the poopoo platter and the pork was dry that I didn't want to eat it and same with the ribs"
2,"One of the \""alrights.\"" Their nigiri sushi is always fresh. The slices of fish are on the small side but I've never eaten a bad roll here. Once, I ordered a Caterpillar roll and they actually made it look like a caterpillar. :) sweet guys behind the sushi bar!! Kaya has an awesome variety of sushi and appetizers. They have the best baked mussels in town and they even have a number of grilled skewers and Korean foods on their AYCE menu. Bulgogi, kimchi fried rice.\n\nThis place is great to come with a friend, by yourself, or with a group. The servers here are very nice as well! My friends and I have had 3 group events here and the girls remember us! Then again, How could they not, we're loud and rowdy when we get together and the group room is outfitted with tambourines and karaoke!! \n\n\nSplitting checks is NOT a problem here! They'll do it 13 ways if they have to. So for parties, don't stress about splitting the bill!"
2,"Really wanted to like this place :( 3 stars just for the fried yuca. The meat in my arepa tasted like steamed dog food, had a really gamey flavor. We literally took the rest of our arepas home and gave it to our dog"
4,"The food, the ambience, and the service is amazing! We had been here once before, but we sat at a booth, so we felt like a second experience was needed before I wrote a review because we wanted to try something different this time around by sitting at the Hibachi tables. Just like the first experience, our second time here was just as amazing! Everyone is so friendly, our server was incredibly helpful by giving great suggestions and answering all of our questions, our chef was so entertaining, and the manager was very kind. We enjoyed the Hibachi table just as much as we enjoyed dining the first time we were here. We left happy and completely stuffed. We will definitely be back again! :)"
3,"4 stars food\n0 stars service, it was totally abysmal this time.  what up with that?  the girl at the front was a total you know what.  anyway...its a good thing the whole food experience saved the day."
3,"Went here for dinner Saturday night. Very nice place. We were greeted at the door, shown to our table. Within seconds we had salsa and chips. our server was great. Brought our drinks quickly. the salsa was a little to hot and spicy for me, the chips were fresh. We ordered bean dip which was very good. I liked the touch of the red onion. It was a small amount and not overwhelming. \nI ordered the charbroiled chicken. BF had the sweet potato enchilada. Both meals were excellent. \nWe will be dining here again. Really enjoyed our meal."
3,This is such a classic restaurant. I love going here after a little Forum shopping. I have never had anything bad and the service is always excellent.\n\nMy favorite appetizer is the Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna and the Carpaccio of Beef Tenderloin- Delicious! I always get the Beefsteak Tomato Capri because it is my all time favorite salad. The Linguine and Clams Sauce is excellent if you are looking for a pasta dish. The Chilean Sea Bass is also a great choice for a light fish dinner.\n\nFor dessert the Key Lime Pie is a must. This restaurant will not disappoint.
0,"I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. \n\nThe sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say \""sacrificed or as important\"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). \n\nThe venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, \""don't wear pants,\"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly \""cooler\"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? \n\nThe answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. \n\nHate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms."
1,"This place does not have management? ! They were busy as hell,and slow,slow,slow,slow that was just killing me,I love the bread it is really good but  personal it slow .I give 5 start for the bakery  and 0000000 start for the SLOW SLOW Employees, and instead of helping to ring up the costumers they were doing other stuff and OWNER PUT ATTENTION TO YOUR BUSINESS!"
0,"Amazing food. We really love it. Only one slight problem. We like to sit at the bar. Our last two trips there have been interrupted by cockroaches crawling up the front of the bar inches from my wife. Once, we gave them a pass, twice we called the Clark County Health Department.  Risotto at $22...does that include or exclude the roaches....you'd never be able to tell!"
0,"After having a lovely meal two years ago at the grand concourse, we were very excited to return to this location. Unfortunately our expectation had nothing to do with the reality of a very poor meal.\n\nThe service was slow to the point of neglect. Drinks were never refilled after the initial serving. With a party of six, three of the meals we're delivered cold after a 25 minute wait. Having to send them back it took another 25 minutes to get the replacement meals which were missing the sauces, etc..  It took a manager to get the sauces for the meals. At this point half of our party had eaten, and the other half was ready to leave.\n\nWe had to box our own meals, and forget about being asked if we would like a cup of coffee to cap the meal... That was not in the stars. \n\nNeedless to say, we will not be back."
1,"We went to Jasper's Peak courtesy of a Groupon my companion picked up. I'm fairly glad we didn't pay full price considering how disappointed I was with our experience this evening.\n\nWe ordered the crab dip, the voodoo chicken (with added shrimp), and the jambalaya. \n\nThe crab dip ($9) had a nice texture (not too wet), but didn't have a distinctive flavor. We doused this liberally with hot sauce, which was a significant improvement. It was served with blue corn tortilla chips, which provided a good contrast with our spiced up version.\n\nThe voodoo chicken ($16) had a delicious smokiness to it, and the shrimp (4 for an additional $4.50) were a nice complement. The jambalaya ($16) was weak, thin and not terribly filling. The rice was the best part of the jambalaya as it had time to soak up the sauce, which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe meats were all nicely done, but it was obvious that they were cooked separately outside of their sauces and assembled later. They were a bit bland unless you were certain that you rolled them about in your sauce. \n\nThe service could have been significantly better. Our water glasses were often empty for long stretches, and our waitress Rebecca's friendliness seemed forced and artificial. The place was fairly dead, but we weren't checked on until our meals were almost finished. She asked how our food was at that point but didn't even wait for my answer before she walked away. Service was fairly slow throughout the meal, even though I could see our plates waiting on the service counter.\n\nI wanted to love this place as it is far closer to me than Baby Kay's, but I'm not going to settle for such poor service at this price.\n\nAlso, the bartender seemed very friendly, guiding the gentleman at the table next to us through a tasting in order for him to make a wine selection. We didn't drink tonight, but I was impressed.\n\nPros:\n- Quiet.\n- Large patio area.\n- Clean.\n\nCons:\n- No reservation for parties fewer than six.\n- Service can be spotty."
3,"This review applies only to the breakfast burritos, I have not tried any of the other dishes.  I am a breakfast enthusiast, breakfast burritos being my greatest weakness.  The breakfast burritos are large, filled with the right proportion of potato, meat, and eggs.  Service is always friendly and fast, I can be in and out within 5 minutes with a hot fresh burrito and on time for work. Love the fresh green sauce as well."
0,"Not sure why we ate here but we were at NYNY because our girls wanted to ride the roller coaster.\n\nIn any case, we decided on Mexican and boy was that a mistake.  I ordered the fish tacos and the fish was really quite fowl tasting ~ not fresh at all.  Okay, so I moved onto the refried beans and rice ~ simply the worst ever ~ how hard is it to make rice and beans anyway???\n\nThe waitress noticed that I hardly touched my food and asked if she could bring me anything else.  I deferred given that they could not make decent rice & beans.\n\nTo top it off, I had to argue with both the waitress and manager to have the  meal removed from the bill.... Enough said."
1,"I've never checked in at this airport, restricted entirely to layovers. What stands out, however, is how many fellow fliers I spend time with complain about the check-in service and security. I don't know what's going on from that side, but I hear it time and again.\n\nFrom my side, I can't help but notice that I have to change gates nearly every flight thru there. Since I'm usually sleeping, I've been lucky to wake up shortly before the announcement with time to make the gate-change. As has been noted in other reviews, the terminals are far apart and gate changes can be rather drastic.\n\nOne big positive is the lack of arm rests on the seats. This makes it real easy for a peep to catch up on some quality nappage. There are also a lot of places to eat or drink at, all with the standard airport mark-up but with at least some variety. This 'port makes for an acceptable layover, but I've so far been able to avoid checking in here and suggest the same."
3,"I stopped in for lunch after a client meeting today and all and all thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I wasn't feeling too adventurous with my menu selections and opted to keep it simple with a house salad, solely for the purpose of the ginger dressing, and a Philly sushi roll. The standard menu items that I ordered were delicious and I gobbled them up right away. The service was super friendly and fast. Any need that we had was meet before we could ask for it. I even believe that the server picked up on the fact that I was gabbing away to my coworker and respected that fact being attentive without interrupting.\n\nThe atmosphere was great. I think my favorite part about this experience was the decor. Typically, I find that places like this tend to go overboard, but everything here was balanced. There was just the right amount of culture, while maintaining a contemporary feel to the restaurant. For example, hanging down from the ceiling, they had brightly colored open umbrellas (hanging from the handles) and behind the sushi bar, the backdrop was a water fall wall. I'm not too familiar with the Baxter Village scene, but would venture to guess this would be a great place to post up and do some people watching on their massive patio.\n\nOverall, my impression of this place was solid. The food didn't \""wow\"" me, but it was a great place to stop in for lunch."
4,"I was at my wits end trying to harness the energy of my Vizsla puppy Finnegan.  He was literally bouncing off the walls and various pieces of furniture in my house.  I was seriously in need of my own personal dog whisperer.  A client who owns two Bull Mastiffs highly recommended Team Canine to me, and after a one-on-one training session at my house, I will happily recommend them to all of you in Yelpdom.  Their training techniques are based on positive reinforcement and a true understanding of dog psychology.  They have group classes in addition to the personal training.  I am definitely going to enroll in the group obedience class."
0,"If I could leave 0 stars, I would. Dirty. Gross. Stinks. I'm sad to say I've wasted my money here. 3 rooms later and they had to send housekeeping up to RE CLEAN my room. This was supposed to be for a VIP!!! Crumbs on the floor, hair in the sink. At least it didn't have someone else's toothpaste running down the vanity like the first room. Get new management staff in housekeeping. Someone isn't doing their job. Shameful. \n\nHonestly, the only good thing I have to say is... Luke at the desk is great and Mr. Peeples (management staff) is kind as well. \n\nBut 3 rooms... Seriously. Get it together."
1,"I hate the quality of tint used on my car. I had my previous car tinted years ago and it noticeably kept the heat out of my car to a more normal level.  I again chose a dark tint for my new car and everyday my car is EXTREMELY hot. It was not worth the hundreds of dollars since my car is still hot.  I'm not happy at all.!!!! It's as if I have no tint at all. If that's the case, what's the point??? I just wasted my money."
0,"This place sucks...... no seafood..... service is not great and people are not too friendly.after asking the waiter if they offered any seafood at all he just replied with\"" you have the menu,read it,I will be back\"""
3,"This days inn is very nice.  Google mislead us and it was a little farther than we thought it was from the highway, but we found it eventually.  Note that the advertised parking amenities are for you to pay $12 per night to park in a sketchy lot across the street - not cool.  But the rooms are very nice and clean, and the staff were very friendly even though we did not speak french."
4,"This place is a must-go!  We went there this weekend for the first time and the service was excellent.  Not only that, but the doughnuts were exceptional.  It has been hard for me to find a good-family owned bakery since I moved to Madison, but here it has been all along!  We will definitely be back soon.  My favorites were the sprinkle ones and the apple fritter looked amazing.  The girl working said they don't make long-johns all the time, mainly for special orders, but I bet those would be great!  I may just have to special order some!! Check it out!  But...get there early!!  Before 7 on a Sunday!"
2,"We went to Red Lobster for lunch just after 2 PM.  It was moderately busy but we were quickly seated.  All three of us had the Endless Shrimp and between us, we had most of the varieties.  All were good, but nothing spectacular.  Service was not exactly speedy, but wasn't slow enough to put me off either.  Everyone was extremely courteous and pleasant.  $57.00 for three lunch specials was more than I am used to paying in a town known for inexpensive food, but it wasn't unexpected.  All-in-all, just as the rating says \""A-OK\""."
4,Great vet clinic. They have full service including a fabulous groomer.
4,The food is absolutely amazing. Had a cubana sandwich and fries with a coke was one of the best lunches i have ever had!!! The waitresses were very nice too!
2,"A very enjoyable Barbecue chain. A lot of people have suggested that I try Lucille's but my desire to do so had been low. Probably because from the outside it looks like just another overpriced family restaurant. Now that I've been inside, it kind of gives you that impression when you walk in, too. There's a decent decor, but there's also all that junk on the wall that gives it an Applebee's kind of feel. Long lines to get in (mostly due to huge parties) also don't help out. \n\nFortunately, the food is really good. \n\nYou get biscuits with a side of maple butter which is quite enjoyable. We started with a half order of onion straws. Unless you're with a big group stick to the smaller size. Even though these fried strips of onion were addicting and hard to stop eating, it was still too much for just two people. The BBQ ranch sauce its served with is also really good (and I am not a big ranch fan). \n\nBoth my girlfriend and I had sandwiches as our meals. I went with the brisket and portabello with honey roasted peanut slaw. The brisket was wonderful. Not too soft like most places tend to serve it when in sandwich form. Can't say that I was a big fan of slaw. Nothing special about it, and the vinegar in the recipe just didn't do it for me, and the peanuts didn't add anything to the flavor, they just felt thrown in. \n\nMy girlfriend had the Smokehouse sliders with BBQ chicken. While they give you the option of pork, chicken, or brisket, Lucille's doesn't let you mix and match which you want. I really don't get that policy consider there isn't a price difference between the meats. It's not like they're smoking it up on order (and if they are, there's a big problem considering it takes hours to smoke meat). I guess it's too hard to the kitchen staff to grab from two different places. Either way, she enjoyed the chicken. She had a side of sweet potato fries which were really good. \n\nLike most Barbecue chains, Lucille's pimps its own sauces. The three that were brought to the table were original (the best; loaded with flavor), Hot and Spicy (neither hot or spicy, not bad, just not close to what I was expecting), and Memphis style (I'm not familiar with Memphis style barbecue, but this was pretty much just ketchup). I recommend sticking to the original. \n\nWe chose to sit in the bar (open seating and full menu) to avoid a short Sunday night wait and watch the basketball game. There's four big TVs placed across the bar, but someone did a very bad job placing them in their spots. There's a couple of support beams in the room which block the views. We easily found a seat that allowed us to see the game were were interested in, but my view of the TVs playing the baseball game were blocked.\n\nOverall, the place isn't much to look at, but the food is good."
3,Went there last night with a big group after a day of conference. We had a great time. I shared the cowboy steak and the porter house steak with some friends. I like much better the cowboy steak which was perfectly cooked medium rare with a very nice crust. Service was good as well. All my group had a great time and enjoyed their food.
2,"I probably didn't get around the entire park, but the parts that I did get to didn't really impress me.\n\nIt was nice to see all the ducks, and to get a good walk around the lakes/ponds, but that was about it.\n\nThere was so much bird and duck crap on all the picnic tables, sidewalks, and ground that you constantly look at the ground as you are walking like a paranoid crazy person lol.\n\nWe did a mini picnic with cupcakes from Retro, and were feeling uneasy after the ducks started circling us looking for freebies lol.  But too bad ducks, we didn't waste the goodies on you!\n\nAlso didn't see any areas for the kids to really play.  No playgrounds, just areas where they would chase the ducks crazy and throw rocks, which is obviously a no go.  Give the kids something to do, so they don't get in trouble getting into things!  Maybe they have one somewhere, but us walking for an hour or two came up short with no results.\n\nIt also costs $6 to drive in here, which isn't much money, but since we didn't really get any major enjoyment outta our visit, it felt unnecessary.  Guess I will stick with the regular parks for our little one."
1,"Well just having spent the past weekend at the valley Ho, it was interesting to compare the two hotel concepts and restaurants . Both being old outdated hotels remodeled into somewhat trendy urban hot spots. I walked into the lobby and was pleasantly surprised by the decor. Artsy in a \""raw\"" sort of way. Exposed ceilings, cheap local art for purchase on the walls, a view of the really cool pool area, then walked into the \""gallo blanco\"". I was 1 of 2 people there. I sat at the bar\nI sat down and scanned the menu that was on the chalkborarded walls. The server handed me a wine list. I had vino blanco from Argentina. It was ice cold and served in what appeared to be a Riedel \""o\"" glassware.I  Liked this. Things are going well at this point. Then I ordered just one Fish Taco. I wasn't real hunger so this small taco was the perfect size. It was served on a small corn tortilla, the fish was halibut and it was nicely grilled. If I ordered it again I would have them hold the white sauce that tasted like \""miracle whip\""?? the fish was so fresh, it would have been perfect with just the avocado, and lettuce. Conversation was going fine with the server unitl for some reason he asked my age, which I thought was odd. then from there the conversation digressed into some political and philosophical debate?? I was just looking to unwind with some vino and food and to relax. I guess I may give Gallo Blanco  another shot to try some other things on the menu, but I would probably bring a friend along next time, and avoid the politics :)"
1,"I made the mistake of having such high expectations of China Poblano because they were just completely crushed.  I had heard so much about  culinary genius, Jose Andres and that is the reason I even went into the restaurant after perusing the menu.  If it was not associated with Jose Andres, I would have immediately done a 180 after seeing the $11.00 price tag on a serving a dim sum.  \n\nJose Andres is known for his tapas servings and so our group ordered a number of tapas servings to share.  And they were just OK.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either.  If I am paying $8 for a mini mini pork sandwich- it BETTER blow my mind, and it did not.  My favorite dish was the eggplant dish, but it wasn't fabulous enough for me to return. I even tried eating the Chinese dish and Mexican dish, side by side to see if that would make a difference in the \""experience\"", but it didn't.  In fact, I still don't get it.  It was not a fusion restaurant, but rather two menus in one. \n\nThe ambience is cool and trendy, but next time I am considering Mexican or Chinese, I will definitely go elsewhere, where the flavor satisfaction matches the price.  I can get ambience elsewhere."
2,"There are many other pasta places in town that I'd choose over Olive Garden. But they boyfriend had a gift card and free money is free money, right? The night before we ran a 5K, we decided to pay OG a visit and carb up. \n\nThere was about a 15 minute wait when we arrived on a Friday night. Looking around, there were plenty of tables opened, but I guess they were short on staff. A couple of booths were open at the bar area along with plenty of bar seating but we were never offered a spot there. We decided to wait it out. No biggie. \n\nOur server provided speedy service. No complaints here. They had a great deal going on: three course Italian dinner for $12.95.\n\nAppetizer: You can choose from unlimited salad or soup. I chose the salad. Your typical appetizer salad. My boyfriend got chicken gnocchi soup. This was alright. Gnocchi had a grainy consistency to it. But the soup was tasty. He finished the bowl. Hot and fresh breadsticks were also brought out. No sauce. Sauce is an extra charge. \n\nEntree: I got the three cheese ravioli. Your typical ravioli. I really wish I had hot sauce to give it some flavor. I should seriously carry a bottle of hot sauce in my bag at all times for this! Anyways, my boyfriend got the Penne di Mare. This is pretty good. Small pieces of shrimp with cream sauce over penne pasta. Apparently, scallops were supposed to be in this dish. I didn't see any, but the dish definitely had the scallop-seafoody taste. \n\nDessert: I got the chocolate mousse cake. Pretty darn decadent. I think this was the best part of the meal. But then again, I love anything chocolate. Give me chocolate and I'm easily satisfied. Boyfriend got the strawberry and white chocolate dolcini. This is way too sweet. Stay away. \n\nOverall experience was alright. We got what we came for (carbs, carbs, carbs) and left with a full belly. But the next time I come here will be only when I have a gift card to spend freely."
0,"Dirty tables, soiled floors, and bad food.  According to a dated publication posted on the restaurant's wall,  it was the owner's long time dream to open a restaurant.  The publication shocks me for two reasons: the restaurant is dirty and the food is awful... that doesn't feel dreamy to me.   I ordered the sliders.  The wife ordered a turkey club sandwich.  Safe bets considering this is our first visit.  It was hard to find an open table and that's not because the restaurant was busy (at the top of the lunch hour, we were the only patrons)... we couldn't find a clean table.  I guess the dream didn't factor in employees who would rather drink lattes and watch football games than clean tables and floors.  Then came the food. The sliders were clumsily made, the onion straws were cold,  and the mac n' cheese was unseasoned and bland.  My wife's  sandwich was mediocre and  elementary (in my lazy college days, I made better sandwiches with half the sobriety of the restaurant cooks... granted I'm making a big assumption). In short, save your money and spare yourself the nightmare... find another spot."
2,"I've been to AZ88 for years and taken many friends from out of town. Love the food for the most part, but in the last 2-3 visits their service had been below average. The last time we were there I had two very dirty forks with food stuck in them, and a glass with lipstick. The bacon wrapped water chestnuts have gone down in quality significantly over the years: burned bacon, smaller chestnuts, and dry dry dry. They used to be amazing...\nThe second to last time I took family there, the ac was not working or was set really high, a huge problem in Arizona. With that said, the drinks are still pretty darn good!"
1,"Loved this place for a while. I don't mind that it's closed on Sundays as I work on the weekends. The problem I find is that checkout usually takes about 20 minutes, sometimes longer. Tons of checkout stations with very little staff. 6 stations, 2 open with 30 people in line at one in the afternoon. Usually you hear the manager get on the speaker \""cashiers to the front\"". Not here. Just wait in line, wasting away the day. It wouldn't bother me as much if I didn't see 20 or more employees walking around all over the store. \n\nEven with the long lines, this was the only store that sold Dill buttons. If you aren't someone that uses buttons that often, this means nothing. Dill makes high quality buttons for blazers and suits. Metal and plastic. The Hobby Lobby brand and most other brands are plastic crap. Recently HL has stopped selling Dill and only offers the store brand so they can do 2 for 1 specials. \n\nAt least I don't have to bother with the lines anymore. Now I order online."
2,"Forget the casino where your wallet takes a pounding, this is where your body takes punishment. But look at yourself in the mirror, man, you did it to yourself. Leg of lamb, prime rib, wild boar, kalbi ribs, spicy shrimp, mac-n-cheese, gnocchi, cheeses, salads, breads, and then the... OK stuff, which is too much too mention. Eye in the sky sees you eating like a gluttonous pig. Pace self with sanctity. #foodslut"
4,"Simply  BREATH TAKING.. Went here with  hunny  for dinner .. It was simply  beautiful.. We had someone greet us at the doorstep, very courteous and friendly.  i love the atmosphere there because it's so relaxing, tranquil, and seems away from it all.\n\nDinner was beyond my  expectations  I had lobster bisque, not too creamy, I liked that. They often have some great vegetarian options as well.. I had the edamame/ scallion ravioli and martini which was delicious  . Hunny  had the fillet minus the bacon..\n\nOh...this place has some of the best views of Camelback and Paradise Valley .  Upon arrival, you can feel your shoulders start to drop and let the relaxation begin..."
0,"I stayed two night in Vdara, and I had a unpleasant experience here. The first day we checked in Vdara, I took a nap on the bed. After a while, I felt one of my leg was itchy and I lifted the quilt, and found there were some black spots peppered on the sheet. I was shocked, because I didn't expected the hotel like Vdara would make such mistake. I called the housing keeping instantly and asked for changing the sheet. Then I asked the manager to come as well, the African American manager took a picture and said he would report it, and would compensate us for that. Yet, two days latter, I still didn't hear back from Vdara. :( It seems like Vdara is not value about customer experience. not recommended."
3,"The only reason TK's doesn't get 4 stars is because the pricing could have been better for lunch.  Other than that though, I ordered the burger, my boyfriend got the salmon, and both were amazing!  \n\nService was prompt and the atmosphere was just what you would expect it to be at Scottsdale Quarter: a few tables on business lunch, a couple families, and golfers ready to grub.  All of this amidst a small bar, brick detailing, and a fancily upholstered booth parallel to the kitchen, where chefs can be seen whisking, flipping, and plating away.  The burger was one of the best in the valley, with a choice of fries or arugula salad (I chose the healthy option this time).  The salmon was pan-seared to perfection, atop a bed of fingerling potatoes and green beans.\n\nWith many dining options at the Quarter, this is one that I am sure to taste again... and maybe even try that pulled pork that everyone is raving about."
2,Very good food.  They just moved locations across the street to the old seesaw location. Good food can't really choose a bad item however the atmosphere is very ho hum.
0,Expensive drinks? No big deal. Almost 100% hipster crowd? Fine. The problem here is the way the management treats its customers. We sat at a table upstairs at 9:00 PM. At 11:20 we were asked to move to another table. We complied and five minutes later were asked to give up the actual table. Two minutes later they came and took our chairs. Simple as that. I won't be back and I was embarassed to have taken my out of town guest there.
3,Amazing prime rib was so tender. The green beans are a must. The only downside was the price. $125 for the surf n turf!
2,"Again a weekend in Las Vegas. Though, this time around, not so drunk. More broke, sober (hungover) than ever, the last night in Vegas was more spent walking around and people watching. We could have just eaten at McDonald's or Chipotle, but going by the simple rule of trying places I don't have locally, we walked past this place under the glass biosphere-dome of the Mirage.\n\nBeing more attracted to the \""outdoorsy\"" feel then anything else about this place, we decide to charge up the card with this place. A \""Dinner for 2\"" was offered, whereas for $45 a select menu listing of item could be had. We wanted to see more since the select item menu seemed very limited.\n\nI stuck with the meat cause I hate fish and seafood. My date got the crab cakes. I got the beef you cook on a hot rock (The Rock) and some glazed hot wings.\n\nIf you're hungry, don't bother.\n\nThe portions are tiny. The beef slices I got were so thin. I swear I get more meat from a 99 cent pack of Carl Buddig ham. The hot wings were drummettes cut oddly, where the joint to the ankle of the drumstick was chopped off leaving you with oddly placed bone fragments perfect for slicing your mouth and throat. The crab cakes looked like stinky KFC biscuits.\n\nThe service, though, was outstanding. It had better be for the $70 we spent. (That's like 10 Chipotle Burritos!)\n\nI am not really accustomed to over-paying for tiny meals, so take that into account. But what we got tasted good.\n\nThere is also a lounge area with drink specials, also under the glass dome. And, what we noticed later, a more-indoor, more-restaurant-feeling separate section of the place. 'Sides, that biodome section got really dark for dinner."
2,"Overall I love enterprise and it is generally my \""go to\"" rent a car company.  But if they want honest feedback - here it is. And this review deals with this specific experience.\n\nThe Employees were very friendly! Offered bottled water to a very full waiting room - \nWait was reasonable.  First car had a terrible odor - smelled like somebody smoked in the car and then tried to cover it up with baby powder - I couldn't take it - so traded in the car.  They were very understanding but it was a pain to have to go back.  Second car was great except that the windshield (on the inside) was filthy. The glare during sunset was dangerous and I could write my name it was so bad.  Their cleaners need to wipe the inside not just the outside."
0,"Not good.\n\nFirst, beware of the scammer who's gonna greet you and ask you if you were interested in fixing \""the chips' on your windshield.\n\nThen, are you interested in paying +$15 for a car wash that doesn't bother cleaning your cup holder or empty your car's ashtray?\n\nLastly, even their express car wash machine is terrible. It left deep scratches and swirls on my car.\n\nThe owners should save their dignity and close this place or consider giving customers better service."
2,"it's OK. I stopped by this bakery on the way to the bank, looking for something to satisfy my sweet tooth. Nothing really caught my eye or got my mouth watering. \n\nI ended up picking two chocolate patties with peanut butter filling ($4/both). I wasn't two impressed: the cake seemed a bit stale and the filling was not creamy.\n\nI do have to say some of the cakes didn't look half bad. But, it seemed like Paddy Cake is comparable to the bakery section of your typical grocery store which is disappointing since I'm always on the lookout for mouth watering sweets."
4,"What can I say about this place that hasn't all ready been said. I went to this because of yelp, usually I make a list of the top places in Vegas to go eat at, but I usually get side tracked you never know what's going to happen over there so one day at midnight me and my wife went after a show I was thinking I need to budget after hitting up the fine dining spots so we went here all I have to say is that we showed up at midnight and the next day we where back at 9 am for round two the tacos are Bomb. The tacos al pastor are authentic, I don't care how much you think you know by going to places around the world and having the best tacos this place is good and original. This place started in Tijuana and moved to San Diego and is booming in Vegas. I live in the high desert and think about taking of to Vegas just grab some tacos all the time. If your going to Vegas on a budget don't go but if you end up going hit this place up. Don't forget to ask for some grilled onions and chiles and burnt tostada all that is complimentary."
2,"I'm not an expert on Thai food but everything I tasted was good. For appetizers, we had a shrimp tom yum, which was listed as 2 chilis on the spicy scale, and was nicely perfumed as well; spring rolls, imperial rolls, (which I didn't taste but which my dining companions enjoyed very much); a papaya salad that was quite spicy; and a salad of beef sauteed with chilis that was nice and tender.\n\nMains were a red curry of pork and bamboo shoots; a green curry loaded with fish, squid and shrimp as well as zucchini and Thai eggplant; noodles with chicken and basil; and bbq crispy duck. I expected the green curry to be hotter than the red but they were about the same. I was disappointed with the noodles as I couldn't seem to locate the meat in it. The duck, on the other hand, was wonderfully crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside. The sauce complemented it nicely without overpowering it.\n\nWe had green tea icecream and mango icecream for dessert. It was the usual fare - nothing to write home about. However, the banana fritters were light and crispy, which is rare.\n\nThe decor is classy and discreet, and the staff were friendly and helpful. It was not cheap though at $150 (inc tax, sans tip), considering we drank tea. I enjoyed my food quite a lot but wouldn't rave about it."
1,"I stayed at the Palazzo but accidentally checked in at the Venetian. The lady that checked me in was very rude and talk down to me. Every question I asked she acted like I was burdening her. She then gave me directions to the Venetian side and we carried our luggage all the way to the 18th floor not realizing we had to go to the 18th floor of the Palazzo. She checked me in, she should have directed metro the palazzo. The Palazzo hotel was great."
3,"After reading about the wait most people have at Babycakes Cafe I decided to give another breakfast place a try (I'll try Babycakes one day...). So I Yelped a spot and was instantly intrigued by Rise and Shine. It was the location-not far from where I live- and those darn cute flower umbrellas that they have hanging from their ceiling.\nIt was busy but with a ten minute wait on a Sunday Morning I'm not complaining....The flower umbrellas were so cute and everytime the door opened the air spinned some of them around-Whimsical I tell ya!!!\nAnyways, I did also enjoy all the mosaics on the walls as well-Artsie!!!\n\nThe food= An option for bread is a cinnamon bread baked in a flower pot with a knife stabbed in the top served with butter and strawberry jam. Let me tell ya one is not enough- It was so good but I wish those flower pots were fatter for more darn warm yummy bread. Cute idea though...\nI loved reading that the Chicken in the Chicken and Waffles was a chicken breast-YAY!!!!!! So I picked that and it was really good. The breading was pretty tasty and spicy as well and the chicken breast was pounded flat so you got a pretty big piece. My daughter got a short stack of pancakes-So fluffy and good too...Now on to the grumpy BF who already was having attitude-He got eggs,hash browns and bacon-He was not impressed and hated his bacon-Oh well, so sad....I tried his food and it was fine he is just too particular about his bacon but like I told him thats why you have a voice use it and request what you like!!!\nI will be back and the BF can wait in the car...."
0,"I came to this cleaners for a bridesmaid dress to be altered and I was extremely happy with it.  Since I live close by I figured I would try the Dry Cleaning side of.  I will NEVER EVER come back to this place again.  I feel like I was totally ripped off.  \n\nI dropped my clothes off on a Thursday and she said to pick them up on Tuesday.  (Open all weekend so why so long).  I came in today Tuesday at 4pm.  She told me they JUST STARTED working on my items and she would call me when they would be ready.  1 hour later she said they were ready.  I picked them up, took them home and this is when I get heated.  \n\nMy Herve Leger dress I dropped off was the only thing that looked cleaned.  I had black shoe polish stains on it from an event I had attended and lucky for me they came out and the dress looked brand new.  I made such a stink about this dress to the older Asian lady at the front of the store, she knew I was going to make sure this dress was spotless when I came back.  All my other shirts still had water stains on them and they looked dirty still.  It looked like all my other items were just pressed so they looked like they were treated.  I think they ran out of time and got lazy and so they cleaned the Herve Leger dress and just pressed the other items to save time and to rip me off! I called as soon as I got home and noticed all of this and the same lady played dumb with me.  She said I could come back the next day and they would fix it but as I told her before, I was going out of the country and needed these items.  She then said to bring them in when I get back and they will correct the issue but to be honest, after reading others reviews on this place, I do not trust Sparkle Cleaners.  I'll take a loss on this and go back to my other dry cleaners across town.   Save yourself the trouble people!!"
1,1 star for the fries that keep me coming back like a bad itch. Plus one more for the 24 hour bit - for the pure entertainment watching people passed out over their booth. Awesome.
0,"Sat for 15minutes no one came to serve us, they checked on the booth in front of us, but ignored us completely. Going to Cracker Barrel down the road."
1,"\""Meh. I've experienced better.\""\n\nThere have been people who have been persuading me to go here, convincing me its going to be revolutionary for a burger joint. Seeing as how burgers are generally redundant as is to me, I decided to take a shot. \n\nThe only thing I've found good was the mint milkshake, and that was it. Fries were bland, meat was bland, the whole burger was nothing special. I think their sauces actually attempt to make up for how bland their patties are, because honestly I could have gotten the same stuff for $3 cheaper elsewhere. \n\nThe location is fairly busy, and because of this, a little bit of a wait for both seating and take-out. The staff is fairly friendly and attentive. I don't see what is so great about Steak 'N Shake, it really wasn't anything special to myself."
4,Best doughnuts in Chandler. Fresh doughnuts made throughout the day. Every drink under the sun besides coffee.
3,"The DMV stereotype has been around since the beginning of time.  I have to admit that the Henderson DMV isn't that bad.  I know you are gasping for air right now.  \""How could he say that about the DMV?\""  Every time I come here the employees are super nice.  In fact I was surprised the first time, but now come to know that they hired some great people.  This is a hard job and they do a great job making the process as enjoyable as they can.  The last time we went we were registering a car we just bought.  We only waited about 30 mins and it was Saturday morning.  So needless to say it was pretty packed.  When we were going through the process the girl (I wish I could remember her name.) told us that our smog was rejected.  I was confused because this was the dealership's fault.  She was really nice and told us to go take care of it and when we got back to come back to her.  After yelling at the dealership and having them resmog the car, we went back.  The girl was with a customer so we waiting a few minutes.  Here is where it gets better.  The lady working next to her was done with her customer before our girl and then she helped us.  This was awesome!  She also gave our daughters stickers.  Don't let the DMV scare you.  This place is great and the employees make it better.  Bet you never thought someone would be saying this about a DMV!  Cheers!"
2,"I called to make an appt. for my dog to be groomed and the groomer was very 'short' with me as if I was annoying her by inquiring about an appt.  \nWhen I showed up at the scheduled time, she quickly sent me away saying she doesn't groom certain breeds which was not mentioned on the phone at the time of the appt.  I can see why she works with animals and not people since she is abrupt and unpleasant. The only reason for the 3 star is their self-grooming is convenient and affordable."
4,"We had a problem with the way a poster was mounted for framing at another Michael's location and took it to the nearest location to us on East Camelback. We spoke with Shane , the manager of the framing section. He was very polite and helpful. He had us leave the framed print for remounting and personally handled the work the next day at no charge. We couldn't be happier with the quality of the work and the way in which we were treated."
4,"just had lunch here today and ordered the shoarma combo (chicken and gyros) and it was delish!!! the chicken was season just the way i like it: not overly seasoned and not too strong, just right!!! the gyros was nice and moist... i ordered it with the hommus as a side and it was served with plenty of pita!!! i definetly did not leave hungry! especially since we also got baklava for dessert which was amazing!!!!\n\ni will be back here very shortly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"So this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom. Almost couldn't even sit down to go. (yuck) ok on to the rest. The chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice. The Numero 15 is a cheese enchilada with a chicken taco rice and beans. The only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa. It was so bland. I don't know that it was worth the $3 parking validation we came for. My friend and I love Mexican so we picked it on our way elsewhere, my suggestion go elsewhere."
0,I ordered the steak omelet...When my order arrived it had no steak...Then I had the waitress take it back...She gave me a new order that had steak on it...but then the egg wasn't cooked all the way...and I mean it was almost raw. I sent it back for the third time and finally got the right order.
1,"10/23/13\n\nAt the VA facility today for long awaited appointments. Prior to departing I had the opportunity to visit the travel office. At the travel office I picked up a number(69) from the ticket machine, they overhead counter read 29!\nIf this wasn't bad enough, two windows were open and one employee occupying the right window was actually sitting down at the service counter reading a NEWSPAPER, while literally dozens of vets were waiting patiently to be seen.  Are these the kind of employees the Phoenix VA have as support staff? God help us all."
2,"Since my last horrible gel nail experience at a previous salon (they ended up lasting about 4 days people) my nails needed help. The last manicure left the gel polish peeling, to which I stupidly kept picking at which isn't good for your nails. I decided to go to Q Nails, which I used to go to years ago when I had acrylics. \n\nThe place looks the same, although they are doing some renovations in the back to increase the space for facials.\n\nI told the nail tech I had gel nails done at another salon and lasted only 4 days, she said theirs last 2-3wks. ok, go for it. \n\nShe started by cleaning off what was left of my old gel polish and shaping the nail. I wasn't crazy about how she shaped them....but I'll come back to that. \n\nSo she then left and Tony took over. He had just finished working with a woman who apparently has been coming to him for 6 years and supplies all the magazines in the salon (she brings in her old ones). Ok, so he must be good if she keeps coming back. \n\nI opted again for the french gel manicure. He did a slightly different technique from what I saw before and made sure to allow the polish to cure under the light for the set time (the light turned off when time was up for each coat). \n\nIt's only been 4 days but so far no signs of chipping-and I don't baby my hands so this stuff needs to hold up with everything I do. The shape doesn't look bad with the polish on, and I think once they get a little longer they'll look even better. Gel manicure $21, Gel french manicure $26. They accept credit cards but you cannot add the tip so bring cash for that. \n\nMy reason for 3 stars only is just for the question of cleanliness. I saw him putting tools away when he was done after my manicure....and he hadn't cleaned them. So I'm assuming they hadn't been cleaned prior to my manicure......."
2,"I recently signed up with Gold's and have already found my 3 gyms that I have already became a regular at.  But that doesn't mean I won't drive around town checking the other Gold's out.  I decided to give this gym a try since it is fairly close to home.  \n\nI was immediately disappointed with just the size of this gym.  My second impression, this gym is stuffy and lacking ventilation.  I came in on a Saturday night and there was about 10 other gym goers doing their thing.  This gym is so small that even with less than 15 of us in the gym, it felt crowded.  This gym is lacking a lot from equipment to free-weights.  There's only one of everything here which means you have to wait just to get on a bench.  I just can't imagine what it's like on Monday around 5 PM.  \n\nCardio is located upstairs and the ventilation is even worse.  You almost feel like you're doing cardio in an attic up there. The gym tried fixing this issue by placing a few commercial fans up there, but it's not enough.  Perhaps this could be perfect for someone wanting to burn a ton of calories during cardio since it feels like it's over 100 degrees up there. \n\nI'm glad I gave this place a try.  Now I know that this is one of those Gold's that I plan on avoiding in the future.  Still giving them 3 stars because it is a gym and I still managed to get a great workout."
4,"This place continues to amaze me, the screaming is awesome......what is really great is the leftovers after a couple days....even better...the flavors are unlike any others anywhere, fabulous....."
3,"Pretty cool place for dancing. The bartenders are quick and very professional, they can make you any cocktail you can only imagine. Like the patio area with Paris view. Had an amazing time with my girlfriend."
3,We travel to Mexico a lot.  Just got back from the tip of Baja.  These tacos taste like Baja tacos.  Great stuff!  Very clean and staff is nice.  Went 2 nights in a row.
1,"Not really my favorite sub shop. It's extremely plain. I mean, there's like literally no flavor. Not sure why everyone thinks this place is so great. \n\nAt least they're quick. Your food is ready by the time you're done ordering. Oh and good luck getting delivery. I hope you live next door, because that's as far as they deliver! Seriously, I live 1.5 miles away, and they don't deliver."
0,"At first, I thought I was going to have a great experience here.  They had great items ranging from wines to great decor for the biggest alcoholic and wine enthusiast in the city; however, my night was completely spoiled by the extremely rude and unpleasant ladies who were working.\n\nAs a newly turned 21 year old, I have grown accustom to showing my ID, and I do not mind doing it one bit.  I know the law, and I would never risk a business being fined by serving an underager.  However the ladies were extremely rude when demanding I show ID first before even looking at a wine.  Then, after showing my ID to the one nice ladies, the others looked over and saw me drinking and lost her mind.  She was obviously too busy with her computer to see I had already been carded.  Her redundancy about the fines that would be given if they served me underage were rather annoying and uneccasary.  \n\nToo bad the staff was so rude because we were about to buy some wine and a few decorations."
1,"Great atmosphere & great beer but it took 45 minutes to get our food. When I walked in I was immediately impressed. Crowded restaurant on a Friday night, a great sign. There was a guitarist playing & the place was buzzing. The waitress recommended getting the beer sampler & I wasn't disappointed. The Dirty Blonde Ale & the Heffeweisen in particular were fantastic. When my friend arrived we ordered food & begin to chit chat & have a good time. After about a half hour we began to wonder where our food was. When the waitress started to avoid us we knew something was wrong. Finally after 45 minutes our food arrived.  My burger was decent but a little dry; it certainly wasn't the medium rare that I had ordered & it was definitely not worth the wait but after 45 minutes and some beer sampler I really needed some food. The waitress said they were unexpectedly busy. I may give them another chance just to see if she was right or if they've worked out their kitchen issues....& to try the beer again."
4,"We were idiots and didn't rent a car at the airport and after calling around this was the closest place in Downtown with the best prices. But then I checked Yelp and got pretty scared but alas our reservation was already booked so what's a girl to do? Well, I went ahead and checked it out for myself and I was very happy with my experience I felt a more recent review needed to be written on here. The small desk sits in the Golden Nugget hotel and it's very easy to miss but just ask someone and they can tell you where it's at. The clerk was so helpful and even helped me avoid the airport return fee by having us sign up for roadside assistance thus saving us $7, hey that's half a cocktail on the Strip right? Anyway, check out was easy and fast. The car we received was clean and the employee who did our inspection was very thorough. Since this was our first time renting a car, ever, the front desk clerk really helped us understand how it all worked and I felt I in good hands. If you can remember to rent a car at the airport it's usually cheaper but this was a great alternative and not much higher in price."
1,shitty pizza.. shittier customer service.. do your self a favor and order from Big Boy's. Bitch.. I am a customer. Don't get all snotty with me on the phone for asking questions about your specials.
3,"Wood paneling, a great (though expensive wine list), and a Goodfellas feel to this hidden gem that has been in business for 35 years.\n\nAn above average selection of pasta standards including squid ink fettuccine, and pesto made with basil so fresh it took on a different flavor.  The beer selection is poor, however the above average wine list made up for it.\n\nMany varieties of scalopini, soups and fresh seafood, makes this more than just a pasta joint.\n\nService is friendly and professional.  I will be back."
3,"This place proves that it's worth giving someone a second chance. The first time I went there for dinner, I ordered the oxtail soup, but it was so-so, and I dismissed Atti as just another fancy-looking Asian restaurant place downtown. Several months later, my colleagues found out that at lunchtime their menu is half price and they quickly started going there on a regular basis, after which they wouldn't stop gushing about how delicious the beef ribs were. That convinced me to go back, and since then I've been a fan! The beef ribs are indeed a winner. Sweet, tender and come in a generous portion! The complementary side dishes - there are usually three of them (kimchi, beansprouts and potatoes cooked in sweet sauce) are also very good.\nNowadays I don't think the lunch time menu is half the price of the dinner menu, but it's still a good value for what you pay for. If I could give just one constructive criticism... there's this guy who's always there, a bit of an all rounder (maybe the manager, maybe the owner?), he's efficient and all, but could definitely use a smile. I know it's not just me. My colleagues have also commented the same. If you're going there for lunch, best to make a reservation as it's often full-house."
4,"OMG SO GOOD! Get the all-you-can-eat sushi! Unlike most places, they will give you all you can eat SASHIMI (fish WITHOUT the rice), which is unusual because AYCE places usually want you to fill up on rice--not this place! Sit at the sushi bar and the chefs are really cool! Oh and if you are a \""good looking lady\"" and you go in after midnight, you get a discount. Can't remember how much, but still kind of funny."
4,"This place has been reviewed a lot, obviously, so I'll keep it short and sweet with a list.\n\nPros:\nThe vegetarian Pho is amazing. I will only have eyes for it when I go there, and maybe a fresh veggie spring roll. Unlike two of the other reviewers who had some sour grapes over their experience, I have multiple resources that the veggie Pho broth is vegan.\nCheap. Huge bowl of Pho with fresh veggies and a drink for under $10. \n\nCons:\nParking in this neighborhood is a racket and restaurant doesn't have a lot.\n\nGood to know:\nNo credit. Take cash, or use the ATM in the vestibule.\nAtmosphere is hole-in-the-wall. If you can't cope with that, get takeout or don't go."
4,Great place. Gotta have Nick as your chef. We had dinner real late and service was awesome. EveRything there is good from chicken to the lobster to the sake. You will have a great time. Just watch your wallet cause it can GET EXPENSIVE! LOL
3,"We drove 25 minutes to get to this place based on the Yelp reviews.  It was definitely worth the trip.  We were greeted and seated very quickly, and ordered the fresh orange juice which was very good.\n\nBetween the whole family, we had eggs, pancakes, an omelette, bacon, and sausage.  Everything was pretty good, and we had a great time and enjoyed the excellent service.  We went on a Wednesday morning around 10 and it was about half full.\n\nThe bill with the tip was 52 bucks for four of us, which was a little pricey, but we enjoyed ourselves so I would say that's the point.  Sure, we could have gone to McDonald's for 12 bucks, but that isn't really the point.\n\nWe were on vacation and it was fun to go to a new place."
4,"Stopped here twice on a business trip. Great selection of local beer (I'm a craft beer enthusiast from NH). I kept getting beer samplers, they were served on a board shaped like Wisconsin. Fried cheese curds were great. Highly recommend the number 30, the egg on a burger sounds weird but is to die for! Friendly waitstaff, (beer) knowledgeable server."
4,cute place. great food!
1,"Oh Dean & Deluca!  What happened to you?  You USED to have the BEST cupcakes in the world -- the chocolate raspberry cupcakes were simply out of this world.  Today, I can't believe I paid $3.50 for a cupcake which is, quite possibly, worse than anything I've ever gotten in a grocery store or out of a box.  The cupcake was half the size, dry, and the frosting tasted as if it came straight from the can.  Only the price was the same.  Shame on you, D&D!  I expected better!"
4,Had a water heater go out. The Rocky Mountain Restoration team got my home looking back to normal in no time. Very grateful for their help.
1,"I've been to Francesca's five or six times, because my friends really like to eat there.  I'd never choose to eat here myself.  They change the pasta and entree menu frequently, which normally I like.  Each time I've been to this restaurant, the menu has been different.  Each time, however, the menu seems kind of all-or-nothing.  I either can't decide what to order, or nothing sounds appealing.  \n\nI've ordered the pizza when none of the pasta appealed to me, and won't make that mistake again.  The crust somehow managed to be chewy and hard at the same time.  My jaw hurt from eating it.  The cheese was good, but I haven't licked the toppings of pizza since I was five.  The salads are small and I'd have to order three of them to be satiated.  \n\nAs I mentioned, I've either loved the pasta dishes or not wanted to eat them at all.  Fortunately, I can bring anything home to my boyfriend!  The portions are huge, so if I like something I eat half it for dinner and bring the rest home for the lunch the next day.  When I don't like something, I eat two bites and bring the rest home.\n\nI don't eat meat (or chicken or seafood), and I think you can learn a lot about a \""chef\"" when you ask a dish to be made without meat.  At Francesca's they don't seem to know what to do with this request, which causes me to suspect things are made up ahead of time.  I've tried ordering pasta without meat and then have to order entirely different sauces.  I've not been able to order any of the entrees, as they are all animal-flesh based.\n\nI don't agree with the reviews on here raving about Francesca's wine list.  It's the same as you'd find at any liquor store that isn't located within a grocery store.  I'd rather stay home and drink the whole bottle for less than the price of two glasses at a restaurant.  \n\nIt'd be nice if they'd update their menu online, so I'd know whether to eat a snack before going or not."
4,"I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS SHOW. \n\nPlain and Simple.\n\nIt was AWESOME. \n\nLoved the interpretations, the symbols, the movements, the music, the costumes, the comedic relief. Zumanity showed all the different sides & angles in \""sex\""\n\nCant wait to go a 2nd time. This time Front Row Booth baby!"
1,"I wanted to love PastaBAR, as I love all of it's selling points (downtown, late night, fresh local ingedients, small plates).  But I didn't.\n\nIn a word: underwhelming.  The portions are elegant.  The prices would be perfectly fair if the food rocked.  But everything seemed underseasoned, stark and lacked depth of flavor.  There is simple food, which I dig, but this seemed austere.\n\nI will go back and sample other dishes: I need this place!"
4,I have only had their saag / palak paneer one time but it has never tasted better!!! I try this dish at every Indian joint and this is by far the BEST Indian meal I have ever had. \nI wish I lived closer so I could eat it on a regular basis.
2,Went there last night for their monthly free planetarium show. It was a really cool show that was unfortunately set to Pink Floyd music. After the show the science dept professors had a huge telescope set up and we were able to look at the moon. First friday of every month!
3,"This is a great hotel in a perfect location. Also, don't miss dinner at the Steak and Grill Restaurant. We normally avoid hotel restaurants, but our first night there were were soaked and cold and could not face going outside. The food was local, perfectly prepared, and all around fabulous. We spent the next day looking at menus around town and came back to the Steak and Grill for a second night. Prices were comparable with other places and the food would be hard to beat."
3,"Very good food and service! High recommend the prime rib sandwich, the best I have ever tasted!"
2,About as pretentious as it gets in Scottsdale. Dark and noisy. Expensive drinks. Not really my kinda a place. But if you're into that kind of thing...
1,"Im rewriting my review on this place for 2 reasons. First, because the first time I came here was back in 2009. Second, when I came here the most recent time, it was not like my first. Im gonna make this short and simple for you non readers. The burger was tasteless. I understand the reason for the unlimited amount of toppings you can add to your burger. But even A-1 steaksauce, chipotle sauce and banana peppers cant hide the taste of dry ground beef. Come on Cheeburger, even Chili's has their own flavor!!! I was very disappointed when I came back here, but im over it now since I wont be back again."
1,"Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left  a booths seat  dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it.  Servers's aprons mostly are dirty. Bathroom are disgusted.\n\nIf you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste... I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back."
3,"We had came here on our last day.  We were just about to leave town when our friend, who also drove, told us to come here.  Apparently he's been coming here for ten years so we trusted him.\n\nI usually skip buffets [although there's this all-u-can-eat Korean BBQ that's to die for in Chinatown!] since I don't eat my money's worth but I had no problem here.  Everything was fresh and refreshing.  I'm glad we came here for lunch.  Every time I went out for another plate [only three plates], there would be a new item.  It's quite exciting!\n\nOn the way out, I grabbed my second ice cream cone.  The first one was green tea.  My second one was red bean.  All that milk had me out like a lamp on the way home!\n\nI will definitely come here again.  After all, I think my other friend wants to have her wedding reception here!"
2,"if you don't feel like eating the pho at treasure island and you are in need of a massive hangover cure, i would definitely venture out here to have some authentic pho.\n\nthe pho at pho vietnam wasn't the best i ever had and the cha gio (eggrolls) were oddly pale even though they were fried.  the iced coffee came already prepared rather than from a slow drip.  this is a good place to come if you have a large party and you don't want a wait.  it's also in the same plaza as ranch 99."
4,"This review is long overdue! After catching \""year long disaster\"" opening for \""Foo Fighters\"", we literally stumbled into the Pink Taco. Convienance is #1 especially after the concert was over. We both had way too many drinks at the show and were starving. So we guided by the crowd into the PT and found 2 open seats at the bar. I had water since for the last 3 hours, I was fighting to keep my drink down. I normally don't drink that much at concerts for fear of fumbling my lunch. So we order green chicken enchilada's and 7ups. These were the best I ever had. No Joke. My Abuelita was replaced in about 45 minutes of feasting on these bad boys. Beans and rice was as authentic as I ever had in East LA or at home. Sure, I was drunk off my ass but the favor was on! Mucho Saludos a los cocineros. There may be better \""Mexican\"" food places, but if your catching a show at the Hard Rock. Stop by and have a plate of \""the best I ever had\"" green chicken enchilladas. Next time, we are staying at the HRC since we stayed at MGM. That was a long ass walk but the things you do when you got \""LONG ISLAND ICED TEA BALLS\"". If you don't agree, I will meet you at the 10fry & Soto St and throw down for my honor! hahahha Keep on yelping."
0,"Shut down by the Health department on April 5th because of 52 demerits.\n\n\""Inspectors found spoiled and contaminated food, food that wasn't properly cooled, food stored at improper temperatures and so much more. Even the thermometers weren't working properly and the restaurant's previous grade cards weren't visible.\"" \n\nThis would make me very worried about any future visits while downtown and very glad that my few previous visits didn't end badly."
2,This place is okay.  The crepes are pretty good.  I've had the turkey and avocado one and a veggie one.  The spinach salad with dried cranberries and almonds has a poppy-seed dressing that is way too sweet.  I guess I should I ask for it on the side.
0,"This was a brightly lit place with a trailer feel that had table clothes on tables that filled a plain rectangular single room.  There was plenty of help running around ignoring the four of us for a bit and then the excitement started when we ordered and was told how many things they did not have like bacon, cheddar cheese and the like.  It was a \""steak place\"" and they proved it by charging between $25 and $37.  We had a bad enough feeling about the place and didn't chance that by just ordering hamburgers and fries and with a drink each that came to $31.  Flavor probably would have been extra.  Go anywhere also."
4,"My husband and I were in the area and checked out local breakfast places on Yelp! They had good reviews so we decided to check it out. The place is tucked away in one of those shopping centers, but is very cute and welcoming! The food was great and the coffee was hot! The servers were friendly and kept my coffee cup full! We aren't in this area often, but we will be back! :)"
0,What Idiot designed the seating in this joint? Amateur Dancers? I could have went to the local Strip joint and saved my money instead of wasting it on this flawed crap! What a rip off? Touristy at best! I could have brought my Grand mother and she would not have been ashamed. I think Miley Cyrus has a bigger ass then all those Girls put together? Fake Boobs and No Asses!...........and no routines to make memorable. I think I saw more of the back of the head of some Japanese Tourist? The Comedian was not that bad. That is pretty much where the one star comes from.
0,This starbucks is awful. They don't listen when you're ordering don't apologize for having to repeat yourself 5 time. Their rude and unworthy of my business.
3,"The faux cobblestone floors in this bad boy are being replaced with super slippery tiles (gray and black). Upside? You can see up people's skirts in the reflection. Downside? Forget about traction when you walk in. I wore some flip flops and walked in the entrance near Sephora, nearly fell flat on my ass, and was told by the Sephora security guard that happens daily. So be careful, wear sneakers, and take a strong person with a good sense of balance along with you.\n\nLots of decent shopping with some crazy stores thrown in. A little disorienting when you're walking thru, because it's shaped in kind of a circle. I think I walked thru about 10 times trying to find the restrooms. Oh, the restrooms are nice, and have private little stalls. Good potty break area. Lots of good restaurants."
0,"This store discriminates against customers who may have problems carrying items since you are not allowed to take a cart out.  Why is that?  Target next door lets you take your cart to your car, are they discriminating against the Ross clientele (I've seen a review calling this store \""ghetto.\"" I see no difference in Target and Fry's customer base and Ross'.  I did go there because a friend had gotten a good deal on a furniture accessory but then realized I couldn't carry it to my car because of back issues.   I did mention this to security..he said I could drive up (that's a very busy area),I also mentioned it to the cashier and when a very nice man heard me he offered to carry it out to the car.  Also the wait was long because they shut down one register so the cashier could stack up hangars!  so hangars are more important than a line of customers. most of the store was dirty, disorganized, lacking price tags, etc.  never again!"
2,"Kind of gimmicky, but fun. My husband ordered Viennese coffee (he said it was perfect) and I ordered Viennese hot chocolate, which was served lukewarm! I would have complained, but the servers were so busy that I decided to suck it up. The hot chocolate itself was nice, very thick and chocolaty. I would like to go back and try some of their crepes, especially the salted caramel one."
2,"I stopped in here for lunch today, joined this time by friends Shelley M. & Arlin B.  Here's the long and short of it:\n\n*  The food they serve here tastes great!  (That's one thing, isn't it?)\n\nHOWEVER:\n\n*  The first time I came it was freezing cold inside!\n\n*  The second time I came it was roasting hot inside!\n\n*  This time it was freezing cold inside!\n\n*  The service wasn't as friendly this time as during my previous visits.\n\n*  Our food all arrived on one tray, & it was up to us to try to figure out what was what.\n\n*  They usually give each diner a little tray of cooked onions, peppers, plus lemon & lime slices, but this time we only received two of these trays for the three of us.     :-(\n\nThe temperature should be controlled better in here, & it's important for the counter & table service to remain friendly, as it was before!\n\nMy order this time was for...\n\nCarne Asada (beef) Taco:  $1.25\nAl Pastor (pork) Taco:  $1.25\nPescado (fish) Taco:  $2\nBeef Tamale:  $2"
4,"LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL! After experiencing this festival, this is how you will feel. It's better than any artificial high you can buy. A magical gathering of people infused with a plethora of art, culinary delights, learning, and live music. \n\nI've been to several music festivals: big and small. Life Is Beautiful is my all-time favorite. Imagine a 3-day festival in the heart of historic downtown Las Vegas. It makes navigating the space a cake walk because it's set up on a grid. The two main stages were on opposite sides of the grounds; each with a separate culinary village attached.\n\nI'm not really sure what the parking nightmare was like, thankfully my sister works downtown and let me borrow her parking pass at a structure near downtown; although Saturday night I was camped in the garage for 2 hours. Since this festival is in the heart of downtown, my group of friends grabbed some beers (and I a lemonade) at Park on Fremont and see-sawed for a bit.\n\nBeing that this Festival is still in it's infancy, being only it's second year there are still kinks that need to be worked out. The motivational speakers were crammed into this small space. Lining up for 30 minutes prior to a session and not being able to get in was beyond frustrating; however, I got over it quickly. My best festival memories come from getting lost in the experience rather than rushing to catch a certain set. \n\nMy favorite memory was the ferris wheel ride on night 3. We were the first loading on, as soon as we made a full 360, Foo Fighter started. One of those, what is life moments. I love taking in the views from on the top of the solo ride. Overlooking the entire festival. Seeing all the people there, all experiencing the same thing, you can't help but feel connected to your fellow ladies and gents. I'm still smiling from my memories made there.\n\nCan't wait to go back!"
4,"Excellent job!  Originally went to take a friend and was so impressed with that work that I had them do mine.  Will go back and refer friends.  Chris is friendly, professional and thorough. Car looks great!!!!"
3,"Good space. Has all the equipment you need. Only problem is too many personal trainers. Its a public gym, NOT a personal training studio!"
4,"CC Sizzle on a sopapilla was awesome.  Like a super flavorful puffy taco.  The wife had the chicken tacos and mentioned the fresh tasting corn tortillas.  We also got a cheese quesadilla and chips and salsa.  Everything was fantastic. \n\nAlso, the guy and lady working there were super nice and polite the whole time, major points for that.  I'll be returning."
4,Fun...great service and great food...One of Phoenix's most unique and fun dining destinations.
3,"It was my first time in Vegas and the Luxor was pretty cool. The staff was supper friendly and quick at what they do. The bathrooms are a little outdated with weird wall paper and little pyramid shapes to them. The rooms are pretty quiet, you can't hear your neighbor. The pool looked cloudy and there were too many people in the pool for my comfort level so I did not even bother. The view from the 9th floor to the atrium was amazing and the view from our pyramid room was pretty nice facing Mandalay bay and the airport. \nThe reason why the elevator shakes a lot is because the elevator is traveling across the pyramid. Its not like a typical elevator that goes up and down, its traveling diagonally. \nThe luxor should take better care of the outside of the pyramid by cleaning the windows because it looks a little dusty. The hotel has a great design to it and its a shame to see it look shabby. The beam on top of the pyramid is pretty impressive. I suggest they should put light beams out of sphinx eyes that would be cool to see. Overall its a good place to stay on a budget in vegas. \nMy final opinion of vegas overall I discovered that most of the vegas hotels smell like sewer not just the Luxor."
3,"went to smash-burger on sat night.  the food was really excellent if not a little messy.  i had the arizona smash and fries.  the fries were a great surprise ...lightly flavored with garlic and rosemary yummm.  and you got plenty to share (which i did).  i kept looking at the menu, it's limited but they seem to have everything i could have wanted and a burger joint.  i would go back till i tried it all.  we shall see.  check this place out."
1,"I suppose its my fault for 1) expecting waaaaay too much from this place and only because it happens to be located in Aria, the newest hotel on the strip & 2) for being a bit too buzzed and extremely hungry to choose my dish without any real thought of what I was getting here.....\n\nMe, the boyfriend, and his friend had a quick dinner here before hitting the casino floor to win back some or our hard earned money.  The server came by and took our drink orders: 2 jack & cokes (for me and my bf's friend) and a ketel cran (for my bf).  After we, including the server,  all shared a quick laugh about a random thing and sensing that our server was pretty cool, I boldly asked him that our drinks be served super strong.  He chuckled and slyly smiled, and suggested, \""oh you mean a double shot?\"" To which I eagerly replied, \""hell yes.\""  He proceeded to take our orders: I ordered the steak with fries, my bf ordered from the 'build your own pasta,' section and his friend ordered a club sandwich with fries. Our drinks came in no time and our server quickly left. One sip of our drinks indicated not only was there NO double shot, it hardly tasted like there was any liquor in there :( Worse yet, the aftertaste was horrible which led me to believe the small amount of liquor that was being used was just house liquor. \n\nWe set our drinks aside and proceeded to grub on our meals when they were placed in front of us 30 minutes later.  The french fries were goood and I gobbled them up with a side of ranch in no time. My steak was semi warm, leading me to believe it had been sitting out a bit too long after it was cooked (and that's assuming my steak was cooked to order instead of sitting under a heat lamp).  It was a nice sized steak, but the way it was cooked (way too done) and the lack of seasoning didn't do it for me. I finished half of it out of sheer hunger and left the other half on the plate.  My bf loved his pasta which looked good...he basically ordered chicken fettucine with alfredo sauce. While he left to go to the bathroom, I snuck a few forkfuls into my mouth. His friend also liked the fries and said his club sandwich wasn't bad and tasted like any other club sandwich he'd tasted at other places.\n\nThe bill came back higher than what we expected.  After reviewing the charges, we realized our 'cool server' actually charged us each for the double shots in our drinks. *&!@#  Ok slick ass taking advantage of friendly and buzzing customers!!  Had we known that by him suggesting a 'double shot' that we would've actually gotten charged for another drink, I wouldn't have agreed to it.   My bf and his friend were also in disbelief of the charges.  However they didn't want to make an issue out of it, in case it ruined any of our gambling luck at the tables (they're superstitious like that) and paid the bill. They must've been right cuz I came up $200 at a roulette table shortly afterwards :)\n\nSo...in a nutshell I wouldn't willingly come back here again.  The food is mediocre and overpriced (even without the double shots that were charged to our bill).  However, if I happen to come back here (not by choice, but by circumstance) I'd probably order pasta or breakfast items since those are relatively simple."
1,"This place is quite a paradox....\n\nYou almost have to love to hate it...\n\nWhy do I say this?\n\nThe FOOD is terrible....\nThe bread is soggy, the sandwiches uneventful..the burgers bland...and the fries are pedestrian...\n\nThe amenties are average picnic tables w/bad wood booths...\nTHe prices are high for what you get...\n\nSo why would you LOVE it?\n\nThey have some INCREDIBLY hot girls who work there...\n\nMy high school friend who's still a bachelor would LOVE\nthis place.  \n\nThese girls are all his cup of tea.\n\nALL of the girls are young, wispy, curvy and pretty...\nProbably 5'1-5'5\"" walking around in form fitting outfits\nw/long straight hair...and perfectly tanned faces w/incredible\nfeatures.\n\nNot just ONE..but ALL of them are like that.\n\nIs this where the girls who didn't make the Carolina Panther cheerleader squad work?  At least they must be the little sisters of the panther cheerleaders.\n\nYOu will see LOTS of pervy looking silver haired men in this place..pretending like they like the food..\n\nIt's too bad the girls have no idea how to be servers..\n\nI ordered a roast beef sandwich but instead of getting what I want..I was forced to get what the girl wanted me to order...it was like a jedi mind trick!\n\nMe \""I'd like a cold roast beef, w/some dip on the side\""\nHer \""So you want the au jou...\""(scolding me)\nME \""Um..not really..I wanted the vegetables on the cold sandwich\""\nHer \""You can get that but it's still an au jou\""\nME \""Okay...I guess?\""\nHer \""Yes..so you are getting the au jou\""\n\nSO she gives me the roast beef Au Jou and of course\nI got no lettuce tomatoes etc as I requested.\nI didn't even want to bother to correct her..\n\nI could tell it wasn't getting through.\n\nJust stand there honey..in your skin tight leggings, ugg boots\nand form fitted sweater and smile.\n\nThat's why guys spend 10-20 dollars in here.\n\nAt least this isn't frowned upon like it is in California and is actually CELEBRATED here in Charlotte.\n\nPretty girl who can't do much..serving you bad food!"
3,"We've picked up takeout a few times and had them deliver once.  The pizza is really very good.  I like their thin crust, it's nice and crispy and the sauce has a good flavor.  My husband tried the chicken parm today, it's a big sandwich with nice quality chicken and he thought it was delicious.  After our first pie, we decided that the pizza was somewhere between MA and NJ style pie, it turns out the owner is from CT.\n\nDelivery was fast but they have good parking here and it's incredibly convenient to be able to run into the grocery store around the corner while you're waiting.\n\nIt's a typical store front pizza place with a limited menu, nothing fancy.  The pizza is 18\"" and freezes/reheats perfectly.  As with most places, the slices from  a full pizza are better than the slices sold individually so you're better off getting a whole pizza - at least the first time."
2,"I'm giving this 3 stars for atmosphere only. I'd like it if they had a great martini menu but they don't, just a handful of sweet martinis made with Sprite. I do go on occasion for happy hour and have never been satisfied with the young unexperienced wait staff.  Whenever I go for happy hour I get a half price martini, once the waitress had no idea what I was talking about as far as specials and half price martinis and had to go ask before she confirmed. Tonight I ordered a cucumber martini, not on the menu, but it's not like I asked for something completely obscure and I got pure vodka with slices of cucumber, sent that back. Tonight, on a Friday night I'd think they'd have more experienced bartenders but they were 3 young females that I'd bet money were all younger than 22. The sushi and food is not that impressive. I actually don't believe you will find good sushi in Charlotte anyway. I've lived in larger metro areas and traveled extensively in Asia. I'm not holding Charlotte to really high standards since I'm sure the sushi chefs are not on the dock getting fresh caught fish at midnight, you know, since we are in Charlotte. It's also kinda pricey overall too. Really, it's a classy place to go and it's not like there's alot of other options in Charlotte."
0,"Walked in to the store and security guard demanded to show him my reusable bag, so I did. After not finding to buy because the seafood and meat did not look that good I walked out and offered to show the woman at self check to look inside my bag she lets me go. Than calls me back asking if I had walked in with it and I might be doing something funny with it. That I also should have left it there at self check. Last time I left a reusable bag at a store it was gone, so I will not be back to this store!"
3,"My husband's family took us to a concert at the Jobing.com arena. We needed somewhere close to eat. All restaurants were swamped from concert goers, but when we walked up to the packed Yard House, they were very accommodating and we took their last table outside. Thankfully on a hot summer day, the misters and prompt service of water made everything okay.\n\nWhile the restaurant was totally full, our waiter never seemed stressed and checked in on us often. He was very knowledgeable about all the beers and even provided our table with a sample.  I tried a happy hour martini. I would never not pay happy hour prices for their drinks. It was okay, but I think if I am ever there again, I would just get a glass of wine (since I don't drink beer)\n\nAs for the food, I chose their 4 cheese pizza which was on happy hour pricing. It was 11 inches and only 6 dollars and change! What a deal and a yummy pizza to boot! I decided to add pepperoni onto it. Each topping is 1.00. My husband and his sister had burgers which were some of the best I have tried. Be warned that their BBQ sauce is on the sweeter end, but all sauces for your burgers are on the side. Their fries are those yummy thin fries that make it easy for you to eat a lot of them. Members of our table also ordered a Cobb Salad which was good and Jambalaya. If you can't make it to New Orleans, this will do the trick!\n\nI would have given this place a three if it wasn't for the pizza (especially with the amazing happy hour price) and the burgers. So I say come during happy hour."
3,"I absolutely love this place.  I've been going since they opened, and forgot about them for a while.  Now I took my boyfriend and he's addicted to Fluffy Snow.\n\nFood Reviews:\nPopcorn Chicken - The best I've ever had\nFish Ball- Not good in my opinion, more of a texture thing I guess.  The outside has the same seasoning as the popcorn chicken, but the inside of the ball...It's more of a fish cake texture.  I was expecting something more like batter with fish chunks in it.\nChicken Wings- Still covered in the same seasoning as all the other food, which is quite tasty.  They were kind on the soggy side and the skin was all squishy and not crisp enough for my taste.  It also looked a little pink close to the bone which grossed me out.  I ended up putting them under the toaster oven"
4,"This is the best place for burritos in Charlotte.  Particularly recommend the vegetarian burrito.  Great atmosphere, cool staff and music, easily accessible from downtown, Dilworth, and South End.  As good as any burritos I've had in cities known for their burrito- like food, including LA."
0,"The star is for the server. When I go to a restaurant above all the food should be the star of the show. The food was mediocre at best. My children shared a $9.95 bowl of buttered spaghetti and received a cereal bowl of plain pasta, completely overpriced. Service took way to long, over an hour from appetizers to entrees. When the food did come out it was either half cold and rubbery (chicken). They ran out of wine that we ordered and gave us excuses that they were really busy. It was 8:00 and the restaurant was empty. We absolutely will not go back. Sad really, the neighborhood really welcomed a cool place to walk to and have good food."
4,"Been here a few times because I was too lazy to drive to my regular soho a few more miles down. Was in and out so I never really took the place in. Then one day I heard they had a salad bar and I had to go back. I didn't even remember seeing one my first few visits. When I get there I heard a choir and I laid my eyes on said salad bar not to mention gelato, pizza,sushi, you name it. Crazy I missed it. This place is awesome. Salad bat was even better than whole foods. Very clean and well kept. Music in the background makes u feel like you're shopping in a movie. I keep getting the loopy cashier who just loves to talk about her plans once she's free. Can't stay away from this place. Dukedom here I come"
3,We checked this place out because of positive reviews on Yelp.  This looks like a real find.   We did take out and it was all very good.   The food came out very quickly too and it was handed to me by the owner.  I knew this because of the news articles posted at the front restaurant that tells about how the restaurant came to Madison and its owners immigrated from China to America years ago etc.  It is an interesting story. \n\nWe will be going back for full service sometime soon and I expect my rating to go up as I think this is a hidden gem in a very unassuming location.
4,"After seeing many pictures and check-ins for Sweet Addiction, I was determined to check out this place. When I arrived with my friend their staff immediately greeted us and was very friendly. I order an ice cream cookie sandwich with a chocolate chip cookie and chocolate brownie cookie with vanilla ice cream. It was delicious! It was also very cheap, since they give you 50 cents off your order if you check in on Yelp or Facebook. Overall, I was very pleased with my visit to Sweet Addiction and I can't wait to come back and try their other flavors!"
1,"Came here for restaurant week. I was really excited to try this creative approach to dinning. If you have read other reviews, I'm sure, whoever is reading this, you get the concept of Posh by now. So, here's the thing.... since you cannot decide, as with a regular menu, what dish you would like prepared for you, your chances of liking what you get are 50/50. Bear that in mind, it's probably why half of the reviews are awesome and the other half are people complaining.\n\nNow, I had a very open mind going into this, realzing this fact, that the plates would be beyond my control, but that's not why I'm only giving two stars. The honest to goodness truth is that the cooking just wasn't to par with what you would expect from gourmet dinning. The prices indicate to me that this should be a gourmet experience, as well as the snobbery of the waiters (however, I have expierenced top notch service in other gourmet restaurants...expensive doesn't mean they have to be snobs). There was always something 'missing' from each dish.... they were all very creative, and beautifully presented...but flavors were lacking... I really wanted to be blown away and I sadly wasn't. With that said, I do have to add a note that dessert was exceptional....my favorite out of all the 5 courses.... pinapple sorbet with candied orange rind and strawberry coulis....just phenomenal! But, I don't think that I should have paid 60 bucks for an excellent sorbet and a whole other bunch of bland food. Tack on alcohol to that and my husbands 5 course meal, and suddenly restaurant week didn't seem like such a great discount :/\n\nBottom line, would I go back? No. Would I discourage someone else from going? Not necessarily. It's an interesting experience, and if you feel like blowing 60+ bucks to get that expierence, then, go for it."
4,"Mmmm mmmm good!  The catfish was our favorite, but everything was soooo good.  Get the cornbread!"
1,"Vauge ass's newest hot spot. Friends and I came here over the weekend since Tao didnt like what most of us were wearing. $30 @ the door, full of people dancing to their most extent (It looks funny) Girls trying out the poles looking like they firemen dropping down for emergency. Place is alright, I'm definitely not big on vegas clubs."
0,"I should have followed Yelp's reviews instead of deciding on Dollar's lower rental base price.  They charge for extra drivers, they don't have the car listed on their website, they consider a Chevy Tahoe (Full Size SUV by most other Companies) the same category as a Chevy Suburban (Premium SUV by most other Companies).  \n\nSigned up for the Suburban and given a Tahoe, with not enough room for my travelers and luggage (had to purge some luggage at a relatives home).  This, with the explanation that they consider the Tahoe and Suburban as the same category, and can't do anything about it other than offer me different vehicle that may still not fit my needs.  In addition, the attendants explained that the only Suburban that they have is the one across the parking lot (belonging to the manager!!!!!).\n\n1 star, only because I can't  leave it at ZERO stars!!!!!"
1,The food at this place was quite greasy and lacking flavor. I wouldn't call this place authentic as it's just a lot of fried food with greasy yellow cheese. I do NOT recommend this for visitors looking for authentic Mexican food.
0,"So I wasn't hungry when I dropped in to visit my friend at his storein Chinatown.  But it was lunch time, and they were craving this lamb hotpot that they said was really big and good from this Chinese restaurant I don't know about by their Chinese name.\n\nThe restaurant turned out to be J & J Szechuan Cuisine, which I had bookmarked to try their lunch specials earlier this year.  The interior of the restaurant looks and feels really vintage (not in a good way). But from experience, I know some of the best Chinese food are served at this hole-in-the-wall type restaurants.  After we were seated and handed our menu, my friends proceed to order the Lamb Hot Pot (which they said was off the menu).  Sounds good.  I love the whole secret menu concept.\n\nAfter a fair amount of time has passed and we have completely demolished the appetizers and the Cold Noodle we ordered, the waitress finally brought out the hot pot.  The reaction from my friends was that this was not what they were served on their previous visit. The portion is a lot smaller (as in about half of what they were served the last time).  So instead of it being a hearty large portion that could be split with 3 people, it was just enough to accommodate 2 people at the most.  It was a good thing that I was not hungry to begin with.  The noodle was also cooked so much that you can't even pick it out with a chopstick, as it has pretty much been cooked to mush.  They spoke to the waitress and asked why this did not look like what they ordered previously, but the waitress just argues back saying we do not remember what we ordered the last time.  Considering the portion is less than half of what my friends ordered the last time. And he took pictures of what he ordered from his previous visit. I highly doubt that. Smh.\n\nWhen they asked if it can be returned, since it was so different from what was served before, the waitress just said no!\n\nTo add insult to injury (or is it injury to insult? I wonder which is worst) one of my friend found a random string from who knows what in the Lamb Hot Pot.  We should have taken a picture of it first.  Because when we showed it to the waitress, she dismissed it as just a piece of noodle (It is right there on our table. Try eating it!). Then she said it was the string from the noodle package and just picked it up without offering an apology. Yeah, that was about the only smart thing she did. Get rid of the evidence!\n\nSo inconsistency in what is served, even if it is a secret off the menu item, is already a big red flag for me to never return here again. But the fact that a foreign object was found in the food and the customer received the \""No F Given\"" attitude when confronted about it, is just the final nail in the coffin.\n\nSo yeah, even by Asian/Chinese restaurant standards, this place has crap service and subpar food.  Thus probability of return is less than 0.1%.  But in the event of a zombie apocalypse, I will bookmark this place since it will still be low on other people's list of places to scavenge for food. \n\n1 star, because half stars are not supported on Yelp."
4,"I am a self proclaimed foodie and I don't mess around when it comes to food. Basil and Garlic Bistro is the real deal. I have been here three times and have ordered three different dishes, all were fantastic. \n\nThe first time I was here I ordered the meatball sandwich and it was so flavorful, lightly toasted on the outside, the meatballs were perfectly seasoned, the cheese was flavorful and of great quality. I was so full after eating the first half that I saved the other half for dinner. I didn't want to ruin the delicious sandwich by reheating it in the microwave so I turned on the oven and patiently waited to once again experience the intoxicating scent of an almost fresh meatball sandwich. It was just as good as the first bite!"
2,"Good atmosphere, tasty food. This is a fun place to grab a bite to eat and watch a game or two. Decent drink specials - they do a Wednesday night beer roulette."
3,"I have been reading a lot of the other reviews for this place stating that the Red Velvet Cake/Cupcake, upon which this cafe bases its name, is a 150 calorie treat.  Ok, either that is a lie, or I have been WASTING MY LIFE by not going there EVERY DAY.  Because those cakes are fucking delicious, and with the approximate calorie count as a a can of soda? I would gladly drink water henceforth and have dessert.  I will be going there tomorrow.  \n\nOk, real review.  Generally great food.  I've had really good luck with everything I've ordered there. Except for maybe the fries.  They're not so hot.  \n\nFirst, everything on the menu can be made veggie/vegan, but usually at an extra charge. I'm fine with that, but it can add up if you're ordering for a lot of people I guess.  My favorite thing by far (and something that I get an insatiable craving for from time to time) is the vegan buffalo chicken wrap.  It's full of spicy and crunchy and protein-y goodness, all wrapped up in a toasted tortilla.  I also love their fruit lemonades!  I've never had a dessert I didn't like, but the red velvet is my fave.  Did I mention that I'm going there tomorrow to get one? I might just have to pick up a vegan buffalo chicken wrap to go with it.....\n\nWarning: the service is SLOOOOOOOOOW.  Even if you're the only table there.  The owners/managers/servers have always been super friendly to me and very nice and accommodating.  But expect to wait awhile, even if you call in a to-go order.  Also, it's not clear whether they sometimes do table service now (maybe at night?).  Your best bet is to go order at the counter (that's what I always do -- if they're doing table service they will let you know).  But otherwise -- yay!"
1,"For the price that the Stratosphere still charges for you to stay here, you would think you were staying at the Mirage, or Treasure Island. I'm not saying those are top notch hotels on the strip but I can far better justify paying over $100 for a nice room in one of those than $139 in the Stratosphere.\n\nThe novelty of this place truly is its view, which I would only really recommend at night because during the day you see Vegas for the kind of dessert it really is. The night view is amazing, but the restaurant should be skipped because at $$$$ I was expecting my steak to dance for me. It didn't.\n\nThe casino is small and smokey, it's kind of old-ish and in need of renovation and the room really transported me back to the Sahara next door which I though the Stratosphere was a bit above. I think if you get this place for very very cheap, it would probably be an ok stay, despite the fact that it is quite further down the strip and you will have to drive.\n\nOtherwise, just come here for the night view and leave it at that."
4,"Ask if they have Engawa in stock! It's like the muscular part of halibut, and resembles to the texture of squid. Such a delicious savory bite... I'm craving that now. Oh yea and ask for Aya, she introduced me to so many new things, I loved them all! New favorite sushi spot!"
0,"Worst car rental and customer service  experience of my LIFE. \n\nWhen I rent a car a few weeks in advance of my trip, it better be there. My experience began with a 30 min wait in line (at 10pm on a Wednesday). There were only 2 or 3 reps yet a long line of customers. Meanwhile other rental car lines were moving along relatively speedily. But this wasn't what irritated me. \n\nNo, the reason I'm leaving a review is partially to pass the HOUR+ I've been waiting to receive the car that should have been ready for me at my designated pick-up time. I would understand if I was a walk-up customer and there weren't cars available. But how are there not cars available when my reservation was in the system (along with the dozens of irritated customers). This is absurd.  \n\nThe worst part is how flippant the rep was about it - no attempts to remedy the situation, no apologies even. We were also given a 45 min wait time but were told it would likely be much \""sooner.\"" Well it's been 1:15 and still no car.\n\nTo add insult to injury, we noticed that other people who had come after us had gotten their cars and then were given the advice by a fellow sufferer to talk to a rep because they weren't coming out to the waiting area and calling our name as they had promised. She had gotten bypassed and had we not talked to the rep, we would have too. \n\nI will NEVER give business to Hertz again and will be sure to spread the word, starting with this review. If I could, I would rate Hertz  negative 4 stars instead of 1."
1,"I don't know if we went on an off night (I have read other reviews from the night we went that complained about the service as well).  But, to say I was underwhelmed with Bazaar Meat is an understatement.  When we walked in, I was blown away.  It's a dark and very chic looking place.  There is a small casino to your left as you walk in.  I can't believe other restaurants haven't thought of this, it's such a fantastic idea.  I've seen them in clubs, but not restaurants.  Waiting for your table, how about dropping a hundred at roulette?  \n\nThe hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away.  We had drink orders taken very quickly.  So far, so good.  This place is really an assault on the senses.  There are smells from the grilling, the music is loud, there are alligator heads on the wall, and employees everywhere.  The kitchen is very busy, and you can see most of it from the seating area.  Our server started off friendly, and stayed friendly, but he also stayed away from our table.  This is one of the reasons I am giving 2 stars.  As the meal wore on, he was nowhere to be seen.  It took nearly a half hour to get our check.  Also, a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes.  I know you are crowded, it's a new hot restaurant on the Strip, but these are issues that shouldn't happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge.  Most telling, two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down.  The glasses remained on the table after they were completed, empty, for the entire 2.5 hour meal.  This would have been an easy fix, yet there they remained.  It became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last.  Spoiler alert:  they were on the table when we left.  For all I know, they still are.\n\nAs other yelpers note, the menu is not your typical steakhouse.  It was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place.  I would agree, this is a spot on description.  We started with the Iberico ham, the best ham in the world.  For $70 you don't even get 2 ounces (see my picture), but it's the best HAM IN THE WORLD.  I never regret buying this stuff, and it was no different at Bazaar Meat.  It is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them, sort of a Spanish bruschetta.  The whole thing is fantastic, highly recommended, but it ain't cheap folks.  We next went with the chicken croquettes.  You get 5-6 per order for $12, and they were fantastic.  Fried perfectly and lots of b\u00e9chamel flavor.  Loved these things, I could have easily eaten another order.  \n\nA couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy.  I didn't try it, they ate it so quickly.  I regretted getting one, but we had other things on our mind....\n\nLike the steaks.  Unfortunately, they were out of the Lindsay Ranch ribeye, which of course I'd had my eye on since making the reservation.  As a result, we went with the Mishiwa Reserve, which is $65 a pound.  Supposedly, our steak weighed 2.5 pounds.  Now, I don't carry a scale with me to dinner, but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces.  But, we were hungry, and we ate it rather than complaining.  We did point it out to our server, but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating.  He's absolutely right, but we still weren't happy with the size of this steak.  I don't know, maybe the bone weighs in at 22 ounces or something.  Also, this is the worst dry aged steak I've eaten.  It didn't have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging.  Additionally, it wasn't adequately seasoned.  This was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this.  We ate the steak because we were hungry (and paid an arm and a leg for it), but we weren't happy.\n\nWe also tried the quarter of a suckling pig.  Now we're talking!  This thing was as advertised: juicy, flavorful, with that great crispy skin.  We got as much meat off of the thing as we could, but all of us could have used more.  \n\nFor sides, we went with the Delmonico potatoes, asparagus, and carrots.  All were good, the potatoes were almost too decadent (if such a state exists).  The asparagus is small, but it was cooked well.  I could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce.  The carrots with pepper and Greek yogurt was probably the table favorite.  I'd absolutely get this dish again.\n\nWe were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal.  They, like the rest of the meal, were hit and miss.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in Las Vegas.  I don't know if we went on a bad night (as noted above, I've seen at least one other review that dined the night we did, November 15, 2014, that complained about the service).  I also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues.  But, for what we paid, a lot of the things are close to inexcusable.  I'd return, but not for a long time, and I will definitely bring a scale...."
3,"They seem to be in the middle of a transition, changing the menu to add special entrees and such.\nThe manager was walking around tonight offering patrons random FULL entrees for free, just to try ! That type of atmosphere is what will guarantee my return - goodonya GG."
1,I had the Mackerel and Spicy tuna with a couple of beers and it chimed in for ~$100. Not a good experience from a service standpoint either. The sushi was mediocre at best. \n\nDon't waste your $$$.
3,"The MGM Grand invited me back to stay for a night after my sub par experience last year.  They'd improved in several aspects since my last stay.  The staff was much more polite this time, consistently, and the check in process ran much smoother, notably.  The hotel is still a massive, sometimes over-crowded behemoth, and the valet service is still incredibly slow, but they definitely impressed me more this time than last."
0,The food was good ... the service at this location is HORRIBLE. They are slow never check in with your table and take forever to bring something once you ask for it. Never coming back to this location. Going back to the one on DI their service is amazing and the atmosphere is so much nicer.
3,"Swung by one morning on my way to work. Only had about 15 minutes to browse around. Definitely not enough time to see fully what this place had. From what I could see, they had mostly small wares, although they do have some big equipment as well. The prices were high on some things, low on others. They have rows and rows of small items, that I could not explore this trip, so next time I'll make sure I go when I'm not rushed."
3,"I cannot believe this.  I lived in Chandler for eleven years and never discovered this place until I moved to Tempe for college.  Either way, it's a blessing to the earth.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)\n\n+ Coffee is fresh and never burnt.  I drink lots and lots of this drug, I know what's up.\n\n-/+ Lots of places to sit, but I just can't get comfortable.  It's too bright inside and the music outside is usually too loud.  However...\n\n+ The joint is located on a lake (man-made of course) and it's beautiful.  Once a friend and I passed on the tables and just sat on the edge of the water. Despite the dead fish smell, which wasn't harsh, it was fantastic.\n\n+ The employees always ask how you are doing.  They are quick to make drinks and never get distracted.\n\n+ Prices are below average.  There are a few items that are a tad overpriced, but in a nutshell this is the place to get an inexpensive good time.\n\n+  PUNCH CARD!! As some of you know, I really like punch cards.  Coffee Rush has them.  Get one."
1,"We were hungry and everything else was closed near our gate (except Wendy's, which doesn't count as food in my book), so we ate some chips, salsa, and guacamole here.  My expectations were low, so I wasn't surprised to be unimpressed.\nThe chips came in three colors - Yellow #5, Blue #1, and natural corn color.  The salsa was completely pureed - no chunks at all.  It was more like hot sauce.  Ugh.  The guacamole was pretty flavorless.  This is not my kind of food.\nThe service and atmosphere were quite nice for an airport, however."
1,"This review pertains only to the food and service as we didn't drink. As stated on other reviews the setup is poor and seems to neither serve the dining nor bar crowd well. My wife ordered the bratwurst, only to find out about 15 minutes after ordering it they were out. She settled on the mac n cheese which after an exceeding long wait could only be described as mac n milk. A hostess asked us about our experience and the manager did comp her meal. \nI had the East Vally burger which was fine but nothing special. It sounded better on paper than in reality. The servers while nice didn't seem to be very good, though I will complement the hostesses for being outstanding. As a dining experience I would not recommend the Sleepy Dog though we may not be the clientele they're looking for."
2,"I've been to many Cirque shows and I have to say that this is probably my least favorite.  I came with 3 of my friends, and we all fell asleep during different parts of the show.  It was a little difficult to follow as there was an actual storyline, but they were speaking in their own language which consisted of grunts and weird noises.\n\nThere are visually stunning portions to the show, and the stage itself is just amazing.  But, some of the stunts they did, I had seen done in other shows and quite frankly, they were done better.\n\nRegardless, the costumes are gorgeous, the makeup is intricate, the actors are fun, and the rotating stage is a must see!  They use the stage in so many different ways, it's very creative.  \n\nOne of the highlights was actually the door guy who was dressed as a KA soldier, I believe?  I talked to him, but he wasn't allowed to speak so instead made gestures.  He was friendly and funny, and added to the whole experience of entering into the Cirque world of KA.  I'm very glad that I got to experience KA, but I don't think I will be seeing this show again."
2,"My husband and I were just at this restaurant for dinner last Saturday night.  We go to Las Vegas several times a year and always eat at a highly reviewed restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful with enough atmosphere yet enough quiet places.  Our waitress was really knowledgeable and terrific.  The bread basket was yummy and plentiful....although we would have liked to have been asked if we wanted more.  My mojito and husband's peach margarita were refreshing.  My husband had the chicken (($24) and I had the veal chop ($42).  Mine included a tamale, my husbands just the chicken.  With cocktails at $12-13 things get expensive fast...which we knew.\n\nMy veal chop was really really good as was my husband's chicken.  BUT, when you spend $150 for 2 I really expect to be at the restaurant for 1.5-2 hours....fine dining.  After an hour the busboy came by to clear my plate....I wasn't done and did not intend to be done as this was our evening out.  After the third time I asked him to please stop asking me if I was done.\n\nSo, the price for quantity of food was 25% higher than needed.  The food was excellent. And we disliked being rushed while paying dining prices.  So we will not come back and revisit past restaurants such as 808 at Ceasars."
4,"We love this place, the food is great. Being from the Chicago area it's hard to find good pizza here in az, this is our new favorite place for pizza and wings. The staff is always friendly and helpful."
2,"I have mixed feelings about this practice. I was an OB patient and everything went well with my pregnancy. They did a good job delivering my baby boy. Nothing exceptional but solid. As for my after care it has been awful. I went to a postpartum visit and they said they needed to send in paperwork for my birth control. They said it would take 10 days to be approved. I waited 3 weeks and called back. The secretary said they were still waiting for the paperwork to go through the insurance. I waited 10 days. I called back and the nurse said the paperwork was never sent and she had no idea who I talked to the week before. She basically accused me of never calling. Then she got passive aggressive and said at least she took care of it. One month later?!? And I should be thankful? \n\nThe also never sent in my leave paperwork. It took me a visit, 2 phone calls, and a week for them to take care of that. \n\nSo like I said I am mixed. It was good patient care but the office secretaries and nurses are not as professional. It may just be a couple people but enough to make me consider switching."
3,"We recently met a couple friends for dinner at Casa Rasta on a Friday night. We did not make reservations so we decided to eat outside rather than at the bar (which is now used for seating only as they are BYOB). Everything was going well until it started to rain and we had to attempt to sit a toddler with us at the bar. Make reservations.\nWe started with the chips and guac. I loved that the guac had a nice heat/kick to it. Most guac tends to be bland. I also tried the avocado fries but they were not for me. The creaminess of fried avocado was not a pleasant texture for me though, others at the table liked it. For my entree, I got the flautas. Spicy chicken and onions wrapped in crispy corn shells topped with more guac and onions. The meal came with a side if rice and beans. Overall, I enjoyed the meal. The flautas were tasty but very small for an entree. Other entrees ordered at our table were much larger and contained more meat/fish."
0,"Worst place ever. Not only did they get my order wrong, they didn't put CHICKEN in our chicken sandwich! All it had was cheese and bacon between two buns! Our sodas were filled with ice that the straw would not fit and they were flat. The girl working the drive thru seemed nice, but I would have preferred to have gotten what I ordered."
3,"I've been going to Box for many years. (See my review from their old address on W. Sahara) When they moved I tried other wax places because they were closer to home but it just wasn't the same. I returned to Box, even though Brea's smiling face isn't around as often, it's still a fab place for a waxing. Courtney and Ashley do a great job keeping up the great Box reputation."
4,"Dr. Resnick has provided hands-down the best dental experience I've ever had. Initially, I came to his office with excruciating pain while dreading the financial burden that I knew would inevitably come with solving my dental problems. I was greeted warmly by the office staff and Dr. Resnick's concern was primarily for me and alleviating my pain while assuring me that there were solutions to the financial side of things. In short, he took x-rays, extracted the wisdom tooth that was causing problems and laid out a treatment plan that was surprisingly affordable. Also, he did an amazing job AVOIDING having to do a root canal (and the dollars coming from it) on an adjacent tooth to save me money and pain.  Most importantly, he acted with kindness and empathy throughout my treatment. I'm now, amazingly, a raving fan of a dentist - something I didn't think would result from the agony I was experiencing. Thank you, Dr. Resnick for being a top-notch person AND dentist!"
2,"We came here on Saturday, and good God it was packed. SO many people. Security is very strict, and they comb through your bags. You don't go to these pools to swim, but to stand around, drink, flirt, and splash your unsuspecting neighbors. Don't drink the water for sure! (People liked to let their empty cups and beer bottles float.) When we were here, thug life seemed to be heavily represented (back tattoos and enormous shades for the guys, skimpy jeweled bikinis and heavy eyeliner for the ladies). At one point some dude in one of the poolside VIP areas threw dollar bills into the water... um, what?\n\nDrinks are also Vegas-priced. ($8 for a beer. Just saying.) Don't get me wrong, it was fun. The music was heavy on the hip-hop (lots of fist-pumping and booty-popping to be had), and there's nothing quite like drinking a cold beer with your friends at the pool. But there's no place to leave footwear; everyone piled their sandals near the stairs. We left after a couple of hours because it was just too crowded, but hey, we got our tan on, so it was all good."
3,"The beer selection is fantastic, and the happy hour makes this place a reasonable deal. They also have my favorite beer (hoegaarden w/lemon- if you like hefe-weizens, you should try it).\n\nIt can get overly crowded, and there's usually a long wait for tables. The food is good, but the bar crowd will definitely spill over into the dining section.\n\nFor the most part the staff is friendly, and more down-to-earth than the average vegas place."
4,"I went here with a Meet-up group and had a great experience. The food, service and atmosphere was terrific! We all enjoyed ourselves and will return."
2,Casino: \nA little on the older side but overall great slot machines and table games.  \n\nLove the upgraded modern rooms and the prices are reasonable for being on the strip and centralized to a lot of restaurants and shopping.\n\nThe staff is always nice.
1,"Went here on Saturday because we heard the pizza was good. Pizza's alright. I've had better here in LA. My problem was with the service itself. The woman taking the orders couldn't take orders correctly, she was slow, and she kept disappearing to the back several times making the wait just to order even longer! Horrible! The wait time to get the food was almost an hour! what the fudge? why so long? the point here is that they need more than one overwhelmed filipina at the front taking orders and going crazy looking for lost orders. They need more pizza makers in the back as well to get those pizzas out fast. Oh yeah, we also ordered mild wings and the woman gave us spicy wings  (which I can eat, but friend's wife can't!).  Lame, expensive, and slow. Never again. The only nice people there were the elderly waitress, and the other young woman who made sure we got our wings on time."
3,"I teeter between three and four stars but I will round up in favor of the business. \n\nI had never had gel nails before and I went with a recently heartbroken friend to get gel nails and have some *~*~*GiRl TiMe~*~* before setting off to work that afternoon. I know gel nails are good because they last forever, and my job is very physical and I knew my hopes of regular polish were dashed when I got the job. Gel nails, I will say, are perfect for me because I can bang my hangs around everything and it does not chip whatsoever. I'm definitely a convert in that area!\n\nHowever, I do have reservations about the salon. They are not kidding when they mean no walk ins. Everything has to be scheduled, down to the last little piece of glitter on your gel nails. I'm kidding, but it is somewhat of a hassle to be scheduling and not be able to decide spur of the moment that you want something else in addition to what you're already getting. \n\nI have definitely had better pedicures-- I am in love with my regular nail place's pedicurist. The polish is great, but I didn't really get the attention my feet deserved with the massage and the whole bit. \n\nLastly, I'm confused on how they do the pricing. It would be helpful to know what exactly I'm paying for, since the prices don't seem to match up. I'm quite happy with the gel manicure, but I'm just unsure about a lot of other aspects of the place. \n\nI'm going to give them another try in a couple weeks for their 3D nails. I am going to see Lady Gaga at MGM and what would she think if I just had boring nails? I think Polished is the place to get nails done that will impress her."
0,"Came here for my wife's birthday and had the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant in my lifetime. No exaggeration. We go out to eat all the time and I spent many years waiting tables, so I'd thought I'd seen it all, but this experience takes the cake.\n\nMany details follow, but the worst moment came when after a comedy of errors, we complained to our server and she explained that it was our fault. She specifically explained that she *warned* us that the restaurant was poorly run and then walked away. \n\nSpecifics:\n- Barely saw our server, couldn't get drinks or plates cleared.\n- Had a reservation confirmed for a week, but they couldn't seated us for 45 minutes.\n- Friend ordered the ribs as an appetizer and was served a plate of bones and fat. (This did get corrected and a plate of decent ribs was later presented.)\n- Friend ordered a draft beer that was \""undrinkable\"". After sending it back, was presented with a bottle. When he asked if he could have a glass, our server said \""No. That was the problem the first time. Something is the matter with all of our glasses.\""\n- After ordering, no food 45 minutes later. Server came around to say \""there is a big problem with the sushi. I yelled at them, but they're not moving very fast.\"" All food except for sushi was presented, and literally 45 minutes after everyone had finished eating, we still had no food at all. (See previous about being warned.)\n- When the meal was over, we asked to speak to a manager. We were told by our server she was a manager. When we asked to speak to an owner, our server explained that all the owners \""had left\"". She literally left us with the impression that we had no recourse.\n\nWe were so incensed at the end of the meal, that one of our party went over to the Living Room (which we love and attend frequently) and asked for someone there (they're owned by the same people). At that point we actually got an owner that was really cool. He apologized profusely. He said that our experience was \""unacceptable\"". He took our phone numbers and promised to invite us back to correct the problems. I hope he actually does this. The fact that it took over three hours for someone to apologize was unbelievable.\n\nI would highly recommend you stay away from this place. That the restaurant is running poorly is bad, that they look at you dismissively and tell you that they warned you they don't know what they're doing is unacceptable."
4,"I was really impressed with the place in all aspects: lighting, decor, ambiance, entertainment, service but most of all the food...I mean really like the 'steak frites' were AMAZING! We got top notch service from William  and he wasn't bad lookin' if you know what I mean (wink wink). The entertainment was live and upbeat...I mean really who knew they had singers and a live band every night, might I add. I had an unforgettable dining experience and will be back soon!"
1,"Nice atmosphere, good service, mediocre food at best. My advice save your money."
3,"Yet another business dinner and yet another night of eating WAY too much food!  It's a rough life, I know.  Pity me...\n\nOne of THE most spectacular views of the city, bar none.  Most of the dining room has great/good views through the enormous windows, but I would even recommend the little bar downstairs for a drink and some great views.  Seemed to be not so well known, and a cheaper night than spending on the whole meal.\n\nWhat can I say, the food was fantastic.  The Seared Ahi tuna was delicious with just the right amount of wasabi flavoring.  I ordered the salmon special on a cedar plank that was cooked and flavored absolutely right.  Even the steak was delicious according to some of my table-mates.\n\nWine list was generous (a bit pricey) but well complimenting the meals.  The serving staff was a touch slow, but it was nice not to feel rushed.\n\nTIP:  Try their pretzel bread rolls.  They're delicious!\n\nBIGGER TIP:  Not really sure about parking here, (I think there was valet service) but if you take a taxi there like we did, be prepared.  On a cold, snowy night we were waiting a good 45 minutes for a return taxi to the city.  Make sure to get your cab driver's number on the way over.  Give him an estimated time that you'll be done, and call him before dessert.  You'll save yourself a load of trouble. \n\nAbsolutely a place to take clients/business dinners.  A little pricey, but the food and atmosphere will definitely impress.  It's a little out of the way, but still only a 10 minute cab ride from the Convention Center"
0,"The House of Tricks is aptly named. They have a box full of \""tricks\"" to get you in the door along with many to make sure that you don't return. \n\nDon't be fooled! This clever house of tricks keeps their way over priced, mediocre food and horrible service well hidden until you, and your wallet, have already be taken. Quite the slight of hand!!\n\nI made the mistake of taking my family there for my wife's birthday (6 of us altogether). After sitting for 15 minutes we were greeted by Ben who immediately let us know through his inaction and disinterest that this was going to be a long night of \""no service\"". Ben didn't need to be concerned, though-he was getting his tip no matter what he did, or didn't do for this table. Our choice should have been Burger King for the service, if nothing else. Sorry, no disrespect to those who wear the crown ;-). The bottom line-the House of Tricks has THE WORST SERVICE in Arizona!!! \n\nTheir overpriced food features barely palatable dishes and the portions are small. If you eat there don't expect any \""wow\"" from the food. The only \""wow\"" you will get is when you see the bill!!\n\nIn this economy Arizona has seen the doors of many restaurants shut. We don't need a magic door at the House of Tricks, but we do need it to close!!!"

0,"My husband and I were in Vegas just last week, April 16-20, and we stayed at the Orleans, which is where this particular Friday's is located.  If I could, I would give a \""0\"" star rating.  It will be a very long time, if ever, before we return.  \n\nWe decided to eat at Friday's on Friday evening, April 19, which was our last day in Vegas. After having a drink or two at the Alligator Bar, we decided we wanted something to eat.  We walked over to Friday's and it was only about 11:45 p.m.  We were the only 2 people waiting in line and the hostess was nowhere in sight.  We saw people cleaning up tables and mopping the floors, and finally a gal looked over and asked us if we'd like to be seated.  That should have been my first indication that the dining experience was only going to go down from there.  \n\nWe were seated, and Sara, a server, came over to take our drink order.  After a few minutes, she came back to take our dinner order.  My husband ordered a chicken dish and also a Caesar's salad.  Sara placed our food order and that was  about the last time she paid attention to us.  She totally forgot about my husband's Caesar's salad.  Evidently she felt it was more important to stand in the hallway and take pictures of some balloons that were up front.  Besides Sara, there were 4-5 other Friday's employees doing the same thing.  It was more important that they look at the pictures on their cell phones instead of paying attention to their customers!  \n\nConsidering the restaurant was hardly busy, we waited about 30 minutes before our food came out.  When it did, it was just absolutely horrible.  My husband's chicken dish was so salty he could barely eat it; and the cheese that covered the chicken was totally burnt in many places.  I ordered Korean tacos (I think that's what they were called) and I was not impressed at all.  Very little meat; too many greens carelessly tossed inside the corn tortillas; and it didn't look or taste anything like the way it was described in the menu. Right before our food came out, Sara came over to our table to tell my husband that she \""just realized\"" she forgot his salad!  Of course she did, because the cell phone was far more important to her!  Thankfully, we were not charged for the salad.  \n\nIn the meantime, two more diners came into the restaurant.  They, too, were totally ignored by the employees.  Finally, the gentleman had to literally chase down a server and asked them if Friday's was still open!  Finally, after about 5-7 minutes, this couple was seated.  \n\nBy this time, my husband and I were so upset we decided that we needed to speak to a manager.  Sara came over to ask how our food was, my husband said it wasn't a good experience and he wanted to talk to a manger.  Sara did get the manager and we expressed our displeasure.  The manager was nice enough to not charge my husband for his dinner and she did give us some gift certificates for complimentary appetizers and desserts.  However, the entire experience left me with very negative feelings about Friday's.  \n\nI don't know who does the training at this particular Friday's, but something is sorely missing.  Since when does a hostess station remain empty on a Friday night?  Customers should NOT have to chase down employees in order to get seated.  And the servers should not be standing in the hallway looking at pictures on their cell phones!  This is not \""service\"".  After we complained to the manager, all of a sudden, the servers were doing their jobs.  It shouldn't have had to come to that!  Sara was one of the worst servers I've ever had.  If she's that poor of a server on a relatively slow night, I cringe to think how she is when it's busy!  Needless to say, Sara was not given a tip.  We do not tip for poor service and forgetfulness.  \n\nWe've eaten at this Friday's in the past and we always had good food and service.  What happened on the Friday night we were there was just inexcusable.  If Sara and company don't want to work on a Friday night, they picked the wrong industry.  I do not recommend this Friday's at all, unless you enjoy being ignored, forgotten and served sub-par food.  I don't, and that's why I won't be returning to Friday's when I stay at the Orleans in the future.  I'd rather get a bag of junk food from the Orleans' gift shop before I go back to Friday's!"
3,"Went with a group of friends, the beer selection was very good, the appetizers were also good.\nWe went in at happy hour, $3 off all beers.\nWe could easily view multiple games at the same time and being able to go out on the deck with the view of the Monte Carlo pool.\nOur server, Jose, was great, funny with a great sense of humour  and quick wit, and very well  versed on the menu, especially the beer. \nWe will definitely return on our next Vegas trip, and hopefully take in the much celebrated duelling pianos."
4,This office is not conveniently located to my work or home. The other office where Dr. Carpenter works does not accept our vision insurance. In spite of these challenges I will continue to take my family to see Dr. Carpenter. the office staff is friendly and helpful. The facility is very nice and always clean. Dr. Carpenter has a kind demeanor and is unfailingly patient. If quality of care is your top priority this is the doctor for you.
2,"The bagels are awesome. Super chewy(in a good way) and many varieties to choose from. My favorite is the Rosemary Olive Oil. AMAZING. The breakfast sammy with turkey sausage is a great, filling, easy start to the day. The best part of this sandwich is the magical way it always stays together. There's no AWOL egg sliding down, or mysterious juices ruining my shirt. So if you're in a rush and have to nosh in your car--go for it. \n\nThe not so awesome? The service. it's not bad. it's just not...good. I always feel like the employees are like \""Okay. You're here. I'm here. Let's get this done.\"""
2,"Came here on a Tuesday night with a party of 6. We were warned that Tuesday was their busiest night but we didn't expect to wait for a table for over an hour. However, that gave us time to check out the butcher case and speak with one of the butchers, Kilan. He offered us a bite of some beef jerky they made the previous night, which was delicious. Also, the butcher working the cold meats section near the stairs took pity on us and offered a little appetizer which was also good.\n\nWe finally got seated at our table. Unfortunately, it was right next to the kitchen and in a draft zone. Whenever someone opened the door to the patio, the cold air swept in. Again, manage my took pity on us and tried to warn their servers to close the door behind them. Sometimes they forgot so we had to get up ourselves to shut the door. \n\nWe ordered the calamari and crab cakes for appetizers and they were both delicious. The aoli for the calamari was perfect. I had a couple of bites of my friend's over-the-rainbow salad and I wanted to order one for myself since it was so good. I ordered the skirt steak with a chimichurri sauce for my main course. My steak was cooked perfectly but was a bit on the salty side. I also ordered a side of roasted cauliflower which was fantastic. On the other hand, my boyfriend ordered the jumping beef which was apparently filet mignon with peppers and onions and a kind of light gravy. It came a little too well done when he had asked for it to be medium rare so he only ate a few bites. The coffee dessert was a nice ending to my meal and everyone else enjoyed their desserts. \n\nService was great, everyone was exceptionally friendly. Food was ok/good with the exception of the well done beef, which was comped along with a few of the desserts. I would come back and give this place another try."
0,"So frustrated, I always said I would own a mini forever. After today, I don't know if I can say the same statement. Desert Mini of Las Vegas blew up my engine during a routine maintenance appointment over  5 weeks ago. I went to pick up my car today, (after I was assured it was in good condition) I didn't get 5 minutes down the road before the check engine light came on, oh and the air conditioning didn't work.  They were so quick to tell me they have been test driving it for the past 4 days to make sure it was running properly...we live in Vegas, how do you not notice the air conditioning isn't working after test driving it for 4 days?!?! \n I've never been so mad at a company's customer service. Extremely disappointed, Mini if you don't fix this, you loose a loyal customer.\n\nBefore you decide to purchase from desert mini....check out the ratings.....it's a simple observation. 5 stars= new mini owners 1 star=loyal mini owners getting screwed over by routine maintenance.  Do the math."
3,"This shop has almost all art supplies you may need. They also have a student discount which is a pro. All the stock is very good quality and hence comes with a slightly higher price than you may find say in a supermarket. Keep your eyes peeled for notices for various art classes and art exhibitions. \n\nThey have a very big selection of these amazing Japanese marker pens, which I can never get enough. The shopkeeper is lovely and chatty, and if you can't find anything, it's best to ask, because the shops small size makes it quite crammed with stuff.\n\n All in all, a great place to quench your artistic thirst for equipment, and with the student discount it makes it a bit more affordable."
0,"\""Hipster,Trendy\"" ????-I think NOT !!!! Very disappointing......weird crowd ( older men on the prowl? ) , and unfriendly bartenders w/ lots of attitude. I've given this a few tries thinking I just hit it on a bad night , but won't be going back. So many other great places in Scottsdale to visit !"
3,"Things it seems we can all agree on: the service is a little slow. Maybe leaning towards a lot slow. And probably verging on unfriendly (unless you're Friends of Friends. Yay for F-of-F!)\n\nThings I like that we apparently may disagree on: place is non-smoking! Awesome not smelling like cigarettes.\n\nNow, I saw a complaint about this, but I really prefer my fish in fish tacos battered and deep fried. Which is exactly how Cantina prepared theirs. Maybe this is more a Baja-style fish taco, but whatever. It's also more a Jess-style fish taco. Not only is there a fried fish-delish, the taco portion is huge. It's hard to hold everything together. In fact, that would be my one quibble: there's too much food in the taco. But they are also Mexico City type tacos (Mexico City the city), so they won't generally have a tortilla larger than about 4 inches diameter. There's a lot crammed into those inches though.\n\nThe guacamole was right on. The salsa had a hint of a flavor that I don't love, and I would rather have the chunkier salsa cruda, but it's still good.\n\nI also thought it was very reasonably priced, but my beliefs may have become skewed by Boston. Luckily, I can get re-aligned over the coming months! Pittsburgh pricing is rad. This place is rad. No smoking is rad. And the low-key winter is rad when compared to how much of a crush eating here can be in nice weather."
1,"The thing that attracted me to Whiskey Dick's was their advertisement for $4.95 lunch specials.   It consists of regular sandwiches, chicken sandwiches, burgers and I think pizza.  It's bar food, but not the best bar food I've had.  Sandwiches come with pretty good fries (think Five Guys), but the sandwiches themselves aren't at the same level as the fries.  It would be like having a giant LED flatscreen TV, and then using a set of $30 department store speakers for a sound system.  While one half of the meal is good, the other half isn't quite up to par.\n\nI will say that this is actually a decent bar to get lunch at in the middle of the work day, as the space is nice and open and won't leave you smelling like smoke.  I did see that they have specials on Tuesday nights from 7:00pm - midnight: $1 tacos, $5 burgers, $2 miller lites."
4,Food and Wine were excellent as always will return again very soon. The veal was fantastic.
4,"This has become one of my favorites.  They're friendly,  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious.  My husband and I have tried a number of their items, but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer, house fried rice, the mushu and lemon chicken.  My husband also loves the house fried rice, the mushu and the orange chicken.  One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is, the food isn't heavy.  The sauces are light and fresh tasting.  Plus, I'm lucky enough to be in their delivery zone.  When I get delivery, the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier.\n\nI have yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered here, and to me, that's a sign of a good restaurant."
1,"I'm not a black angus fan but my girlfriend is so i tag along,\nHere are a few of my observations:\nPro's\nGirls at the front desk were great and efficient\nThe waiter was helpful and courteous\nGood ceasar salad\n\nCons\nPrice...  7.25 for a margarita and 11.00 for a 6 shrimp cocktail ??\nBurger and fries 13.00?\nMy girlfriends filet was small\n\nIn the end...there are better values out there for sure. I dropped 60.00 on dinner and had a burger , fries and water. 13.00\nMy girls dinner was 47.00 !\nJust imagine if i ordered an appetizer and had a drink as well !  80.00 + No thanks!"
4,"Every time I visit the city of sin. Amore pizza is a must. Even though they are known for their deep dish pizza, thin crust is the way to go. Their pizza have a super crispy crust. I love their sauce as well. Me and my girlfriend usually get a medium and it gets us both full. the deep dish is good as well but it's just too thick. One slice will get you full. \n\nThe spaghetti with meatballs is in my no fly zone. Do not get it. It tasted like regular spaghetti noodles with a can of hunts spaghetti sauce thrown on top. Even though I think their spaghetti is the worse, this place still gets a 5 star from me"
1,To be honest I'm sad I didn't love this place. I love tapas bars. This place was just ok at best. Walked in and was sat upstairs. The place didn't have many people in it yet they place everyone on top of each basically. You can't even relax because you are so close to the next people. I couldn't even move. It also took a very long for our server to greet us. \n\nWe ordered grilled cheese... They were ok. Nothing special. We ordered the crispy lamb with onion pur\u00e9e. I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. It almost tasted wrong if that makes sense. We also got the cheese plate. I thought that was good.\n\nWine list was also good. Nice Pinot from France.\n\nIt was a little over priced for what you got. I wouldn't recommend.
0,"My boyfriend, his 13 year old brother & I were in Arizona for a baseball tournament. When we first arrived to the Sheraton we thought that it seemed to be a nice hotel. We were booked to stay here one night. After we checked in we went straight to the water-slide & hung out for a bit. When we were finally ready to go back up to the room we showered & got ready for bed. When my boyfriend and I lifted up the blankets to get tucked in, I jumped so far off the bed & he immediately wanted to know what was wrong... THERE WAS BLOOD that was obviously not ours on the white comforter. We called the front desk right away & my boyfriend spoke to a woman about the incident and she said they would send up housekeeping to change the sheets. My boyfriend then asked what else they could do for us because this is unacceptable. She told him that she would see what they could do and she'd call back in a few minutes. About 10 minutes later housekeeping knocked on the door and changed the sheets (she was just as horrified as we were) and then offered us some clean towels. So we didn't hesitate and took the clean towels. The next morning we woke up to shower and get ready for check out. When I got out of the shower I was going to use my towel from the night before until I remembered the housekeeper had brought us clean ones. So I grabbed a clean towel and unraveled it to dry off only to find... MORE DRIED BLOOD! I was furious. When we checked out I mentioned something to the gentleman at the front desk about the incident the night before (since they said they'd call back and never did) and his reaction was that he was already aware of everything. So then I mentioned what had happened with the \""clean towel\"" also & his response was \""That is definitely not one of our standards.\"" I have stayed at plenty of hotels throughout my life & I have never once experienced something so vile and received such poor customer service. Nothing was done to compensate us for the incidents."
3,"Bisher nur ein Beitrag, und der ist nicht so wirklich positiv...\n\n\n Also: ich fands gut. \nAmbiente und Service fand ich eher mittelm\u00e4\u00dfig - aber typisch f\u00fcr ein Indisches Restaurant in Deutschland. \nSehr lange warten mussten wir aber nicht, nur 'etwas lange'.\n\n\n Aber ich fand das Essen sehr sehr schmackhaft. \nSehr w\u00fcrzig, angenehm scharf.\n\n\n Ich werde da auf jeden Fall noch ein zweites Mal hingehen und dann wieder berichten."
0,"Service is horrendous.  Avoid at all costs!  We ordered two appetizers and four entrees.  One entree came first, then one appetizer.  When we complained to the waiter, he just said sorry.  When we complained to the food server, he said this is a fast restaurant, and that's that.  We asked for a manager, and were told he was not available.  The last appetizer came after we had finished most of the entrees.  Tourist trap, lousy service, and average food."
2,"I am not sure most of reviewers are having same as my expericence in WAITING, not for seating but for serving.\n\nOrdered 6 dishes....\nGot 1st dish about 15 minutes later.....\nTook 1 minute to finish....\nAnd this was repeated 6 times....\n(Sorry for my sweetheart as I did not check yelp pictures of food carefully....)\n\nAmong orders, duck and lamb chop were really tender and juicy, but...duck was only 3 of really small pieces, and lamb chop also could be done less than 1 minute.\n\nSo if you are not quantity sensitive and have plenty of time for meal, this place would be ok."
3,"Ragstock is one of those stores you could spend hours in just looking around. It has a cool vibe, and they carry a huge variety of new, vintage, and thrifty clothing and accessories. \nAlthough not everything is of a high quality, it is very affordable. Especially on the sale racks, you can always find something for a steal. \nI've shopped at the Madison location many times and am excited to hear one is coming to the Fox River Mall in Appleton."
3,"This place is great. We purchased the smoked prosciutto, hard salami, and peperoni when we stopped in. The counter staff was very friendly, despite being VERY busy, and made some excellent recommendations. \n\nNext time I'm going to add a selection of cheeses to my purchase of cured meat."
1,"I used to have lunch here all the time, the food for lunch is Ok! It has a huge buffet with a wide variety of Chinese and Japanese food. The sushi is good, the hibachi chicken is decent and the Chinese food is generic. For 10.95$ the variety is good for lunch however I would not recommend this place for dinner. It is very expensive and it has too much going on."
1,"My friends and I went came here during opening weekend (4/28, Laidback Luke).  I'll give credit where credit is due - the light show/lasers in the main room are production heavy and give Hakkasan some credibility.   Also, the DJ in the hip hop room was on point last night, throwing down hit after hit!  You could tell the crowd was really into it (and even some of the bouncers couldn't stop dancing).  \n\nCons:\n- Ladies, the elevators are reserved for bottle service patrons only.  This means you'll have to walk up four flights of stairs to get to the main level, and walk back down four flights of stairs to exit.  \n***TAKE NOTE:  I made a comment to the bouncer at the elevator that making girls in 5 inch heels walk so many stairs to get out is not the business, and, I kid you not, he told me \""WEAR FLATS NEXT TIME\"".  Are you for real??   I've told this story at least 10x in the past 12 hours and you can bet I'll keep telling it until your employees learn to show some class.\n- I didn't buy any drinks last night but my guy friends did.  Expect to pay $18.50 for a Redbull Vodka.\n- This club is probably 20% walk way/dance foor, 30% stairs, and 50% tables.  Everywhere you look, there are tables upon tables.  I get this is the kind of clientele you're trying to attract, but frankly I found it to be total overkill, especially since so many of the tables went empty.\n\nI had an 8am flight to catch this morning and initially, I was bummed I'd have to leave early to catch some sleep.  Then I actually experienced the club first-hand and was quite grateful to have an excuse to leave well before Laidback Luke even got on.  My friends didn't have the same early-flight excuse but left shortly after I did.\n\nHakkasan definitely has some big issues to work out.  Until then, I'll stick to XS and Marquee!"
1,"Excessive Make Up Hostess was really rude, a robot would show more genuine courtesy. The music was great. The atmosphere felt like a child's park due to shouting kids, running around the restaurant. The decor felt like outdoor seating and the writing all around walls made the place feel like a high school chemistry desk because of all the writing. We arrived a few minutes before another table but was waited on after that table.  The worst aspect of the restaurant, the CHARGE for TAP WATER! The waitress was nice. Would I eat here again? Only if this was the last place for seafood. Would make a decent place for beer pong competitions."
0,"Why would you ever stay here? \n\n1. The theme is ridiculously cheesy.\n\n2. All the casino patrons are really angry old Filipina grandmas (no hate, I love the Filipinos, but man y'all get mean after age 50 or so).\n\n3. When you enter the room towers, you literally feel like you've been transported to a prison camp in the jungles of 'Nam in '68.\n\nAs a young lass, I once tried to meet a group of female friends-of-friends at the IP to keep the party going after hours, only to find that they were all Vietnamese and looking...rough. Given point 3, you can understand why I ran away as fast as I could and haven't been back since."
1,"Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse."
4,"I haven't been to a better buffet in vegas, than this one! \n\nFood: they have just about EVERYTHING you could think of.  Full salad bar (even with multiple types of lettuce).  Soups, breads, all different kinds of meats, seafood (crab, shrimp, sushi, sashimi), pastas, omelets, and much much more.  there is a huge selection of desserts, and they even have ice cream/gelato that they scoop for you on the spot, and put on toppings. yum!  Ive been here a couple times, and the food is always fresh. \n\nService: even though the line is rather long, the wait time isnt actually that bad. The wait is well worth it though.  The staff is nice, the cooks/chefs behind the counters are friendly, and the waiters that occasionally come around are efficient. \n\nAmbiance: the decorations are so extravagant and pretty! they always have fresh flowers.  there is a TON of natural daylight, so the space always feels fresh.  it almost feels like you are outdoors.  very pleasant place to have lunch/dinner. \n\nPrice: rather expensive, but for what you get.. well worth it! \n\nIf you go here, be sure not to fill up on bread and pasta.  go for the seafood! yum! \n\nI would definitely eat here again when i'm in vegas!"
1,We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back.
0,"Ughhh. I gave alchemy a second.. third.. Chance.  They finally had enough sense to drop their absurd prices ($15 for a pretty average burger? Come on...) so I thought they were worthy of another shot.  Welp, they replaced their absurd prices with absurd service and a lack of pretty much every item on the menu.  I mean, at 10 PM on a Friday night, how can you possibly be out of almost all of your draft beers, Captain Morgan, and half of your appetizers, INCLUDING the one that the waiter recommended?   Maybe you should make sure you actually have something before recommending that your customers order it?  And OH WAIT... they didn't ACTUALLY drop the prices.. they just stopped included fries with your meal and charge 4 freaking dollars to add them on.  So let's do the math... 5 lbs of potatoes costs about $3 - you get about 4 oz. of fries -  so the true cost is somewhere around 15 cents?  Sounds like a rip-off to me.   \n\nSad.. this place could be cool.  But alas, it sucks.  Spend your money elsewhere.  And hope that the schmuck running this place takes a look at some of these reviews and gets a clue."
2,I think this was my third time here last time was more enjoyable and the fee to get in was much less. \nThis time a 50 dollar fee to get in during the holiday they say. and the food was just not as good. Not to say the food was not good. It was! it just was not as good as before. \n\nAlso the service was much slower and our overall experience was not as good a previous times \nThe fish and meat was more dry this time not as juicy as last time. \n\nPerhaps next time i will try the Wynn buffet if my parents takes us there.
1,It's not as good as you hope. It's not a real pub. And the food is less than mediocre. I guess the real reason to stop in is for the beer. The place does look inviting but there is no table service and all the food is prepackaged. The sandwiches were mostly stale bread with very little fixings on them. We would have been better off trying a fast food spot
4,Love Honeybaked Hams... and their Turkey is excellent too!  \nYou can even get sides for a complete and delicious meal!\nOR... you can go for lunch and order a tasty sandwich and side.\n\nSuggestion... call ahead and order the size ham you want.... especially if you are ordering during holiday times.
1,"OK, so perhaps my overall Wynn experience led to me giving Okada 2 stars instead of 3....but it really deserves NO MORE.\nThe posse and I made reservations 2 weeks i advance, (mostly because I'm a spaz planner like that), and upon arrival, the hostess tells us there will be a twenty minute wait....OK\nFinally we are seated, order our sake, appetizers, and then our waiter leaves...I guess he didn't want to take our dinner orders? OK, slow food dining experience...our sake comes, service is extremely attentive, constantly filling our sake cups, pouring water, etc...our appetizers come, and everyone VANISHES! No joke, we waited after our appetizer plates were clearly licked clean for a busser, a server,ANYONE to come back and take our entree orders. One of our party ends up getting up, and physically grabbing a buss boy, asked him to send over our waiter....another 20 min go by...FINALLY, he appears. No apology, takes our entree orders, and vanishes...no, \""would you like another bottle of sake,\"" NOTHING. Being rather annoyed at this point, and our whole table talking about the bad service, our entrees come, still no refill on the sake....we ask for our server, he NEVER comes back to our table. We finish our entrees, decide dessert at this place is not worth another hour wait, and flag down another busser, CHECK PLEASE!. We wait, and wait and wait....no check. WE decide this is too comical a situation to be pissed, so we get up, all eight of us, leave our table and walk directly to the hostess, demand to see a manager. Manager comes after another 15min wait, we explain the situation, he chastises us for \""walking out on the bill,\"" we hand him a pile of cash and swear never to return. \nI'd like to clarify, we didn't try and walk out on the bill, we would have just walked straight out the front door had that been the case. We were trying to pay for our meal so we could go downstairs and enjoy our table a Tryst. Not only did the manager not apologize for our terrible service, he didn't offer to comp anything, and had a nasty attitude the whole time. \nI will never go back to Okada, the food was decent, but when there are places like Social House, why would I endure bad service when I'm paying top dollar?"
2,"I didn't even know this place was here, wife had to tell me about it. Had to ship out a pre-labeled package. When I walked in, there were about three people in front of me. Within 5 minutes there were four people in back of me. I could tell the lady working there was getting frustrated. She was the only one there? Everyone was patient and knew she was under pressure. But management really needs to add more workers. She really did her best,\nMy experience wasn't that bad, and would use again."
3,"One of the best reasons I'm happy to be alive is STEAK.  Life would be oh so boring without it.  For date night, we couldn't figure out where we wanted to eat at since we weren't too hungry and it was already 9:30pm...most places were closing at 10pm but thankfully, Gordon Ramsay keeps his doors open until 10:30pm.\n\nThe restaurant, especially the entrance, reminds me of a club...a well-lit club.  We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar area and didn't have to wait to get a table.  We were given an amazing plate of different kinds of bread. 2 were aged parmesan, 1 bacon, 1 mushroom and 2 lemony breads. In a world full of free sourdough bread, complimentary bread got exciting again. We got the medium rare 24oz dry-aged bone-in rib eye, fingerling potatoes and mac n cheese.\n\nDRY-AGED BONE-IN RIBEYE: their medium rare is bloodier than usual but I'd rather eat a bloody steak than a hockey puck.  It was tender and no sauce was needed. Just pure meaty perfection. 5/5\n\nFINGERLING POTATOES: with parmesan and truffle...they were flavorful. The perfect side for a awesome piece of meat 5/5\n\nMAC N CHEESE: with peas, truffle and 3 different cheeses - blue, cheddar and parmesan.  It was tasty, rich and quite heavy. 4/5\n\nFor personal reasons, we skipped dessert. The service was alright. For the price and quality of meat we got, I may have found a new favorite steak place in Vegas.  But no, I still love Mario Batali."
3,"Its very fresh, and its some tasty business. They focus on what they know, tacos, burritos, and quesadillas, no more, no less. No 200 items to choose from. Its a little tiny thing in a strip mall so dont expect stellar service. Focus on the flavor of the food and be done with it. Easy in, and easy out.\n\nI ordered two items, the carne asada burrito and a carne asada taco. I definately think the carne asada is better than La Condesa I had a few weeks ago. I think the guacamole I got along with the burrito is good. But is it worth an extra $1? I dont think so..."
4,"High- end skincare & cosmetics lines, looking for something in skincare /make-up, perfumes not easy to find.. Penhaligon, Tocca, Dermalogica, Skinceuticals? Here is the place! Personalised service, make-up, skincare consultations, advice, there is an esthetic salon upstairs for treatments should you feel like it.  Looking for something different or something you've been searching high and low for,  try this place ."
4,"Ok I've been eating Italian, real Italian, all my life with my friends and family through New York and New England and even in Italy and I am blown away by the authenticity and quality of the food at Mama Ricotta's - I've lived in Charlotte for about 2 years now and have missed this place until today, New Years Eve 2014. It's not really in my hood but decided I wanted some Rigatoni, Yelp'd it, and these guys came up. I've driven by it dozens of times and to be honest, thought it may be a sandwich/sub shop or some other take out type strip mall joint. DON\""T BE FOOLED by the unassuming street front. Go inside and check it out!! I literally stopped at the reception (yes, I was greeted and welcomed) and had to smile. While taking in the inviting, Italian Chalet ambience that looks like it should be situated on some Mediterranean bluff, I was directed over to the bar to pick up my take away order. The kind gent behind the bar, who was on the horn taking other orders, glanced over with a quick smile to let me know he knew I was there. This is something I always notice in a restaurant or anywhere customer service is important - does that staff look past you or do they make an effort for eye contact? Based on the time frame from order to when I actually arrived (10 min) he was able to guess who I was and promptly went to packaging my order. Needless to say I was already excited - it smelled like my Auntie Rita's (not really my aunt) kitchen on Sunday afternoon. An oversized handled bag (re-usable) was filled with what appeared to be my order plus maybe another 2 patrons orders. Everything was kept in a warmer cabinet (not under a heat lamp) until I arrived which was also housing baking sheets full of tear apart rolls...they'll change your life, for sure. I had a moment to look around their bar/lounge area which I will certainly be back to. I didn't see the wine list but it appears you'll most definitely be able to find something you like - I saw lots of good opened bottles meaning you can get it by the glass. There is a wood fired pizza oven as soon as you walk in and I saw a few being carried out by the staff that looked really nice. The bar keep thanked me, wished me Happy New Year and off I went.\nI ordered the Rigatoni with Meat Sauce and the Chopped Salad. Absolutely amazing!\nThe pasta was cooked perfectly - great texture and flavor. The gravy was bright red and full of fresh tomato flavor. The meat was tender and possibly rough chopped meatballs. The wife thought there should be more gravy but I thought it was just perfect. The salad was certainly a masterpiece. Chopped is certainly the right name for this salad. Everything in it was chopped so that it blended all of the flavors of the salad in every bight.  Olives, Pepperoncini, Tomatoes, Blue Cheese, Nuts (Walnuts??), Lettuce, Kale, Carrot, Onion, Chick Pea.....all I can say is, Damn!\nNeedless to say, I'll be back, lots - Can't wait to work my way through their menu. \nThanks, Mama!"
2,"You cannot visit Montreal/Quebec without trying some poutine but I really wanted a burger so my boyfriend ordered the poutine so I could taste it.  I had the Le B\u00ea\u00ea\u00earger which is a beef burger with goat cheese and bacon and I had the frites as my side and the American sauce.  My burger was cooked to perfection and the goat cheese and bacon just absolutely made the burger delicious.  The La Vladimir (classic) poutine was just okay.  I ended up having a way better poutine at an Italian restaurant later in my trip.  The place was packed with young college students which didn't really bother me much.  All-in-all, it was a satisfying experience."
4,"Another one of Emeril's top notch restaurants, this one being a steak connoisseur's paradise.  We booked the night before and got in before the traditional 7-7:30 dinner rush.  Service- top notch.  Mind you, everything is a la carte.I cant help but feel underdressed even though we were dressed well for the venue.  They have an insane wine list that goes on and on.  I had the bone-in ribeye which was done to perfection - medium rare.  We also had the creamed spinach and wild mushrooms.  So good we finished everything leaving little to no room for dessert.  Definitely should try the dessert since they all looked exceptional, especially Emeril's claim to fame Banana Cream Pie!"
1,"Meh, nice patio but lackluster service if it's busy. I don't think we're cool enough to hang here, at least that's how they made us feel, and no one should feel that way as a paying customer. Not worth a return trip."
4,"We were visiting Phoenix and were in search of good sushi.\nWe were so happy to find this place . It's one of the best Japanese food I've had .\nFirst off the black rice was a unique concept and they had it on tv to explain the Benefits of black rice . \nWe ordered a chirashi bowl and loved the presentation .\nThe best part was that it had real wasabi .Ive actually never had real wasabi before.\nChirashi was so good we ordered 2.\nWe ordered Gyoza. The dipping sauce was very tasty and the outer skin on the Gyoza was tender and delicious .\nWe also ordered two rolls , shrimp tempura roll \nThe ambience was nice and we were lucky to come right when it opened at 5 because as we ate it became busy fast .the waitress's was also super nice and helpful.\nI highly recommend this place!"
1,"We went on Friday night to Don and Charlie's with some friends.  We didn't have a reservation so the wait was quite long, which really wasen't a big deal because I knew the wait would be long.\n\nThe owner saw that we we had been waiting so he found a table for us.\nThe problem was the waitress was quite busy and when we ordered our food she assumed that we would be sharing so she had everything split.  We asked numerous times for ketchup and she kept forgetting.  \nThe biggest problem I had was that I ordered ribs.  They were so dry that I had to pour lots of sauce over them.  Earlier that night the ASU football team was there, I think they cooked a ton of ribs and had extras that they didn't use, so then they served those to us.  They were the worst ribs I have ever had!\n\nI do love the decor and maybe the food would be better at another time."
0,"The absolute worst customer service.  I spent $156 in RC parts to include a set of TRAXXAS JATO Front and Rear Wheel sets as a Christmas present to a family member.  As it turns out, the wheel set was purchased in error and asked for a refund ($33/set).  Upon calling the day after Christmas to see if the store was open, I was surprised at the lack of customer service and overall rudeness of the store manager (for which his father is the owner).  He said, \""don't you read the reciept...no exchanges for store credit only\"". I said that how would I know that if the reciept is handed to me after the purchase...not before.  He then said, \""It's a store policy not to provide refunds... it's written on the back of our register\"".  Again, I don't normally read everything posted in a store.  Why didn't they inform me verbally of this policy before purchasing the items?  The overall demeanor of this guy was absolutely unacceptable and I will NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM THIS STORE AGAIN!  I would NEVER recommend anyone to go there.  You'll find prices and service much cheaper online.  Read these reviews and you'll see that Hobby Town USA in Gilbert Arizona don't deserve OUR business.  I ususally don't bother with reviews, but these people pushed me over the line....I will do my best to place my honest review in every site available to expose the truth about this business.  Next call will be to the Hobby Town corporate office...they need to know that their name is being trashed in AZ."
0,"The food was great, the customer service was horrible! I called in an order and asked for it to be split into three. When I arrived to pay the man at the register basically scolded me telling me he wasn't going to make other people wait in line while he split my order. The person on the phone did not tell me this was a policy. I won't be back. He was rude and it was completely uncalled for. Maybe the person taking phone orders needs some training!"
0,First off we get there right at time it opens we were seated and got our drinks.  We ordered. And waited and waited.  Nothing. And waited.  Nothing.  Finally we flag our waiter down and he's like I'm so sorry ill go check.  As we look around everyone who came in after us already got their food. No worries they will get it.  So we finally get it. It was cold.  Like it was sitting out for over 40 min (our wait time after ordering).  So we tell the waiter he apologizes. They bring it back.   Still cold. We decide we can't eat this and we ask for the check.  The waiter asks us if we are doing good and Howe food was we tell him and he apologizes. The manager comes and apologizes and comps our meal \nIt looked good but too cold to eat. Maybe we give it another chance one day but not right now.
0,"I was excited to try this after hearing the excitement from other people that \""Tommy's is coming to Vegas!!!\"" After a short description that included \""the chili is kind of like Hormel\"", I was in. I've always kind of liked Hormel chili, but I also always thought it to be the lowest possible standard for chili. Tommy's has lowered the bar. \n\nThe chili is a weird sticky/greasy concoction that they dump on everything. It barely tastes like anything... They give samples to everyone before they order, I think because they KNOW it's horrible and most people will hate it. \n\nEven after the bad sample, I got a chili cheeseburger, hoping it would work in its home environment. It didn't."
2,"A clerk once agreed with me that Walmart corporate might have forgotten this store exists.\n\nMaybe it's left over from one of the corporation's many, many re-sizing experiments, as this is sort of a Walmart Junior. There is no sewing section, and the craft section is one half-aisle of \""kids crafts.\"" Every other section also seems smaller than usual. If you're thinking about a fatty, salty snack to ease your shopping experience, get it outside the store, as there's no snack bar.\n\nI'm going as high as three stars because the store is clean and quiet every time I go, and the clerks seem less beaten-down than at larger Walmarts. At 7:30 on a weekday morning, it's a fabulous place to go if your need to meditate in solitude overlaps with your need to buy cat litter or other household basics."
1,Well where can I start. Over the past few years I've occasionally dropped in to eat here in hopes that they would improve. Sometimes the foods great and the service sucks or vice versa. I can never seem to get both at the same time. The past couple of times I've eaten here I've found that the food was bland. The maduros tasted like it was fried earlier that day then microwaved when ordered. The beans were lukewarm along with the dish. It seems like they cooked all the food earlier and reheated it when I ordered it. The Sangria was the only thing that was decent. The service was good AFTER the waitress decided to come to our table to help us which took a while.  The Yuca con Mojo used to be really good here but the other day it was dry and tasteless. The only reason why I keep trying this place out is because there are very few choices in town. Not going anymore after this.
4,"They have finished the renovation of the driving range and it's fantastic! On one side they have the normal hitting stations where you can get balls from a dispenser. On the other side is a double decker range which is all automated. You pay and get a ticket inside, input the number into the computer at your station, and it automatically tees up each ball for you. You can put the ball on the mat if you don't want it teed up and you can also adjust the tee height to match the club you are using. It will bring the next ball at the same height until you change it. The best turf driving range around!! Check it out!"
2,"For what it is, it's great. A gourmet style take out marketing with eat in dining area and bistro. I loved the look and feel of the market. It reminded me of Dean and Deluca in NYC. The one in Soho. I ordered a \""malke your own salad\"" at the salad bar and a sushi roll. I was dying to try their sushi so I ordered both and took some to go. the salad bar was great I ordered tons of veggies, some cheese, a hard boiled egg and a piece of grilled chicken it was $8.  I think a fair price for a huge ass salad. The sushi on the other hand was mediocre. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and well I won't be getting sushi there again. The fish was fresh although the rice was not right. I'd say the sashimi would be a better bet. The did carry my favorite water from tuscany Acqua Panna although it seemed a bit pricing at $1.75 for the 16.9 oz bottle. Either way I recommend checking out dish. I think you'll agree it's a diamond in the rough."
4,"This place is clean, decorated very cute and the ladies are all friendly and super accommodating. I've never had an issue getting in even when it's last minute and the prices are fair. I get gel overlay and they never disappoint."
0,I had a reaction to the Pancar Salatasi; no doubt to the canned or tinned beets. You would think for $6 for 2 bites of beets they could use a fresh one?
0,"I like Italian cuisine. I also like a good date night. This visit was so underwhelming that I will now rate the Olive Garden chain as fine Italian dining at its very, very best. We were here on a early weekday night with a very light crowd. Unfortunately, we did not order pizza. We had the restaurant.com certificate and thought we would try the pasta entrees. My date had shrimp fettuccine alfredo and I ordered a sort of baked ziti with sausage - the sausage was served separately!?! \n\nThe shrimp was in actuality salad shrimp. It looked like noodles with pieces of pink lucky charms in them with a taste of noodles with a nondescript presence of fish. The pasta with sausage tasted like it was just made, thawed out and served by the school cafeteria. It gave me the feeling that someone did scoop out something and plopped it on my plate as a carried the tray to the cashier. I should've had a bowl of tapioca or something on the side! The was one step better in that we were able to eat without someone yelling food fight! \n\nNice small place. You could pass it without seeing it in this area. No big signage. The toilet in the woman's room did not work properly. The restaurant.com certificate was blamed for a miscalculated bill. The pizza may be authentic but certainly not the pastas. My date and I are still together but this would be an ideal place to go if you wanted to break up."
3,"I must be a snob when it comes to bakeries, because I wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be. They had a beautiful selection of cakes, pastries and macaroons but unfortunately not much caught my eye. I did however love the plain and chocolate croissants and my boyfriend loved the two pieces of chocolate cake. I would have loved a bigger selection though. There was almost an entire cold case filled with macaroons, and for someone who doesn't much like them, I wish there had been more pastries and cookies."
1,"I get that this place is a lounge and not a club but that being said, it's a LOT smaller than I expected. For a small lounge, you'd think it'd be packed. No, it was pretty dead when I went and based on everyone else's reviews, it's pretty dead on more than one occasion. \n\nI guess being dead serves us well considering we had a group of 15 with 8 of them being guys. We had no problem getting the guys in but I'm guessing the club figured, better to have guys in the lounge than no people at all. \n\nI guess I was expecting a lot considering it's Vegas and everything is always overdone here. I like the REVOLUTION sign that spells LOVE on the other side but honestly other than that, I don't think I'd come back here again."
1,"Yeah, Alexander is right...they do leave you alone. That's the good part. The bad part comes when you actually want some advice. For the most part they are clueless. What really gets me is how hard they push the extended warranties. I know that it's a big revenue stream for them but it really boarders on criminal how they take advantage of people. Oh well, buyer beware I suppose :-)"
1,"I will not stay here again.  I am an owner in the Diamond Resorts chain and I have never been treated so badly at a Diamond affiliate.  On the good side, the housekeeping staff was terrific.  However, we made a mistake and forgot to put our parking pass on our dashboard one night.  The security guard pasted a sticker on our window that would not come off.  When I complained to management that they could use post it glue and not damage vehicles for a simple mistake, the manager did not care at all.  Yes, we made a mistake.  Does that give them the right to damage our vehicle?"
3,You've gotta try the cotton candy ice with custard. It's simply incredible.
0,"liars, thieves, dont keep their word and are worse in customer service. i will never return again and neither will my friends or family. i love toyota vehicles, but i will have to invest in a honda."
3,my family and I were in Vegas celebrating my daughters 21St birthday.r found this shop by accident we actually were suppose to go too another shop.anyway we were greeted Sooo pleasantly. Everyone is sincerely pleasant.Nina is awesome my legs  were hurting from all the walking and I specifically wanted a massage on my feet and legs after my pedicure.wow after that had another great massage on the hands and arms for my manicure.  my hands were rejuvenated after she did my manicure. I highly recommend this place in fact my daughter and I plan on going there every year on our annual Vegas trip.
4,"Love this place!  It's a definite must every time i'm in vegas!  I always get the whole pie, half white sauce and half red sauce with sausage. Simple but amazing!  \n\nMy tips: Takes about 30 minutes or so for a whole pie, so don't come starving!"
1,"As a San Francisco bay area resident, I thought it would be interesting to try Asian cuisine in Montreal's Chinatown District. Beijing came up as a highly YELP rated place. And, so we gave them a shot. \nTypical, super noisy, large open room, that has too many tables and chairs packed into it. We ordered the Chicken Soo Guy. The server described Soo Guy as a 'special Asian sauce\"" . . .UH, your typical sweet and sour sauce is not what I would call \""special\"". . . sorry, didn't like it one bit. The spicy beef had a bit of flavor, but that was only because we asked for it to come out \""SUPER\"" spicy. . . What's it like in the normal preparation?  All in all, I was not impressed with this place, and would not return."
2,"Solid Banh Mi indeed for $3. But It's hard to rank this in place in the upper echelon of the baguette kingdom simply for the fact that the bread is outsourced. That means when it's re-toasted, the baguette turns very crumbly.  I do like how the restaurant makes your sandwich because the ingredients are top notch. You can't miss when your grilled pork served with regular dishes ends up in your Banh Mi. My gripe is that I feel the grilled meat here leans more towards the Chinese BBQ version vs the Vietnamese version. That means not enough lemongrass and nuoc mam. Notice I didn't comment on the buttery goodness that all Banh Mi should have. \n\nSolid 3 stars for Banh Mi."
1,This review is for the restaurant side of the business. Brought the family here because we had heard good things about the place. When you walk in you're immediately hit with cigarette smoke. It was like standing near a huge ash tray it just was nasty. Because the bar is separated from the restaurant they're are no waitress in the restaurant side. We had to wait more than 5 minutes for someone to show up. We almost left but finally a waitress showed up and  seated us. I ordered the steak dinner and I'll just say I wish I would've ordered something else. The steak tasted like it was cooked on the street out back. Really tough and just tasted rank. I asked for medium and got super well done. My wife ordered the same thing and asked for medium also and hers was more done than mine! I can't comment on the rest of the food because we don't plan on going back. I have heard the bar portion is a lot better but I don't know personally. Just for the smell alone is enough for me not to go back.
1,"I have to come here sometimes to get things they dont have at the fruit and veggie place right beside here (PA) and I'm always so disappointed. I've been frequenting this place since 2010 and I've disliked it ever since. Everything is over priced. You'd have better luck going to a dep and buying groceries there than coming here. Ok, thats a but dramatic but seriously, you're right downtown. People need food and this location barely has anything. The more common fruits and veggies (sometimes they don't even have those). A couple brands of milk, cereal, chicken, cheese and so on.\n\n\nYes, the place is smaller than an average provigo, but come on! we need to eat! Its also mostly student around here as well, get on that! We are tired of just eating your (expensive) ramen!"
3,"Treasure Island wasn't as bad as I expected it to be from all the reviews. \n\nMe and my boyfriend ending up staying here because it was the cheapest hotel for the weekend. We spent about $260 for 3 days and 2 nights, thats including the resort fee. The room and bathrooms were nice and spacious. The beds were super comfy and the pillows felt like clouds. \n\nMy only complaint was that the cleaning person did not come and fix the room. We left early Saturday morning and came back in the afternoon thinking we were gone long enough for our room to be cleaned and it wasn't.\n\nOverall our stay was nice. Check in was fast, but that was probably because we came around 8pm on Friday. Check out was easy, we just did it from our TV in the room and dropped the keys in the drop box by the elevators on the first floor."
0,"Here is my gripe. The food is good. No complaints there. It's the employees. While standing at the register and ordering, there were three girls behind the counter that kept staring at my wife, whispering, and rolling their eyes. They were literally looking her up and down. I had sunglasses on so they could not see that I was watching them, and actually my wife didn't notice it because she was busy ordering for our kids. After we went and sat down, I continued to watch them, and from a distance I not only observed the girls gawking at various femaie customers, but two of the male employees were also gawking at various girls and nudging and elbowing each other and staring. I have noticed this going at a two other restaurants, Rubios just up the street, and Port O Subs at Desert Ridge. And it's not like I'm looking for this, I just have a habit of noticing details in my surroundings. I would like to know if I am the only person in the world that notices things like this, because this behavior seems to be very common and management knows nothing (or does nothing) about it."
3,"I'd never eaten sushi before, and this conveyer belt style was a great way to get introduced. I got to see everything available and ask questions about everything in real time rather than be force to decide from a menu. My more experianced sushi friends raved about it to."
4,"First of all, you can't beat the view from the 64th floor of The Hotel at the Mandalay Bay.  The evening view of the Strip is unparalleled.  Beyond the hip lounge is the restaurant.  From the lounge you walk through a corridor where you have an opportunity to view the open kitchen.  I like watching chefs work and this was a treat.  Then you step into a cream white colored paradise.  Feels like you stepped into a glass of bubble filled champagne.  \n\nWe ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu - go Three Squares!  The grilled foie gras was probably the best that I have ever had and I eat a lot of foie gras.  The foie is so much sweeter when it comes from corn fed ducks as opposed to pellet fed ducks (from Hudson Valley for example).  It shows that the chef knows how to source his ingredients.  \n\nThe rest of the dishes were delicious but I loved the cheesecake dessert.  The sweet fluffy and light mouse cheesecake was paired with a more savory sour cream sorbet which I loved!  The sorbet was such a surprise and delight that I forgot about the cheesecake.  \n\nService was impeccable.  The waiter knew his cuisine.  Overall, a wonderful dining experience."
4,"This is the best fried chicken Ive had. I can't even compare it to KFC, Popeyes, or Brown's.\nThis place is so popular in the Philippines, and are slowly moving East.\nThere's only one location in Las Vegas, but much more in California.\nThey serve Fried Chicken with rice or fries, they have burgers, they have pancit palabok, they have noodle soup, they have bubble shakes, its just pure heaven in the fast food race.\nThey definitely need to move faster East and open locations in Chicago."
4,"I was very pleased at the service and value you receive when boarding your best friend here. \n\nStaff is friendly and helpful.\n\nThe kennels have and indoor/outdoor run which they keep warm on the colder months and cooler on warmer months.\n\n$20 bucks a day to board Fuji at a place that's easy to get to before you hit the strip, I will definitely bring him back here."
0,Restaurant was open but there was no server to be found. So we just walk out and went somewhere else.
4,"Had to take up temporary residence here after a flood disaster at our home. The two bedroom suite with a kitchen was perfect for my husband and I, two young children and Grandma (who was visiting from out of town). The rooms were clean and well kept, and the free breakfast was much better than your average run of the mill cereal bar. The pool and jacuzzi were relaxing and clean, and the lobby staff always greeted us with a bright smile. I would highly recommend this hotel."
2,"If you're looking for a nice clean place to pass out from partying all night then this is the place for you. Not a glitzy hotel, but I personally would rather pay less for a room so I could have more money to do other stuff. The pool was nice and clean..perfect for 100+ degree weather."
2,"Other than the hostess being a total snob upon our arrival, we had a great experience at Cafe Martorano (our server was much friendlier, so that took the bitterness out of the first impression.)\n\nI went with the pre-fixe menu, which was actually a great price by Vegas standards - $45 for three wonderful courses. Started with the caprese salad (really fresh and tasty), then the tagliatelle with cream sauce, chicken and peas (rich and delicious), and ended the meal with a sweet cannoli. \n\nOur waiter was really friendly and helpful with suggestions - everyone agreed the portions were HUGE (too much, really), but the food was delicious. It's a nice place in the Rio and I'd definitely go again."
4,I don't come in often - The bar scene isn't my thing but I can always count on Morgan in the kitchen to cook up some deliciousness.  I haven't been let down by the menu yet!  Thanks!
0,"I have been to this one many different times as it right down the street from my house and it is on the way home from school. I love taco bell; however every time I go to this location it is like there is something major wrong. \nAt first I thought that it was because I went during an off time, I used to work at a Taco Bell in CA and know that food only stays good for so long and during off times you will end up with the end of the containers or you will end up with gross old food.\n\nSo I did not write a review because it was just my timing. I waited and went at a busy high traffic time; and still was not happy with the quality of the food.\n\nEvery time I order the soft taco supreme they are always like wet and stuck to the wrapper, with the meat soaking through the wrapper. Thought at first this was me because it took me a whole 10 mins to get home; so the last time I actually just drove out of the drive-thru and sat in car and looked tacos they were already like that; I order mine special so that they cant use the premade stuff; yes as employees we would pre-make some of the most popular items to make it easy to give out, like the soft tacos; pinto and cheese.  \n\nThe beans on the nachos every time where cold and so gross! I am just wishing that they would pull it together because it is on my way and super convenient when I want something before I hit home."
1,"The staff was really unimpressive.  The food, okay.  Overpriced for what you get.  They are really trying to run an upscale restaurant but they have a  long way to go to achieve this.  Wine list is very limited, the food portions are tiny and the staff is a tad bit stuffy.  You can find far better in Charlotte than what they offer here."
2,"The wait staff was nice, The service was good, The food was as good as it always is at CPK. If you like CPK.. You will like it here"
1,"1.5 stars, rounded up because one star reviews make me so sad.\n\nFoolish me was not paying attention while planning a trip and ended up here with a five hour layover beginning at 9pm.  We were headed home to Hawaii, and thought it would be fine.  Land, grab some food, catch some sleep, hop on the plane, continue our sleep, and be home in time for breakfast with friends.  I did not count on the airport not being ready to help me with my plans.\n\nWhy, oh why, in an airport with flights at all hours of the day and night, would all of the restaurants close at 9pm?  Why would the only things open be the news stand and a pizza hut serving whatever had been under the heat lamp for the past few hours?  \n\nWhy, oh why, would there be no signs telling people how to get from the main terminal to the itty bitty terminal one needs to find to check into Hawaiian Airlines?  And why when you find your way to the itty bitty terminal would there be nothing warning you that you won't get to check in until an hour before your flight, no matter that the pre-security waiting area is nothing more than a line of empty counters and a few scattered seating areas?  No food, hidden restrooms, and no space for the plane-full of people who assembled, waiting for the check-in process to begin.  Most of my layover was spent standing, waiting for someone to fire up the computer.  I've never cursed having checked luggage more than for this flight, not even the time I moved from Germany to Korea with a 6 year old and 9 bags all weighing 70 pounds each.  \n\nBecause the flight was not available for check in ahead of time, I had to stay ahead of the high school group which filled the entire coach section of the plane.  There were a few hundred teenagers, their adult handlers, and a few scattered families and other late night travelers. We were easy to pick out, as we were the only ones not wearing the school colors (maroon and white) and we were the ones battling to be first in line so we could find places to sit once we made it past security.\n\nAt some point during my endless purgatory, a friendly worker asked me if I had enjoyed my time in Vegas.  I explained that  I had been to Vegas before, and enjoyed it very much, but that this was just a layover.  I also told him that this was quite possibly the worst airport experience I'd had in 40 years of air travel, and that if I never returned to Vegas it was simply because I wanted to avoid this airport.\n\nObviously, I have realized that the on-the-spot review might have been a bit harsh, so I've settled on rounding up to two stars instead of down to one. The rounding up has everything to do with the staff, almost all of whom were friendly and as helpful as they could be, considering the constraints of the actual airport."
0,"This dentist is very nice but I do have question some of his suggestions. He wanted to put an enamel backing on my front teeth because he said they were cracked. I think I would have noticed if my front teeth were cracked. My two front teeth have a little ridge in the middle- it has always been there and that is just the shape of my teeth. My dentist says my front teeth are perfect and there is nothing wrong with them. He also wanted do a deep cleaning and I had no idea what that was and he explained what it was and that I had a $200 deductible for that. I told my mom about the deep cleaning and she told me that is for people with gum disease and that I don't need it since my gums and teeth are healthy. I told the dentist that I discussed it with my mom who had previously been a dental hygienist and he said that he would waive my deductible and just not tell the insurance company. I was so stunned I said fine and he took about 5 minutes in my mouth with using this tool to do the deep cleaning. It was a strange experience. I didn't realize until today that his \""deep cleaning\"" wasn't even as thorough as my new dentists regular cleaning. I'm glad I found a new dentist that I trust my pearly whites with."
3,"Always friendly staffs and fast service!  One day, We went there for my sister's birthday. I always get the Shrimps with the *Whole Sha-Bang sauce in medium hot. To me the spiciness is just right, it's not too mild or too hot. Their sausages are pretty good.  The regular fries(not the cajun fries) are also outstanding!  We always bring the left overs to our house and eat with rice the very next day.., was as good as the day before...\nMy only complaint will be on my second visit, there were not much sauce in my bag comparing to the one that I had previously.  I think I enjoy having my 1pound of shrimps at Boiling Crab even though I will be smell like garlic all day, LOL\nMy sister wants to take it to go, freeze it , and bring it to Korea for her husband... I asked her, \"" Is that so good?\""  and she replied, \""I'm so sure that I 'll be craving for the shrimps more than missing you!!!\"""
0,"Goodness. I am sooo sorry to give this place 1-star. I mean, if you're gonna come here to wash the dog yourself and just need the space and materials, OK. But do not come here to get your dog \""professionally\"" groomed. I usually go to Best in Show, but since they were closed I gave this place a shot, and now my dog has the WORST hair cut.\n\nLuckily, she's still a cuite patootie.\n\nFirst of all, my dog is a pomeranian and poms do not need clippers involved. The woman meant well but she was clearly in over-her-head. You do not shave a pomeranian who is supposed to have long hair. They've got two layers and need to be hand cut. This is why I go to a pro. If i wanted to just give my dog a shave and call it a day, I would have. She wanted to show me what she was gonna do and SHAVED my dog's head right on the spot. She will say I OK'ed it, but I totally did not and she kept offering this easy shave method... URGH. \n\nMy biggest regret is not sticking to my gut. Now my dog, that took nearly a year to grow out her cutie-patootie hair has to start from scratch. To make things worse, we expected a bad haircut and felt defeated, and when we went back in, it was THE WORST hairdo my dog has ever had. In all the west coast. \n\nThe groomer is a sweet lady, but she does not know anything about dog upkeep, my dog's butthole wasn't even cleaned and shaved around as ALL OTHER places do. DO NOT COME HERE for professional service you will be disappointed."
0,I have never written a review on yelp. I actually signed up for yelp simply to write this review. I have been to some of the best and worst places all over the country. I travel quite a bit. The service and unfriendly staff needs to be fixed. Waited 20 minutes before someone even looked at me. The chili was awful. But the beer is fantastic. Awful service!
4,"One of the best massages I've had, well worth the charge.  Melissa provided a very professional massage.  I asked for a 90 minute deep tissue massage and she delivered a wonderful massage that got the kinks, knots and stiffness out of my body.. I'll be back and would highly recommend."
0,"We went here before going to the airport on our last night in Vegas.  Food was just okay, but the service was TERRIBLE despite it being a slow Monday night.  The waiter was young and inexperienced (and since we were a party of six gratuity was already added so he must have thought he didn't need to try hard).  It wasn't until after I got home and checked my bank statement did I see that he had helped himself to $103.00 tip.  My receipt shows a bill for $33.00.  After calling the manager several times with no response, I will be filing a fraudulent claim with my bank.  Just thought I would let fellow diners know that there are so many better options on the strip and customer service here is severely flawed."
1,"We went here last weekend for a friends bday. We had a party of about 12 and the service was so slow. They also got some of the orders confused as to who got what. The food was just ok and the portions are not that big. The one thing I did enjoy was the Mac and cheese. It was to die for. Overpriced.\n\nOh and I almost forgot that they ran out of makers mark and offered us another brand so we said \""ok\"" not knowing that those drinks were almost double the cost of makers and they charged us for it!!!!!! Insane"
1,"I don't know if I trust these people 100%.  We had a compressor motor go out and they replaced that and we signed up for a service, a day later we heard a knocking and the when the motor was replaced the fan was misaligned so they had to come back out and fix it and they said they thought it was like that before.\n\n6 months later when my 2nd check up came (free under the service agreement) they came out and I wasn't home and they told my wife they we were low on coolant and there was a leak in our condenser.   They just wrote on the receipt leaky in the compressor needs new unit call us $5k.\n\nI never called but they sent me a brochure in the mail a couple weeks later.\n\nOf course now I'm paranoid but the AC has been working fine."
3,"A while back I was driving along Eastern, and saw Bread and Butter as I drove by. It's in a strip mall (as most places here in Vegas are), but it looked interesting from a far. I don't know if it was the lettering, or maybe the name, but when I joined Yelp I saw all the great reviews and decided to bookmark it. This morning, Sunday, I tried it out...\n\nI got there around 8:30am, and to my surprise there wasn't a line! I must have gotten there right at the right time because about 10 minutes later groups of people started piling in. Being that it was my first time, I didn't really know what to expect. Let's just say I couldn't wipe the smile off of my face. I walked in and was greeted by multiple upbeat employees, and as I looked around at the tables, everyone seemed so happy. The place smelled fantastic, and behind the glass partition was loads of delicious baked goods! If I could have bought everything, I would have, but I figured since so many people raved about the ham and egg waffle sandwich, I'd get that. I liked it, but it was almost too rich for breakfast...maybe if I shared it with someone I would have felt differently. If I were to get it again, I think I would get the bechamel sauce on the side and add it as I pleased. The eggs were light and fluffy, the waffles had good flavor, but lost their crisp due to the bechamel sauce poured over the top. Mine had bacon, I can't complain about that, and melted cheese as well.\n\nThe ladies to my right had cinnamon rolls that looked good, and the men to my left had waffles that they raved about! I want to give this place 5 stars, but I first want to see if the baked goods taste as good as they look... \n\nThere was a killer deal going on this weekend...buy a $10.00 gift card, get a second $10.00 gift card for free! I'm all for saving money, and bought a few. I'm looking forward to my second visit, and can't wait to give the baked goods a try...I'll let you know what I think!"
4,If your a fan of Michael Jackson this is a must see. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone but it's a must see. It was a visual orgy of colors stunts and music. Truly an amazing show.
0,The wait staff kept on telling us that the bread was on its way as it was in the oven after a 1/2 hour the bread comes out wrapped in a napking and it was ice cold stale rolls  (we laughed)
0,"The last time I tried this place was in Lone Tree, CO about 10 years ago. I didn't think it was great there, and it wasn't great in Vegas, either. I'm not sure what all the hype is about, and I'm not sure how they've been voted best burger in 29 cities-- unless Vegas and Lone Tree were not included in that. \n\nThe service is SLOW. Granted it was a Friday night, but there seemed to be plenty of people working there and yet it was impossible to get a drink refill. I ordered a milk shake- definitely the hi-light of the meal- but it came so far ahead of the meal I was almost done with it and felt sick before food even reached me. \n\nThe food... I've had better at so many other places. I ordered a build-your-own chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce, cheese and bacon. The chicken was tough and over cooked, the bun cold and hard, not enough sauce and the skimpy 2 pieces of bacon were over done. I had about 3 bites before my jaw gave out. \n\nThe fries? Undercooked and cold. COLD. WTF? It's a busy Friday night and you bring me a basket of cold fries with my already sucky sandwich? Ugh. \n\nWe ordered the grilled cheese for the baby. I didn't think you could F that up, but apparently you can... by bringing it out without the cheese melted. WHAT? How can the bread be warm but the cheese still stiff? Needless to say he didn't eat it. What a waste. \n\nMy husband got a burger that was uneventful. He said he's had better, but did manage to finish it. He's the only one that actually ate. \n\nI would not recommend this place or go back. There are so many other better places in Vegas for a burger that wasting your money on this crap would be stupid."
0,"My family went there to watch March Madness and get quick bite to eat.  My husband raved about their beers and he said the food is ok so my daughter and I decided to give it a try.  I ordered fish and chips, my daughter ordered a burger and onion rings, my husband ordered sandwich and onion ring.  We waited long time to get our drinks and food.  When we got the food I was very disappointed.  My fish was so greasy that I had to blot out the oil on my napkin which soaked my napkin.  My fries greasy and when I picked it up it was limp and very salty.  My husband gave me his onion rings and it was same as my fries (greasy and salty).  It looks to me they just dropped the fries and onion rings for few seconds and took it out.  My daughter said her burger was worse than Mcdonalds burger.  I had to flag down our waitress as she never came by to see how our food was and told her the fries were uneatable and would like a sald instead.  I only asked for olive oil and lemon wedges and my daughter asked for ranch dressing for the burger.  The lettuce in salad was wilted.  I was only able to stomach couple bites.  When we finally got the bill she charged us for the Ranch dressing.  When I sent e-mail to Zipps the response I got was that they have the highest quality food and the prices area very reasonable.  It is customary to charge for side of Ranch and that they hope I would give them a try again.  I don't think so."
2,"After eating here a couple time this last experience was lack luster. The beef tarter rolls were so disgusting we didn't even eat more than 2 bites. It was slightly warm, mushy, and the texture made my skin crawl. The signature sea bass is why I usually like coming to eat here and it's been always great in the past but the combination duck fried rice was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out. The fried whole fish was pretty good, I ate everything from the tail to the eyeball and was pretty pleased with it. The duck rolls were bland and our lobster rolls were tasteless and chewy which wasn't good at all. During this last dinner at Tao we ordered $240.00 worth of food between the 2 of us and was only happy with the snapper, miso soup and sea bass. The appetizers were all a disappointment and even our 4 drinks weren't made to our liking. \n Although I've had a good experience at Tao before, this last one wasn't good at all. Not sure if we will return again but who knows what will happen while in Vegas right?"
4,"This was the best Thai food I had ever eaten! We were in town for a conference and once we discovered this place we kept on going back, we didn't care if it was lunch, dinner, or if we had more Thai food than we had ever had in a row. We just had to have more. So delicious. My favourite was a vegetarian green curry with mango dish."
0,"Saw very good reviews on Yelp so decided to go there for one of my bachelorette pre-party dinners.  The interior design was excellent and very nice setting for fine dining, but I was really disappointed at their food quality and table service.  \n\nWe ordered all of the specialty rolls and none of them are close to my lowest standard for sushi.  I can get better quality at any of the sushi take-out places in SF.   \n\nBesides their bad taste in food, I felt very stupid that they had to sit us next to another rowdy bahcelorette party.  Those girls were annoying AS HELL!!!! I am not saying that we weren't loud but why put us together when there were plenty of room?? They should have thought about that and put us somewhere else at the first place.  I made the request to sit somewhere else and they put us in a private booth, which was cool.   \n\nThis place is such a rip-off and totally overrated! Do not recommend coming here."
4,"Stopped here after visiting the Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarium. \n\nA friend and I were driving down Litchfield Road looking for some place to eat and I saw it out of the corner of my eye. My friend was like, \""Hey, why not....\"" and into the parking lot she turned. \n\nLike other people have said it's not the most spectacular looking place from the street...plopped at the end of a shopping center. I wasn't expecting much....but it kind of turned out like a Susan Boyle.....that whole judging a book by it's cover thing. \n\nService was prompt and attentive. It's a small place and it didn't seem too busy. We sat on the patio and I have to say that parking lot is the QUIETEST parking lot of any shopping center I've ever been in. Very relaxing. \n\nLike I said, I wasn't expecting much and wasn't sure what to order. I was torn between a few things and ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo. As soon as I ordered it I was like, \""Ugh...why did I order that?\"" It's just sometimes a restaurant will make a fettuccine alfredo that just leaves a strange aftertaste in my mouth. Don't know if it's the cheese they use or what. So, like I said, I was dreading it. That whole Susan Boyle thing I alluded to earlier. \n\nStarted with some bread and a small salad with a creamy Italian dressing. Pretty good. \n\nThen out came my fettuccine alfredo. It looked good....and it smelled good. And I have to admit it was the BEST fettuccine alfredo I've ever had. Creamy, rich, and oh so good. I was SO happy I ordered it. \n\nWe ended with a creme carmel for dessert which was just right to top off our dinner. \n\nAfter dinner went inside to use the restroom and the restaurant was even smaller inside than I thought. \n\nChatted a bit with one of the employees about the restaurant and the owners. Very friendly and warm atmosphere. \n\nI don't get out that way much but if I'm around there again I will definitely stop in again. Thanks, Bella Luna, for surprising me with a great dinner. \n\nMoral of the review: Don't judge a book by it's cover....a singer by the way she looks....or a restaurant by it's location. Really. Don't."
0,"Villa's, i'm not sure what the hell happened, I use to enjoy your food, it use to be clean, and you use to actually have a value. well not anymore. sadly I went in for some thrifty ice cream today. for what ever reason thrifty has the bast mint chip to me, i wanted 3 scoops, what I god was a pathetic excuse for 1 maybe 1.5 scoops if you stretched it. I don't know whats going on here but it needs to change its getting ran into the ground. not sure if its a management problem or owner problem but i'm not coming back."
0,Terrible!!! 2nd time we have ordered from this location. Wait over an hour both times and we live less than 5 min away. Main thing is taste is disgusting. Taste just like store bought digiorno. Hard crust. Way more crust than cheese and just no flavor!!!!  Going back to dominoes &/or papa johns
2,"I had an evening event at Lake Las Vegas and we both booked treatments at the promotional rate during Spa Week. Highly recommend Kwang and Shere for massages and Angela, aesthetician. With your spa treatment, you get privileges at the hotel's terrific outdoor resort pool and the spa's gym as well -- an added bonus. We'd go back because the treatments we received were among the best we've had - anywhere. Just terrific. Highly skilled staff.  Very friendly and helpful staff in the lounges, too. We also love the property and Lake Las Vegas itself. For someone visiting the spa with a significant other:  Some of the spas we have visited in the past feature co-ed lounges and other areas. This one does not -- other than the gym and outdoor pool.  No bottled water - just cups -- even in the gym from what I could tell. I drink a ton of water when I run on the treadmills, so if I came back I'd bring my own bottle to refill. Also, if you like to read and relax before or after your spa treatment -- as I do -- women should bring their own book or magazine. It's possible I missed them, but on the day I visited, no magazines in the women's lounge, although my husband said the men's lounge had magazines, etc. -- even a TV.  And sauna but no steam room that we noticed on either the men's or women's side.  Again -  had a great experience and highly recommend this spa.   I noticed they have a special promotion for massages during the week, too."
4,"Body Heat has kick started my fitness like no other workout facility has done before. I have started running, cross training, and  overall fallen in love with fitness. I am in love with with the classes and yes they are all Hot. The facility is very pretty and well kept, at times I wish there was a little more emphasis on sanitization but that's just me. \n\nI never thought I would love yoga but it has become the best part of my day. I also enjoy the hot Pilates, kettlebells, and bootcamp classes. Their candlelight class is a great way to unwind on Friday nights after a hectic week. Body Heat has become my sanctuary."
1,"The only reason I am giving this restaurant two stars is because the food is good.  Otherwise, I am repulsed by how bad the service is.  In such an upscale restaurant,  I expect more from the wait staff.  We waited for approximately 10 minutes before bread (4 slices) was brought to our table.  When we asked for more, we didn't get it until after our food arrived.  Once the food arrived, we cut into the steak and the waiter asked if we needed anything else. We never saw him again until 15 minutes after we were done eating.  We had dirty dishes on the table until we got our check, and the pen that they wanted me to sign the check with was covered in oil that was given to the table to dip the bread in.... \nHORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!"
0,"TWC IS THE WORST!\n\nUnfortunately, TWC has basically monopolized the Charlotte area.  I am very jealous of all the people who have AT&T Uverse available to them.  I have contemplated DirectTV because TWC is so awful.  Every few months the \""promotion\"" on my plan runs out and when I call they say they are giving me the best possible promotion that they usually don't give to any other customer by taking $5 off...how generous.  They really don't care if their customers are unhappy because they know they have no other choice for digital TV.  If you have other options, USE THEM!"
4,"Really enjoyed our dinner here with my wife. Is it pricey, ya... But that shouldn't come as a surprise. I had the seabass which was GREAT. Wife had the filet which was good. We got two sides fried Mac and cheese and cream spinach(probably should have only gotten one since we were both stuffed) but both were great so not sure which I would have chosen if I could only choose one! The place they really get you is on liquor. Two drinks was $26 so drink before you go in!"
3,"Great service. Good Pizza. However, the sweat tea needs help."
3,"The staff here is always extremely friends, burgers are very tasty and their milkshakes are to die for .... rewind to the scene in Pulp Fiction where Uma Thurman asks for a $5 milkshake.  There is no bourbon but these are some fine damn milkshakes!"
0,NEVER USE THIS COMPANY!\nSimply called for a quote on a simple door repair and was turned down because Owner/Manager did not think it was worth his time??\n\nUse Vortex and save yourself the headache!
4,"We walked in on a Sunday morning, we're seated immediately. The wait staff were excellent, as was the food.  We had 2 more join us and the waiter pulled over another table-no problem.  Some of the best service I have had in recent years in Vegas-sweet!"
2,"A cute little industrial brunch spot with healthy breakfast and lunch options \n\nService is okay\nThe girl at the front was very brief and didn't really explain how ordering/seating/beverages worked but we figured it out\nThe menu is on your immediate right when you walk in and there are paper menus on the counter (tip)\nComplimentary water on the SW side of the counter-bar\nOur server was very nice\n\nToday I had the egg salad sanny and it came with chips and pickled cucumbers \nIt was a pretty decent meal\nI thought I would expect more for the price but I guess it was the area\n\nAlso, there is a little kid section\nDon't get me wrong, I love kids\nBut this restaurant doesn't seem very kid-friendly... Or at least that's what I think with the heavy steel chairs with that flooring...\nThere were many children there this morning and aside from the screaming and yelling...\nThe kids were rearranging furniture and such... My main concern being the chairs and tables... Not very kid-safe...\n\nI am not sure how I feel about this place, it's cute, perhaps I will give it another go soon... \n\nStay tuned Yelp"
3,"UN AMMO is straight up. The prices on ammo are not arbitrarily raised by retailers- prices are up at the source. When a retailer pays more he must charge more.  If you can find it cheaper- buy it, don't blame the store owner for the repercussions of your poor candidate selection last November.  When Cabela's, Walmart and Bass Pro Shops are completely out- UNAMMO has some.  These guys are knowledgable and helpful."
4,"Happened to be in the neighborhood when I spotted Cafe 25:35... Really glad that I did! Ordered three hot sandwiches to go for lunch: The Southwest Chicken, the Pork Loin and the Ultimate Grilled Cheese. All three were FANTASTIC! Even after making the 20 min drive home with them, they were still ridiculously delicious. I was impressed with the cafe's staff as everyone was very friendly even though the place was packed and they were busy. Only downside... Their cinnamon rolls were sold out by the time I got there! Will definitely be back with my family!"
2,"Kinda disappointed by this place. I had been raving about this place before my Vegas trip and was highly stoked when I finally got to try it my last night in Vegas. I should've eaten at the restaurant rather than taking it to my room at Caesars. By the time I got back, my sandwich had become a hot mess.\n\nI had the Woody Allen, half pastrami, half corned beef. The meats were ok, but it was nothing out of this world. I had been expecting a plethora of juicy and cured flavors, especially since I'm a big pastrami enthusiast. The experience wasn't really helped by the really high prices. The service was ok, mostly because I think the manager was present and the workers wanted to look like they were busy. All in all, I would probably give this place one last shot the next time I'm in town, because I think it has potential. I'll make sure to dine-in instead. \n\nPS\nDear lady who cut in line in front of me,\nYou're lucky I'm a well-mannered guy and that I don't like to cause a stir. But I sincerely hope you lost all of your life savings and social security money at the slots!"
1,"This only gets two stars because it wasn't the worst meal I ate in vegas (that goes to the rainforest cafe). \n\nWe only ate here because we had a groupon. After reading other reviews I'm not sure whether gratuity was automatically added to trick us or because we had a groupon. Either way 18% was added and then there was a line to add a tip! No thank you! The waitress was good enough. She paid a lot attention to us, which wasn't hard since there were three or four tables at 6 PM. I have a feeling that she automatically adds tips to everyone's check so she can manage to make a living. \n\nThe food was edible. My husband had far more complaints than I did, from raw vegetables to lack of shrimp on his dish. My food wasn't great, but it was hot and freshly made. \n\nI wouldn't eat here again if given the opportunity. There are plenty of delicious places to eat in Vegas, and that includes planet hollywood. Look around, there are other cheap options too. \n\nOn a positive note, they make their ranch in house and it is pretty tasty."
0,Wasted my time going there at 658pm Friday night when their website said they closed at 8pm.
2,"Very nice bar and the prices are very reasonable, if they put 2 (diamond) tables in there instead of 1 bar table and 1 build at home type pool table it would make this bar a very awesome place to hang out at and take pool league teams all week 24/7."
3,"Linda S. does not wait in long lines for food...except today. Today was about subjecting my family to driving across town to a long wait inside a smoke filled casino which has surely stunted my daughter's growth...all in the name of PAN ROAST. I would have lived the rest of my life ignorant of such a dish, but I became aware of this PAN ROAST in my quest for clam chowder in Las Vegas. The name itself brought images of a sort of pot roast, and of course this is sooo not even close.\nI've been to Palace Station for conventions and would not have guessed I would be dragging my family here to eat on a Sunday afternoon. Crazy. I was hoping the line wouldn't be too bad, but we ended up waiting 1.50 hours to get our food. About 45 minutes into waiting, I noticed the 21 & over sign, so we inquired about take out since we had our daughter with us. They do offer take out but we would still have to wait. They only have about 18 seats at the bar. 18 seats plus 13 people ahead of us translated into about an hour to be seated.\nI was especially curious to see how they prepare the pan roast. They use special steam pans and the food is cooked right in front of you. The chef was very jovial and interacted with patrons. Maybe if he just cooked, it would go faster. But the customers seemed to enjoy it and the servers were very nice.\nI am terrible with remembering chronological order but here is my account anyway. If I missed anything, please feel free to let me know as I would like to attempt this recipe at home :) \nFirst came a scoop of butter, then garlic and chopped veges (looked like onions, celery and red peppers). Then I think he added the fresh seafood, followed by a ladle of clam juice. He let it cook until bubbly. Next came the sprinkle of chili powder to taste (1-10 level) and other seasoning...possibly celery seed. He let it cook some more. Then a splash of brandy and white wine. Finally a healthy ladle of a creamy red stock. Cooks it some more until hot and bubbling. The last step that put a smile on everyone's face was when he tips the pan into the bowl, puts a scoop of white rice and serves it up. The long wait is over :) Nom, nom, nom! Be careful not to burn your mouth as it comes out very hot.\nPAN ROAST is a delicious and creamy seafood stew full of flavor. The combo pan roast has shrimp, lobster and crabmeat. Not at all fishy and very satisfying. The broth is rich and so flavorful,  you won't believe that you finished the entire thing...I know I didn't.\nThe CLAM CHOWDER  is one of the best I've had. Creamy but not heavy. Tender pieces of clams and small little chunks of potato (not too much). Another winning dish here.\nI am happy to say that I would venture another trip to the Oyster Bar for the PAN ROAST and Clam Chowder."
2,"i love how late this place opens, as most places are in Vegas. Lots of taiwanese food, but unfortunately, the food tastes so-so. the only reason i went back multiple times is because they serve stinky tofu, a dish very hard to find in the Southeast."
1,"The service was adequate, and menu choices were a little more than a little overpriced. I ordered the street style pork sandwich, the pork was pretty much the equivalent of a blue rare. The sandwich was the size of a small biscuit, and depressingly unfilling. Before this, i had ordered a pork taco with green salsa (forgot name, sorry, this review is written in retrospect), and the pork was well cooked, except that the taco was soggy as a result of the pork grease. My friend had dim sum, so size wasn't much of a problem for her, she did say though, the dim sum had an off-putting oder, but tasted fine. Overall, the place was sub-par and I wouldn't go here again. Another note: The drinks offered there are served in bottles, which means no free refills. Just know that these bottles are the size of a soda can, and depending on what you order, you may or may not be getting less than your money's worth(or even less still), as some of the bottles are smaller than others. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, overpriced and the food is repulsive."
3,I would not normally spend time reviewing a chain restaurant like this but \nI had to after the service I received there this past weekend. My husband and I ordered online before heading over there. We asked for our salsa on the side and were a little bummed when we got there and it was actually on our items. The cashier was very accomodating and quickly had our order remade and gave us a free drink while we waited. He also gave us extra free chips with our remade order. We were very happy with the customer service at this location!
0,"The most horrible restaurant experience I've had in Montreal!\nIt was the definition of dirty, with the chairs torn apart and the tables barely standing the weight of the food. The food itself was the worst part: we had a sandwich that was made with old chewy bread and a few flakes of meat spread on it. The hummus was OK, and the salad was nothing more than bitter lettuce with a bit of dressing. In the end, the waitress didn't even have enough change to return the rest of the bill, and I was almost forced to give more tip than I intended simply because I didn't want to wait for her to ask every single person in the restaurant for change!\nIf you're planning to have some good time, I think Shahrazad should be your last option!"
1,"Soooooo, there was an online article about Sweet Tea's that caught my attention. I decided to give it a try. First impression? The small waiting area/entrance had items of trash on the floor and newspapers in disarray on a stand. Once I entered the restaurant there were 4-5 employees sitting at a table (meeting?) obviously too busy to clean the entrance area. As I was seated by the hostess I noticed 3 more employees come into the restaurant, none of them bothered to clean the entrance way or pickup the trash. The floor of the restaurant was sticky in some areas and very slippery in other areas. Did I mention an employee's cell phone was near the cash register and kept ringing? (not to mention the ring tone was annoying). The food was mediocore. Terrible cornbread! The restaurant is 'drafty' so bring a sweater/jacket. The shrimp & grits dish is commendable yet I dont think they are 'Charleston' grits. \nLong short, I would not suggest you rush to visit Sweet Tea's....it's not worth it."
0,"I'm really surprised at all the good reviews of this place. We have been trying to find a good Indian place in the area and chose here because of the good reviews. The bottom line is that all of the food was extremely bland. We got the vegetable samosa,  shrimp vindaloo, Bangan Bhartha, and garlic naan. The vegetable samosa's crust was very hard and didn't flake off like I'm used to, the filling was average (this was the best tasting thing we got). The shrimp vindaloo was in a very watery bland sauce that reminded me of italian tomato sauce. The Bangan Bhartha was just unbelievably bland. The atmosphere of the place was not bad and the service was pretty good. I didn't even want to keep eating after the first couple of bites."
2,"After dinner downstairs we headed upstairs to the club.  The club is large.  It is a great setting.  The problem is that there are far too many people inside.  I am used to crowded clubs, but this is worse than most.  It is nearly impossible to get to the bar for drinks.  There is no way you could actually ever dance.\n\nThe DJ was great.  He played a nice mix of music.  The lighting and smoke effects were well done.  The girls in the tubs is a great touch as well.\n\nI will come back on a slower night so I can hopefully enjoy the experience a little more.  Saturday night is just too popular."
3,"We went to see the Hobbit a few weeks ago and discovered the $12 for a popcorn and soda deal - best part?  For the rest of the year it is just $6 to refill both.  \n\nWith ticket prices of $4.75 and $6 for soda and popcorn my wife and I can go to a good movie, enjoy a popcorn & soda, all for under $15.  \n\nEr, ahhh, in my case I guess I need to add a few more dollars to that as I am very fond of their pretzels!  : D\n\nAs opposed to what others have said I find the theater to be clean and well kept.  This is a great place to get a good deal at a great price.  Oh, the people here are very friendly to!\n\nI am a fan."
1,"I was pretty disappointed with this restaurant.  It's much better on paper than in actuality.  It sounds nice to eat overlooking the Venetian canal, but like the entire hotel, it's really quite bothersome hearing the voices of countless tourists echoing off the high ceilings.  The service is somewhat slow, and the quality of the food simply doesn't justify the price.  I have had better Italian food at Bucca di Beppo!  \nGnocchi with Lamb Ragout--tastes like glorified Chef Boyardee\nCalamari--cold, and pretty rubbery\nCod appetizer over polenta--too salty, uninspired, and somewhat bland\nSalad with pears, blue cheese, arugula & pomegranite dressing--couldn't taste the pomegranite, just tasted a little oily.  Pears were kinda mushy too.\nI have been to Il Forniao, and this is markedly worse.\nThe restaurant next door--Il Postrio-- is yards better (granted, it's also more expensive)."
4,I have only been here once but let me say it was one of the best times EVER! The whole place is sooo sexy and cool. Love the girls dancing in such amazing outfits..loved the free bubbly even more!\nI drank so much I ended up dancing on a table with some girl..the hubby loved that!\nI need to get back again because I had so much flippin fun!!
0,"I wanted to like this place, but the service was so horrible that it ruined my evening. Our waitress was blond and arrogant and really couldn't be bothered to serve us. She took our food order and then literally never came back. Our starters came and I bugged the delivery waitress for another drink, but soon realized that not only were we not getting our waitress back, but we weren't getting the rest of our food. Finally, after an hour we cancelled the rest and went to find dinner elsewhere. It wasn't just us. The rest of the guests were ignored as the staff sat and chatted among each other. Not worth the time or effort."
0,"So this weekend my 2 cousins and I decided we wanted to get our hair and makeup done at Platinum Entourage. We made reservations for 6pm for three people, assuming that we were going to get our hair done @ 6pm and then proceed to makeup done. Well we come to find that there is only one makeup artist and we all get our hair and makeup done at different times.  Most companies I have gone to in Hollywood they normally will have enough staff members to fulfill the clients' need, and not try to \""flip-flop\"" (that's what prick called it) everyone around because they only have one makeup artist. According to the prick, they just \""flip-flop\"" everyone around regardless of the time you made your appointment, so if you made it at 6pm chances are you won't be seen till 6:45pm.  So not only was that the stupidest business model for a company to have if they specialize in doing hair and makeup but the customer service was garbage. They were sooooooo rude about the entire situation. The receptionist didn't want to take any responsibility for the mix up, and the other guy was a complete prick in the manner that he spoke to us. To make matters worse they screwed up on the type of appointments, and then accused us of calling and canceling one of the makeup appointments!!!! I agree mistakes happen ALL the time, at first I wasn't upset until the prick came over to speak to us.  The manner that they dealt with the entire situation was disgusting, unprofessional and ignorant. NOW I can't say anything about the makeup artist because well we didn't get anything done due to all the screw ups, however, my cousin got her hair done and well it was nothing impressive."
0,"Worst. Barbecue. Ever.  We have been told by employees how great this Saturday night \""all you can eat\"" barbecue is for at least a year or so.  So we decided to finally try it and made a huge mistake.  We got there early, and waited while they brought the food to the steamtables - it must have been cold, since they were just carrying the metal pans and setting them in to warm up.  Then, when we finally got to eat - well, everything (except the chicken, which was swimming in sauce) was dry.  Dry ribs, dry brisket.  The brisket was also fatty and tasteless.  No real flavor to any of the meat.  Pulled pork was flavorless.  I guess they cook the meat, and then since they have a pan of barbecue sauce at the end, you're supposed to add all the sauce yourself.  How is that barbecue? It was way overpriced for the quality of the meal.  The only good thing was the coleslaw and cobbler, and that's not worth $13 a person."
1,"Never go on a busy morning!  We went on a Saturday at 9:30 am and they were out of a lot of bagels, all 4 coffee dispensers were empty and it took 15 minutes to get our food to go... after ordering!  It was a cluster! They gave our food to someone else and it took 5 minutes for the lady to make an iced coffee.. from the menu, not customized.  \n\nThe food was fine, but this quick service restaurant was in the weeds and super slow."
1,"Liquid is not for everyone.  If you're not interested in the hoards of people that party together at Rehab on Sundays, and you prefer to relax in a more quiet setting with less people, then Liquid is just right for you.  Not much goes on at Liquid and the drinks are very expensive.  It was $8 just for a bottle of water.\n\nAlso, the staff here is kind of rude and so I don't recommend wasting your time here.  The Aria pool is just as nice and much bigger."
1,"\""If it isn't you giving us your money, it's somebody else, so keep it moving...\""\n\nThat is the attitude that I picked up from the staff here at Tao Beach.  While standing right in front of the cashier waiting to pay my entrance fee she thought a text to a friend was more important than even acknowledging me or processing my credit card.  This would never have occurred next door at Wynn/Encore.  While I know and understand that the staff has to deal with out of control drunk kids they could have been a bit more professional and courteous, especially the young lady I speak of above.\n\nOnce inside the pool is tiny and the space is extremely tight and crowded.  I will say the DJ spins an incredible track and has some great mixes, but other than that if you're looking for a day party at the pool head North to Encore Beach Club and avoid this place.  Not impressed."
0,"If I could give this ZERO stars I would. My boyfriend had service with this company on a quarterly basis. They were instructed to call each time they were coming so we could have someone meet at the house to let them in to do interior and put the dogs away for the exterior. Right off the bat they would just show up and then call saying they were there when no one was clearly there to put the dogs out. They did this for months! Then they just starting leaving their service slip saying they did the back yard and would call to reschedule interior yet we never received a call. They could not do the exterior of the backyard due to a lock on the gate that we have so they were only servicing the front yard and not calling to reschedule anything. We tried calling them to find out what's going on and nothing got resolved. They then stopped servicing all together cause we refused to pay for a service we were not receiving. We then received a letter saying they wanted us to pay them the remainder of the contract (mind you a contract we never received) and it was no small amount or they were sending us to collections. I have since called them spoke to a Robin and I asked her to pull all the service tickets and also the so called \""contract\"" who informed me on 9/5 that she would email everything. 9/5 & 9/6 came and went and nothing received so I called and spoke to Robin again who told me give her til 9/8. 9/8 came and went and still nothing! Now, we have to fight with the collection agency because they wont cooperate. I DO NOT recommend them to anyone! I do not know of any pest control company that has contracts anymore other than 1 and that is only if you get termites. Other than that no one has contracts. They can not provide us with the signed service tickets nor this \""contract\"". Fed up and frustrated!"
2,"It was ok only. I ordered delivery and they messed up my order. They gave me egg drop, instead of wonton. The rangoon and general chicken were delicous. Other than that it was alright."
2,"Hit and miss with this store.  Sometimes I find everything I'm looking for and sometimes I find absolutely nothing.  What's interesting is that the cashier people are always so friendly, but you can't find a customer service person anywhere in the store.  If you do happen to find one, they won't know how to help you."
3,"Woah dude, whats with the chocolate fountain. Even in the debaucherous city that is Vegas, that thing stood out as way too sinful.\nDidn't feel like chocolate at 3pm ,so ordered the chicken tomato panini. Not impressed at all, although I did see others enjoying their sweet crepes and the various brioches at display looked nice.\nDoes it really cost the Bellagio so much to stock orange juice to justify pricing a small glass at $6, I don't think so!"
1,"The food at Big View is decent but the service is slooooooooow. Like, unbelievably slow. Not just during one visit, but on all of them. My parents also agree, they started going to Big View in hopes of something similar to the NY/NJ diners they were used to, and quit going because everything took way too long. Very disappointing."
3,"$3 margaritas? $3 for 2 beers? I'll take it. People say it's watered down? margaritas aren't really my forte, so I'm pretty weak when it comes to it. We were suppose to pregame before going to the Minus 5 ice bar on the inside of the Monte Carlo, and we ended up eating. \n\nThe appetizer platter is a meal in and of itself!!! Wings, calamari, potato skins, and something else can't remember. The bf bought me a yard of strawberry margarita...and I was drunk by the time we walked to MGM to play blackjack.\n\nFriendly service, I'd come back, food was pretty good!"
0,"Worst place to eat. Go somewhere else. They even Charged me extra for my 10 year because he was taller than 5ft. Terrible service, dirty and smelly. Never coming back again.!"
0,Truly disgusting place.
2,"My husband's family has a saying at mealtime: \""If you go hungry it is your own fault\"" and never has this saying been truer than at the Wynn Buffet. Seriously, if you can't find something to eat here then you are too picky to go out for a meal. We had breakfast here the day of my brother's wedding and it was quite a treat. The potato cakes with pepperjack were little squares of heaven and I could have made a meal out of them if I wasn't too busy stuffing my face with pain au chocolate. Lest you think I only carbed it up, I did try the delicious sausage with peppers and the perfectly cooked scrambled eggs. I think I actually squealed when I saw the olive tapenade and crostini and made sure that found its way onto my plate. Sadly, this tapenade left a lot to be desired, the salty tang that I love was missing and it was incredibly bland. But, that was the only misstep in an otherwise amazing meal. \n\nOnly advice? Get there early if you are going to breakfast because at 9:30 the line is pretty long although it moves rather fast."
1,"Came here for breakfast on a Monday morning before checking out of the hotel.  Breakfast was free because I had a $20 voucher.  They had your standard breakfast food, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, french toast, etc.  They also had a station where they cooked eggs to order.  Everything was just okay and there was nothing that stood out to me.  \n\nWould I come here if I didn't have a voucher, probably not.  It's an okay option if you're staying in the Monte Carlo, but there is much better out there."
0,"The ikea customer service and in particular in the Tempe store is the absolute worst. After months trying to get missing parts from a new bed that was missing from the moment i purchased it, and then ikea sending the wrong ones twice and numerous calls to the corporate office, I finally received the right parts. corporate office promised me a gift card for my troubles which I received today. It's a whopping $25. I feel like sending it back but will actually donate it. Save your time and money. Don't buy Ikea furniture."
0,"Oh, and if it doesn't bother anyone, they raised our rent over $100.  I would be fine with it if the value went up since I moved in, but the value of the property has not only gone down with depreciation, it is now a 15 year old property, and we do not have an office, a gym, nor a pool. So, my husband and I, who have just graduated college and barely could afford rent anyways, now have to figure out how to pay more.  Their pricing model has changed on the property in that they are now a competitively-based pricing model.  Once they match with the surrounding properties, they only thing to differentiate them will be the value of the property and the \""extras\"" they offer... Which is none.  So, good luck keeping up your vacancy rate when leases are up.\nMozel Tov."
2,"I don't know about the hotel but the Tournament of Kings was pretty cool.  My girl and I wanted to see a show and have dinner and what better then to knock the both out in one try.  This was really cheesy but that is what we like about it.  We sat in Spain, so we rooted for the King who was knocked out of the tournament second.  Oh well,  our dinner was very \""rustic\"".  A whole chicken, a big piece of steamed broccoli, some fried potato's, and goblet of tomato soup.  Which we had to eat with our hands.   Kazaaaaaah.  The acrobatic little gymnasts finished it out with an incredible display of athleticism.  Jumping and flipping like mad, mad I say!!  Ye show was fun,  but now on to a tavern for a pint of mead...."
1,Went on Valentines day and was major disappointment. Extra long wait for food that was very tasteless. We were shocked. Desert was also a disappointment.
0,Wasn't impressed at all. For price I expect better quality. Chicago style Pizza was burnt and wings where not even crispy.
4,"Love Love Love. There's not much to be said. If you make my coffee good I will love you forever. end of story.\n\nSuper fast service, clean quiet environment. They never make a mistake. I got free coffee from their drive through TWICE =-) because they said I waited too long. Thank you!!"
0,"I'm so sad to have to write this review.  I'm constantly reading yelp reviews but hardly ever post.  Visiting Giada, unfortunately, warrants this rare occasion.  I was so looking forward to an amazing dinner out with my husband last night.  After all, we were in town to celebrate my birthday at this dinner (we had these reservations for over 3 months).  We were seated in probably the worst placed table in the restaurant.  Right next to the waiter station.  My chair was kicked repeatedly in the 15 minutes we were there.  We sat at our table for 17 total minutes without even receiving menus.  Congratulations Giada, it took you a whole 17 minutes to ruin my birthday dinner and leave my husband and I scrambling for new last minute dinner reservations."
2,"It's a good ole southern home cooking joint on the west side. The biggest plus is the prices. Not many places still have dinner meal for less than $7 with 2 sides and a tea (their dinner specials come with tea). \n\nFood is typical.  Grilled pork chop is a little dry and tough. Better off with the fried pork chop. And when I said pork chop I meant super thin cut ones.  Country fried steak's gravy was the whitest I have ever seen... Thus a little bland.  It reminds me of comfort food people referring to when they talk about their grannies. Nothing against grannies (or moms), but I have found out in the 2 decades I have lived in the south that their cookings are normally pretty plain and non-eventful. But knowing so still doesn't stop us from wanting granny's pot roast because it is the consistency and thoughts and memories that matter.  What is off in quality at Gardenia is made up by the \""sweetie/honey\"" southern hospitality and down home appeal. \n\nIt's a solid spot for a low budget meal.  You will be happy if you have the right mindset and expectation."
0,Very expensive tourist trap. The food is pure crap.
2,"I would give it more stars, but I don't want the bar to get too crowded."
3,I really enjoyed my time here and the kids I brought song enjoyed it too! There are some planes that you can get inside of and volunteers to explain it all to you. The volunteers were so helpful! We were able to watch a plan take off from the airport. So cool! I really wish they had a restaurant for lunch. But other than that I really enjoyed the museum.
1,"The food is delicious. I've gotten the fettuccine alfredo and the 440 sandwich and both are fantastic. The only turn off is how long they take to make anything. You have to call in and order if you want to avoid waiting 30+ minutes. I've waited 35 minutes for a sandwich before which is simply not worth it, no matter how good it tastes. Definitely call ahead and order."
4,"Breastnet is a wonderful facility with wonderful people.  Here is my story:\n\nI was completely freaked out after my primary care physician confirmed she felt the same lump in my breast that I did.  My Dr. told me to call an unnamed breast imaging place that my insurance would cover.  They couldn't get me into their place until a month later even though it was to be a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound in response to finding what I thought was a lump.  My husband said we couldn't wait and he called around and found that Breastnet could see us on Monday (this was on the Friday before the Monday).  We were thrilled!  I was too anxious to make it very long.  I was obsessing.\n\nBreastnet was FABULOUS!!!  They responded to how freaked out I was and were very supportive.  The technician was very sweet and helped calm me.  The Dr. was so good with me.  She told me as she did the ultrasound that it all looked good.  I was so relieved.  I squeezed her hand in joy and she was very friendly.  I highly recommend going here if you need to get your mammo and/or ultrasound as soon as you can.  Also, the atmosphere is very calming in general.  Thank you, Breastnet!"
1,"Very simple, the food wasn't very good. I had the BBQ Bacon Burger - if there is a BBQ Burger on any menu I have to get it - its a personal gluttonous rule for myself. \n\nThe meat here wasn't very good at all but to top that, the BBQ sauce wasn't very flavorful at all either. The only good part was the onion rings, but everything seemed to be sitting in grease just a little bit too long like the grills and deep fryers need to be cleaned or something."
2,"Food Availability: For some reason we arrive between 5pm-7pm, their popular Honey Walnut or regular fried rice always seems to be out. I guess we just arrive after busy hours or early diners? I'm not sure but some food choices are less then a scoop empty (majority are full depending on demand) and some ppl must wait until a fresh batch is made depending upon demand. \n\nBeen here a couple times since its on the way home from work. I go here with a coworker during dinner time between 5pm - 7pm depending what time we arrive. \nPretty much slow with a few guests, and it's a quiet and settling atmosphere. We always seem to be served by the same person, a guy named Luis. He was very courteous and responsive to our food decisions.\n\nOverall, good place for a quick dinner. A star for convenience and 2 stars for Luis, his customer service skills is what keeps this place from having a lackluster dining experience."
1,"Meh.  I thought SLS was going to be ALL THAT.  But instead it was a flop for me and the crew I was with shared the same sentiment.  The industrial d\u00e9cor and architecture is a huge fail to me.  In fact, the words, \""goth,\"" and \""drab\"" actually come to mind.  Their attempt to be modern and perhaps retro-deco (if that is even a thing) was weak at best.  Why not just remodel?  Why not just retrofit?  It's like they ran out of money.  Also felt like the gaming options were weak, too.  Not a lot going on.  Best thing about the SLS is the restaurant Katsuya.  SLS - savor life slowly?  Ugh, savor life BORING.   We actually caught a cab to the Aria.  Better roulette and craps there, too.  Will only go back for Katsuya."
3,"Nourriture typiquement mexicaine. Rien \u00e0 voir avec les restaurants mexicains plus commercial, on est ici dans l'authentique.\n\nCe restaurant aurait tr\u00e8s bien pu se trouver directement \u00e0 Mexico! Par contre, comme c'est habituel la-bas, pas vraiment de d\u00e9cor ni d'ambiance, on y passe pour manger mais on ne s'y \u00e9ternise pas\n\nNote importante: pas d'alcool disponible sur place!"
1,"This place is decent if I got a craving for Gyros. Stay away from the Chicken Gyro though, that was not good at all. \n\nI dont think I would go back since I found one that was so much better in the Galleria mall in henderson. Kyklos is so much bettter."
3,"Quite honestly I hate the french but always enjoyed french pastries.  This place has a decent selection, not much on ambience in the inside, but well priced and quite tasty.  Only ate pastry, not any of the other foods they had there.  The service was good, pastries were fresh and well done.  Would recommend this place to cure the craving, but didnt look like they had fresh coffee, and just a case in the corner with a few drink choices.  Someone on here bagged this place for having to big of servings, dude seriously-GIVE ME EXTRA DESSERT ANYTIME! Shoot the pastry was only $5 and seriously why would you complain about a big tasty dessert?  They will let you take it home if you cant finish it, and if you cant finish one dessert, you probably arent worthy of this site, or writting any blogs food related.  I have an idea you should go sample at costco and write about the best pigs in a blanket you had there!! Wont be back to soon, but when a napolean is calling my name, this seems like a good place to cure the craving."
4,"I want Yelp to establish some serious ground rules in regards to buffets.\n\nIf you're a woman and weigh less than 150 pounds and you're a man and you weigh less than 185 pounds, you are not allowed to write buffet reviews. Seriously. Maybe Yelp should include a \""Do you weigh less than 150/185 pounds\"" as an additional business tip when it comes time to review buffets. Hating on a buffet because you because you don't like the general \""quality\"" of the food is like a fat guy (like me) hating on a tapas restaurant because I don't like the \""quantity\"" of the food. \n\nMaybe Yelp should include a \""Do you weigh more than 150/185 pounds\"" as an additional tip if you eat at a tapas-style restaurant? \n\nEnough ranting. All I can say is that Golden Corral is a slightly more expensive, but higher quality (in terms of food) buffet than Hometown Buffet. I like Hometown's seating arrangement better with it's ample amount of booths whereas Golden Corral seems satisfied to be primarily tables to get the customer in and out. As with all buffets, only order water as a drink so you can chow down more and don't forget to bring cash to tip the bussers/drink servers because there's no option to tip at the register."
0,"Well at least I'm not the only one!  \n\nBack in January a friend and I purchase the Deegie's Carma groupon which was $50 for a facial,manicure,pedicure and blowout.  Well my experience today wasn't even worth the $50 (plus the tip I had to give)I paid for the groupon.  My friend and I made our appts about 3 months ago (today June 18th) because weekends were already full up until now.  We arrived to the appt and were told that we would not be able to get out blowout because the \""girl\""who does them called in sick but that we could come back another day to get it.??  My friend started with the facial and I with the pedicure/manicure.  There were only 2 people working on a Saturday??  Per the groupon the facial was valued at $85 which on their brochure is a 60 minute facial. Both of our facials were exactly 45 minutes long.\nThe girl that did my pedicure informed me that she is actually a hair stylist but since the person who does the pedicures called in sick she will be doing it and that she will do her best.  She is telling me this as she is fumbling around looking for the things she needs to do a pedicure.  Well the only thing she could find was some cotton balls and a stick to push cuticles back oh and a file.  No clippers No cuticle cutters No nail buffer. So I'm thinking  Wow this is going to be interesting. So she filed my toenails, squirted some stuff on the cuticles put some lotion on my feet and painted my nails.  This is not the kind of pedicure I would have expected at a salon. Now onto the manicure.  She starts looking around for tools again as I tell her that my nails need cut.  She finally finds some clippers---cuts my nails, files them and paints them!  No soaking No cutting cuticles No buffing No hand massage.   Even the $10 manicures at all the walk in places do all the other stuff. Do people really pay $25 at Deegie Carmas for that kind of a manicure-I hope not.\nI then step into my 45 min facial (that supposedly costs $85!!!)  When we left there was no mention of us calling or coming back for the blowout and at the point both of us knew we were never going back to Deegie Carmas.  Both girls were very nice but all that really didn't help us for what we went for.  Where was the manager to rectify this situation!!\nIf Deegie Carmas was not ready to perform per the groupon that they decided to take part in then they should not have done so."
1,"Undercover Boss Fatburger was filmed here in April 2013....so I was interested to read the recent yelp reviews to see if improvement has been made. It doesn't seem as if people are impressed.... (I personally have received poor service the two times, I visited)\n\nHere is a cut & Paste from a review of the show....\nSo perhaps it's not surprising that as the latest CEO to appear on \""Undercover Boss,\"" Wiederhorn took to heart the troubles that an employee reported at a Mesa, Ariz., franchise. Posing as \""Myron Leeds,\"" a former real estate agent appearing on a \""second chances\"" reality show, Wiederhorn visited the Fatburger restaurant and found that the franchise was a mess.\n\n Angelica, an assistant manager, showed that the faucets in the kitchen couldn't be turned off. Sales were at an all-time low too, Wiederhorn conceded on-camera. And to top it off, the franchise -- which is part of a company that brings in $100 million in revenue a year and is looking to expand to 200 more locations -- has failed to pay its workers. \""By the time we get our paychecks, there's no money in the bank,\"" Angelica reported to \""Leeds.\""\nWhile speaking to \""Leeds\"" during a break outside the franchise, Angelica also described in detail the problematic culture at her workplace. \""The only time we see the owner is when something is broken,\"" she told him. There's no positive reinforcement: The manager \""doesn't come around see how we're doing.\"" And then the ultimate blow in Angelica's list of grievances: \""It's like I am working for you -- but why?\""\n\n Wiederhorn, for his part, seemed to take the criticism seriously. So in the reveal at the end of the show, he took the extraordinary step of inviting Angelica's manager, franchise owner Marcus, onto the set. And Marcus didn't put up a fight. \""I don't want to let you down anymore,\"" he told the assistant manager.\n\n As a way of helping to boost the franchise, Wiederhorn told Marcus that he'd forgive a debt of around $50,000 that he owed him. And then he also told Angelica that he would pay for her tuition so that she could attend nursing school, as well as give her a $10,000 bonus toward a honeymoon. (She's barely been able to take a vacation in the two-plus years she's been with Fatburger, which is about the same time that she's been married.)"
1,"Went here at the end of January on a Friday night and wasn't impressed.  The decor was a pistachio green with brown trim?   I get it, it's the theme of the casino, but doesn't really pop for me when looking for a place to eat.  In this case, we went for the dinner.\n\nAnyways, as buffets go, it somewhat small, as even many Indian casino buffets seem larger.   The food was decent, if uninspiring.  Nothing really stood out taste wise and the look of the buffet itself had a look not unlike a school cafeteria.   The buffet was rather lightly attended, patron wise, which made for a least a more relaxed sitting.\n\nWhat bothered me was that the help seemed really uninterested in their jobs.   One chef/server actually turned and walked away as  I and another approached the dessert bar, as if he had something better to do.  The guy manning the carvery saw that, stood at the meats for a while then came over, shaking his head.  Whether it was from thinking of his coworker or being bothered by having to cover for him I'm not sure, but it doesn't make for the greatest experience for a diner.\n\nThe table waiter did okay, neither distinguishing himself or taking away from the experience.   \n\nSo overall, I can't say this was a bad place because it wasn't.  But neither was it something I'd want to go back to.  Not when so many other better ones exist elsewhere."
4,"I just have to say that this location always exceeds my expectations. I also have to add that I am very glad to have this location in our area of town as it's worth the few extra minutes out of my way if it means avoiding the customer service abuse from the N. Decatur/215 location.\n\nLast week was my most recent visit. I was completely wow'd. So I'm making my way home and decide I don't feel like cooking so I call up this location and place a phone order with 3 meals. Two problems though...\n\nI just picked up my furchild from Camp Bow Wow, and it's sweltering hot outside. How am I going to go inside and pick up this food? Surely I am not aloud to bring her inside with me and surely I would never leave her in the car under the weather conditions. I sat in the parking lot contemplating  should I take her home and come all the way back or do I see if I can seek out a good citizen to watch my pup for a few min while I run inside and pay? NO! I can't do any of those things, am I crazy? No I'm not, just hungry. \n\nWhile sitting in the parking lot with my pup, I place a call to the restaurant. A super nice girl answers the phone, and I really wish I remembered her name so I could\nShout her out! I explained my situation and ask if there is any way they can bring my food to the car? She said YES without hesitation. She even acknowledged my pup and said hello to her when she came out to the car. \n\nSo to end this long story I was super stoked that this location just continues to be so awesome and provided above and beyond service to me and my pup. PLUS...my order was RIGHT!!! SCORE!\n\nAdd on from a previous visit on different date: I order all our food, get to the counter to pay, and realize my wallet is missing. It's dinner time rush. So embarrassed and with people waiting behind me, I ask the cashier if there  is anyway I can call my bf and get his cc # to pay over the phone. She says sure no problem (I think she could see my embarrassment and worried look). How awesome was that? They totally could have turned me away. Again with the above and beyond! :)"
3,Always have had good experiences at Prime.  They have high quality meats and good service.
3,"From scratch pastries, breads, breakfast, lunch, dinner options\nCozy coffee shop atmosphere, fireplace, plenty of tables.\nCash only. Pay at front and they will bring the food out to you.\nFree refills on coffee.\nNever dissapointed."
1,"I'll be honest, I am hard on Tex Mex restaurants in the Burgh. I want so much to believe that I will find a place that does good tacos and I am disappointed over and over again. Here's the thing about tacos that no one in this city seems to understand: the tortillas are the part of the taco that touches the tongue first and will be the source of much of the mouthfeel that you experience while chewing.  (Yeah, I am a bit upset with myself for using the word \""mouthfeel\"" but I wanted to use something besides \""chewiness\"" and my thesaurus is out of reach).\n\nI lived in San Antonio for years before moving to Pittsburgh and in most of Mexico and Texas a \""taco\"" is expected to be a soft tortilla (can be flour or corn) that is freshly made in house. A fresh tortilla makes a world of difference to the enjoyment of the taco. Some of my favourite tacos in the world are just plain, $1.50 tacos that are with some plain 'toppings' a good verde salsa, in a warm, fresh tortilla. I say all this because I think that Verde puts too much emphasis on the ingredients (Which are still under-spiced and boring with some store bought hot sauces on the table giving all the flavor) and then put those toppings into a boring, store bought tasting tortilla. So there you are spending $5 for a taco that's substantially underwhelming."
0,"Rude bartenders, rude busboys, poor production. The nicest person in the joint was Johnny at the front door when he refunded my door charge because of the miserable experience there.\n\nMy friend was able to coordinate with management about getting us in the VIP short line and a discount for the guys (ladies were free). Still had to pay $20 to get in, and the prestige of the Bellagio did not carry inside this club.\n\nFirst it was too dark in there. How can you set up a club for a ton of hot ladies in there if I can't see them? Even security had to shine their flashlights on all the steps everytime you walked by. Even the lights on the dance floor made it hard to tell if the girl 5 feet away was actually a 9 or just caked in makeup.\n\nFound an empty spot at the bar, couldn't find a bottle list to see what scotch they had. Bartender walks over, I ask her what type of scotch they have since I can't see their bottles in the dark. She drops her jaw and rudely says, \""I have 50 types. What do you want?\"" No offer of a menu, no suggestions, even my friend behind me said wow, what B*t$h. Alison, so it says on my receipt, did not get a tip for that overpriced 12-year drink. Maybe I caught this particular bartender on a bad night, but if I'm paying $20 or $30 just to be in there you had better offer some degree of service.\n\nThe busboys or servers or whatever those little guys in vests do literally sprint down hallways and push people out of their way. There is a bottle service delivery system that uses some weird blue diamond chariot thing carried by two guys and two girls with sparklers. There were no tables or extra dance areas, only two poorly lit go-go dancers. Overall, this club was not a positive experience.\n\nWhen we left after only 20 or 30 minutes, I asked to go back to the cashier but one of the eight suits coordinating door entry listened to my recap and refunded my money. That was the best part of my experience there.\n\nThe prestige of being in the Bellagio does not warrant a $30 entrance fee to the Bank."
4,"Oh my goodness, I have a new fav wing place! The wings were well cooked and seasoned. The sauce didn't drown the flavor of the chicken, just enhanced it. And their fried catfish sandwich was simply delicious. My family loved it and this our new wing spot indeed!"
2,"Great service, great food, priced a little high, and the coffee is horrible. They need a light breakfast blend instead of the sludge."
1,"i came in around 4. it was very slow. I got up and walked around the market and still didn't get anywhere on the list. they blow the hair around with an air compressor, talk about messy. I went in with black dress pants and got old man hair blown on my pants multiple times. the haircuts seems alright, but understaffing makes the wait beyond annoying."
0,"I've heard of Fogo de Chao awhile back and what I had heard were people going nuts about it, they loved it. Then it was my turn to try it out for the first time to see if what these people were saying was what it was all cracked up to be or not. Thank God I didn't pay the bill!!! I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses before but this I wouldn't rate it with the others at all. There was nothing at all special about the meat or in how it was cooked. I've had steak at other restaurants that weren't Brazilian and that steak was a lot better than here. The salad bar was alright, I think I was so shocked with the poor quality of the meat that the salad bar made no difference at all anyways, it was alright, a lot better than the meat if I recall. I was really really surprised and disappointed and of course expecting it to be a whole lot better than what it was, not good at all. Surprised and wondered what all the hype was about after all. Round 2: Went once again at the one in Washington, D.C. also, wrote a review on that one too, check it out!"
2,"Late post - this happened earlier last month.\n\nThe long awaited opening of Max's is finally here.  Here are my thoughts about this place:\n\n1) WAIT = The long wait was expected because of all the hype. No problem there...the only issue I had was when the host tried to give my spot in line to somebody that he knows.  When I approached him about it, he told me that he doesn't have a table for 4 yet he offered a table for 4 to his friends that just got there.\n2) AMBIANCE = the ambiance was good. Definitely a good family place to dine in.  They also have a bar inside which is a plus considering their location. It also set up nicely for private events as there are sliding doors that could separate sections of the restaurant.\n3)  SERVICE = The service wasn't as good as expected but given the fact that they just opened 8 nights ago (dinner only), I have to say that they have to do a lot of training specially their bussers. It took 15 mins before we got our drinks while there are at least 3 bussers walking around for plates to be put away instead of making sure that all the customers waiting gets their drinks first.  I finally called one of the staff which seems to be a manager or a supervisor as he wasn't wearing the waiter uniform instead he was wearing a blue shirt with a tie. I had to ask for our water and informed him that we are ready to order. After placing our order, it took another 10 mins and my husband has to asked another server for our drinks. Our waiter Lloyd apologize multiple times about the delay which is nice. He made the rest of our dining experience tolerable.\n4) FOOD = We ordered 1 full chicken, regular crispy pata, regular kare kare and bicol express and buko pandan for dessert.  The chicken was ok, I think the one in Glendale was better. The Crispy Pata was amazingly good. It was fried perfectly on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. The Kare-Kare was also good. The Bicol Express is perfectly seasoned and spiciness hit the spot. The buko pandan was delicious but the winner for tonight's dinner was definitely the Crispy Pata.\n\nOverall, the management should consider training their staff more on quality customer service so they don't end up a failure like Goldilocks. We, Las Vegans are quite particular with the quality of service and food since we are blessed with many upscale restaurants. I would definitely give them another chance and comeback."
3,"Although this store is often mobbed with people, I still don't mind sifting through the masses to find a killer deal. The best part is that they hand out coupons as you walk in. The coupons range from 30% to 50% off usually. This visit I was handed a 50% off coupon on handbags. If you like Coach, you'll love this outlet store."
4,"Amazing experience. Waitress was sweet, and the food was amazing. A novel eating experience, executed extremely well.\n\nWe tried the lentil and beef pastry appetizers and they were crispy and delicious. The lentil was MUCH more tasty than the beef. \n\nWith the entrees we had the lentils and the chicken entrees. As with the appetizer, the lentils were so much better than the chicken (which was really good). \n\nIn short try the lentils.\n\nWe also enjoyed the Ethiopian coffee which was special. Very hot and very flavorful. It was smooth as butter, but tasted a lot different than a normal Starbucks coffee."
3,"By Far The best buffet I've been to and that's saying a lot I've been to Vegas for years now and have probably been to almost every buffet at every major Hotel on the strip. It's not your typical buffet it's very chic and  classy from the plates from the pots I'd suggest fasting long before you come here.  Why?  Because you'll want to eat everything there and it would suck if you don't have room for it all.  Save room for dessert.  Seriously, don't think about skipping it, you'll hate yourself."
1,"Tried to sell a Tarentola annularis off as a tokay gecko. Two completely different species. Said he was lost in the store for five years before \""re-apprehending\"" a completely different gecko. They need to stick to fish, because their knowledge of reptiles is simply... lacking. I've been keeping tokay geckos for YEARS, but they refused to believe me. I will not be going back myself. The owner needs to open up his mind a little."
3,"This is my hands down favorite ayce sushi spot in all of vegas. I never leave disappointed and I know the menu by heart. The only downside is depending on the time you go their may or may not be a wait, however they have integrated this \""text you when your table is ready\"" system which is actually quite convenient. I mean the service isn't really all that great, but it is also not that bad so i'll live. Definitely one of the better spots to grab sushi in vegas."
4,"Living in L.A. and having a 2nd home in Vegas, I've noticed that home service providers tend to charge more in Vegas, and most deliver less.  After hiring A-List to clean my carpets in Vegas, my theory WAS PROVEN WRONG.   When scheduling an appt., I called on a Monday morning at about 7:30 and left a message.  Al called back immediately.  Per my request for an estimate, Al offered to come by and give an estimate; however, because I was out of town, Al gave me an estimate on the phone based on square footage of carpeting/  He scheduled an appt. for the following Sunday morning (since I was there only for the weekend), showed up early, was friendly, thorough, and TRUSTWORTHY.   His estimate was very competitive to other carpet cleaners, but he did not try to upsell me, and he actually charged me LESS than his estimate.  Most definitely I will use him again, and not because of his price, but because of the quality and thoroughness of his work.   AL, you and Aydin did a great job for me.  THANK YOU!"
1,":( So sad about my two-star rating... This used to be one of my favorites spots to eat. They have delicious Korean BBQ and they offer combination meals that include about 6-8 sizzling plates that is shareable for a big group. Service was quick and always accommodated us. But slowly things went downhill; they started cutting down on portion sizes and charging for extra things, like substitutions and RICE! Recently they have expanded to next door and added a sushi bar and karaoke rooms. I have yet to try either of those, but my suggestion would be to soundproof those karaoke rooms! Diners in the restaurant can hear it all, good or bad :X Guess I'll need to start looking for a new KBBQ place around Phoenix to get my fix!"
0,"I'm still on a journey to find my new nail place that's closer to home. I tried this place based on the amazon reviews, I found a coupon for a $23.99 gel mani, it was on my way home from work & they were able to takes that same day. I called ahead  & scheduled a 5pm appt, on a Thursday. I showed up 20min early (my errands didn't take as long as I was expecting) so didn't mind waiting. \n\nIt was now 5:03p & I was still waiting (5 appt, not a big deal). But then, a regular came in after me (they greeted each other by name). She sat by me for a few minutes, then was taken to start her mani before me! Finally at 5:15p, the lady (seemed like the owner) took me to a seat to start the process to remove my gel polish. I'm not big on talking while getting my nails done, but she didn't say 1 word to me. And she made feel like I was an inconvenience to her (even if I was, I'm paying you money to run your business). So after putting the tinfoil on, she said I'll wait 5minutes, that's standard. \n\nFinally, around 5:32 (15 min later) another girl, Jessica greeted me, apologized for the wait, & began. She gave me a small water bottle, cleaned her tools in barbacide, thanked me for waiting & did my mani. Jessica was sweet & the highlight of my trip.  Although, I am not satisfied with my French tip mani I received... We met at the register & I handed her her the coupon. Because I received French tip I assumed they would honor the \""gel mani coupon\"" but add an additional fee. Jessica spoke to the lady I assumed is an owner (the 1 who started to remove my gel). Jessica then told me they cannot accept the coupon & had to pay full price. Did I mention no where on that coupon does it list any restrictions?\n\nThe time was now 6:40p, 2 hours after I arrived, 1 h 40m after my appt time, I just wanted to go home so didn't argue. So, NO, I will never go back. It's a cute, small, clean place. But not only did I have a horrible 1st impression, it wasn't a good job. The polish didn't cover my full nail (looks as if some of my nails already 'grew out'), the white isn't even (looks like some areas are missing a coat), & there's a white cloudiness in some areas of my nails that are supposed to be the 'natural' color. \n\nI'm glad majority of people love this place. But my 1st impression was so poor, Pretty Little Nails is not getting a 2nd chance with me."
4,"Great selection, as one would exxpect from a Bath and Body Works.\n\nBut even better than that, great people.  They are always so helpful.  I will always come to this location."
3,"Harold's Corral in Cave Creek gets 4 stars just for being a Steeler's Nation Bar... All you Black and Gold fans dont miss this restauant and Steeler's museum.of pictures of the Steeler greats. Plenty of Pittsburgh memoriabilia. Harold is from the Burgh and treats his fellow hometown customers with class. The only draw back is the the food could be better. Its ok but could be better. Stop in and have an Iron City Light and ask for Harold.... Plenty of room with multiple bars and a large wrap around porch. Check out the sign on the roof of the restaurant ... \"" Heinz Field West\"" ... Here We Go Steelers... Here We Go !   :-)"
2,I rode along with a friend to Scottsdale for the day and she treated me to lunch. We ended up going to Stingray Sushi near the Fashion Square Mall. They have a great patio to sit out on and enjoy a nice day in AZ. The sushi was good we got a Vegas roll a Philli roll and a California roll pretty standard and then a order of chicken yakitori. Between three of us it was plenty and our friend had plenty left over to take home which was good. The Vegas roll was mildly soggy from all the eel sauce when it got to us and the chicken was dry but it still tasted alright. The service was pretty good both times i have been. I would go if i was in the neighborhood and wanted sushi.
3,"Aw, yeah! I never will go to County Market for my meat shopping again! Old Time can meet almost all of your meat eating needs and they do have a customer appreciation card where you get 10% off your next purchase when you purchase $200 worth at the store. Their sausages are quite good and their special flavors (applewursts you should try for sure!) change but they still have the classic bratwursts and mild and spicy italian sausage. Their flank steak is also good and their bulk italian sausage is also worth your while especially if you make spaghetti sauce from scratch. My complaint is that their hours and location could be better. Their staff is always helpful and they can help with getting special meat cuts."
2,The atmosphere is a great sports bar and convenient to Heinz and PNCs stadiums. The menu was very big though.  Food was OK nothing to brag about.  Most things were fried or greesy in terms of menu items.  I had a burger which was pretty good.  The fries weren't that great.  I'd go back if I was in area but nothing I would make plans for.
0,"I would prefer to give this dump 0 stars. Bad food, horrible service, and on top of that they tried to rip us off. Paid $175 for seats to watch superbowl with open bar service. The waitress was non-existant and we had to wait 30 mins/pitcher of beer at the bar. When we got our bill at the end of the game it included a built in 20% gratuity....$150! Took another hour to find a manager to argue with to get it removed. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."
1,"Not great.  Some mediums and some lows:\n\nCeviche - not that great.  Fish was kind of mealy and not seasoned well.\nBeef Tacos - the beef was VERY dry, some of it completely dry.  Seasoning was not noticeable.\nCarne Asada - decently seasoned, and not dry.  Nothing memorable though.\nChips and Salsa Bar - the best part.  Several different kinds of salsa, including a tomatillo/avocado, a \""spicy\"" red, and a \""smokey\"" red.\nTacos al Pastor - not that good.\nRice and refried beans - standard fare, nothing to make them stand out.\n\nI do like that they used Mexican crema for the sour cream.\n\nAll in all, qualifies as a \""Never Again\"" stop.\n\nP.S.  Had three co-workers with me, and none of them liked it either."
0,"I ordered the bite sized chicken pieces. There was a bone in the very first one I but into. It cut my gums up. I am very dissatisfied. Avoid this place,"
1,OK you all made me do it. With all the rave reviews I thought wow so I went.  Maybe because it was a Monday night I should have known better. I ordered the brisket platter and the meat was barely room temp and dry. The really terrific waitress apologized and brought me another portion and it was the same!  Not her fault but I guess you get leftovers on Mondays. I may give the place another try and diffinately on a different day. No excuse for not having hot food. The sides were good and the service great so I gave it 2 stars.
0,"A group of ladies going to Vegas for a fun weekend. We were excited that the hotel was located in the middle of the strip. It was very disappointing when we got inside and it was still being remodeled. Which is fine if they wouldn't have reassured us (twice) that it was finished. \n\nWe asked for adjoining rooms and were put in two separate towers.\n\nElevators had duct work hanging out. Electrical wires all over the place. \nOnce we got to our floor the wall paper was ripped, carpet torn, stains on the walls, and the worst stench!\n\nWhen we get in the room the smell was horrible.\nOnly two lights that did not do a good job of lighting the room. \nWhen we flushed the toilet, a sewer stench filled the whole room.\nThe balcony door was forced locked with a nail jammed in the locking mechanism. \n\nNot a security in sight!!!!\nI woke up early and went to the casino. On the way up I was approached by two individuals by the elevator. The elevator was in a location isolated from the common areas. The woman made me very nervous. She continuously kept looking at my wallet. I decided to pretend to have forgotten something and left the area. They did not board the elevator and left the hotel. I am convinced that they were going to do some harm once I was alone with them in that elevator. \nI went looking for a security guard and NOT ONE IN SIGHT!\n\nI have been to many hotels in Vegas and NEVER have I felt worse! The staff was not understanding at all. They promised a meal credit and when we tried to redeem it, it had not been \""updated\"" in the system\"" (shocker!).\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THE QUAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Giving this place a visit was wayyy long overdue. \n\nWe were all on a friend's guest list. Due to unexpected complications, we didn't get in line until a little after 10pm. So very long story short: Make sure the person who's name is on the guestlist is with you when ur getting in. The girls barely got in, and the guys had to pay. I had to tip the doorman a bill for the guys to just get in and still pay the cover.\n\nLesson learned: Pre-order tickets or get in line way earlier.\n\nThere's many different levels and sections. Think Tao Club on steroids. It was so crowded that I didn't get a chance to explore and see everything. I only got to see the bottom floor, which seemed crammed and not impressive, and the level with the main pool patio area and the main dance floor. I'll take Brian C's advice next time and get in earlier so that I can actually walk around and check the full venue out.\nWhen we were at the outdoor pool area, it started to rain. Great - it was already packed but now everybody was scrambling to get out of the rain to get in the already crowded insides of the venues.\n\nThe place was PACKED and beyond poppin, and in my honest opinion, I think in terms of being the most popular/desired nightclub, Marquee takes the cake in Vegas. As for the outside pool/patio area, XS still holds a strong edge.\n\nSo yeah, I think due to the negative circumstances, I didn't have a great first impression of this place that most people seem to have. I will definitely give this place another try someday soon and hopefully it'll be a little better.\n\nCliff Notes: Humongous venue, and even a humongous-er crowd."
0,Closed in under a year.... oh well Cream was better...
4,"Jayd is amazing at what she does! I highly recommend her! I went in and asked for a dark tan, which is what I left with. The Customer Service is great. She makes you feel very comfortable from the time you go in until the minute you leave. I'm a spray tanning newbie so she told me everything I needed to know about how to get it to last. She was thorough and my tan looked fabulous, tan, and even. I'm a bit overdue for a spray tan now. I will definitely be booking another appointment with her soon.  I highly recommend this place."
0,"I came here about 2 weeks ago for a co workers going away dinner. We came with a party of 11 people for all you can eat sushi at around 25$ per person (u do the math). With a party this large, we were invited to a secluded room right next to the entrance. Upon entering this room I was very star struck. I felt like I was walking into a beat down motel 6. \n1) there was dust on everything except for the tables and chairs. You could see dust from the ceiling and on the walls that probably landed in our sushi rolls & wallpaper was falling off the wall. \n2) there was a bloody Band-Aid on the floor. \n3) there was burn holes on the ceiling due from an electrical outlet (I believe) and there was a water sprinkler burned up and rotted. \n4) service was slow and the waiter did not know which rolls had been served because there was multiple \""food runners\"" delivering our rolls. \n5) the speakers did not work and were only for show.\n\n After all this discomfort I asked to speak with a manger. I asked the manager to close the door leading into our room. I asked him \""would you feel comfortable eating in a place like this\"". The manager looks around the room and says \"" yes, what's wrong with it\"". After pointing out the 5 things I listed above he did not know what to say. He hesitated and after about 15 seconds of awkward silence he asks \""so what do you want me to do?\"" I replied \""your the boss you tell me\"". He exits the rooms and comes back 4 minutes later giving me 2 options. Option 1- we can take 15% off the tab. Option 2- we can take off the gratuity (18%) with 4 free socke shots. Option 1 is not even 5$ per person. Option 2 screws the server by taking off the tip (even though the manager claimed all tips were pulled) & gratuity is 'illegal'. After must disatisfaction i asked to speak with the owner, i was denied multiple times because she wasnt there. Which was a lie, the reason i couldnt speak with the owner was because she doesnt speak english. I am a worker in the hospitality industry for multiple years and this is absurd. I was not expecting a free meal but more than what was offered for what my friends and I experienced.   I want to eat at a place that takes pride in their bussiness and loves their customers. This clearly isnt the place that takes pride in anything other than filth. In Vegas a review and word of mouth go a long way. I will never return to this place & I will gladly take my business elsewhere. I took pictures of the room and will upload them with my review (hopefully yelp keeps them up)!"
2,"I liked, but did not love, La Reve.\n\nAs others have mentioned though, that is probably because I had seen several Cirque shows before, both in Vegas and on tour.  \n\nLa Reve is pretty to look at and very well done... and there are elements that I truly enjoyed but it just didn't hold my attention the entire time like a Cirque show can. \n\nWhat I did like was the somewhat dark and mysterious nature of the show in spots.  The opening with the craggy, industrial looking tree and the acrobatics that take place on it, is fantastic to watch.  \n\nAlso the section with the angels (though some people have said \""doves\"" but my first thought was angels) reminded me of what I would think an angel would look like.  Not that I am particularly religious, I'm not... I just don't buy into sweet and gentle nature of angels that is so commonplace.  With that in mind, that particular part of the show was kind of like a Revelations type descent from heaven come to life, for me.  It was pretty breathtaking.  \n\nAside from that, because I am a dancer I love watching choreography of all forms and I love the demonstration of the human body and what it's capable of.  These performers are so strong, and so well rehearsed... it's really quite awesome.\n\nWould I go back and see it again?  No.   There really isn't a bad seat in the house, and it was worth my time.. I had wanted to see it for a while.. but all things considered I would prefer to see Ka next or go back and see Zumanity again.   YMMV."
4,Delicious donuts & pastries. Must try the cronut. On the weekends they have the cronuts and other specialty items. It makes you feel like you're at a small town bakery. Also a bonus that they have a drive through.
3,"I stayed here by the good graces of my best friend, who booked his wedding here.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  The bathrooms are luxurious; my room had a separate tub and shower, which were both quite large and immaculate.  \n\nI didn't give this establishment five (5) stars for several reasons: \n1. Wireless internet access costs almost $15 per 24-hour period.  For the price of the room, wireless internet access should be provided to hotel guests for free.  \n2. I took advantage of the hotel room tub.  (Yes, I watched the maid clean it, so I felt confident that it was clean.)  It would have been really nice to enjoy a small television or even some music while relaxing in the tub.  \n3.  The television in the room is quite outdated.  Surprisingly outdated, actually.  A nice, inexpensive flat screen TV would be more appropriate in the room than a small, old-school box TV.  And there were very few decent channels with relatively shoddy reception.  \n4. The in-room mini-bar amenities are far too overpriced.  A generous markup is to be expected, but the items were excessively... no, PROHIBITIVELY, expensive!  \n5. A complimentary shuttle service to/from the airport should be provided.  I don't care if they add it to the room cost--just make me FEEL like I got it for free. \n\nI saw the view from my friend's room (he had a view of the Bellagio fountains), and yes, it's worth it!  Trust me, it's worth the cost for the extra ambiance.  \n\nFront desk service is top-notch, though there wasn't a queue-style line for the desk.  If you're stuck waiting behind someone who wants to take forever, be prepared to watch people who came in after you receive service and leave before you get to the desk."
2,"My cousin and her fiance had their engagement party here on the Patio which connects to the lake and park. Never having eaten here before I don't know if I got the best impression from the pre-prepared catered food. We were served their sliders, sandwiches, fruits and veggies, and cheese and crackers. Nothing that could really make an impression! I thought the restaurant looked nice enough, but everything came off as a little bland."
1,"Decent food at an affordable price. We came to eat here around 1am on a Friday night when we first arrived in Vegas. It was pretty busy but we were seated right away. I shared the 7 oz. steak with hash browns, eggs, and toast with my boyfriend because I wasn't too hungry. The steak was OK at best - it was well done on one half and medium on the other, we asked for medium- but who's complaining for under $4? Hash browns weren't really crispy but the toast was good and the eggs were all right. Overall everything was lacking in salt; understandable given the older crowd. OK place if you're drunk or don't feel like going out to the strip but definitely not a destination eatery."
2,"I agree with Beth.\n\nThe building looks kind of cool, has plenty of snazzy neon signs and architectural \""enhancements\"" - but it really isn't a well-designed library.\n\nIf you like to browse some fiction and then non-fiction, with a trip to the computers (aka \""card catalog\"") in between - you feel like your bouncing around a warehouse that has some bookshelves in it.\n\nIt feels as if there will be a trendy coffee shop tucked into it at any moment."
4,"I have certainly had many facials in my life, as not being blessed with great skin. I had a facial last month at Globe, and it was in my top two of all time!\n\nGina was fantastic, addressed all of my concerns and didn't judge me for all my skin sins. From start to finish, the service was not only incredibly helpful (I got the baking soda Microderm), but thorough, relaxing, with all of those touches that are so easily missed in some facials. \n\nI know they are known for great hair, but anyone should run, not walk to have a relaxing facial at Globe. I'm counting down my days until my next appointment, what a wonderful place!\n\nThank you!"
3,Slightly above average mexican food. One thing that keeps me coming back is they have excellent hot sauce. Service is always good. Very friendly staff. They do make great nachos maybe I should add a star!?!?
2,"Nove was an interesting Italian place.  At the top of the Palms, I was expecting a bit more for the price.  Our meal was very expensive and unfortunately, I did not like what I ordered.  The server said the Seafood Spaghetti was their signature dish and honestly, I would be embarrassed if this were my restaurants signature dish.  Nove was a decent experience but I will probably not return.  I really wanted to love this place, but I just didn't."
0,"Art's was recommended by a family friend; however, after my experience there I am really wondering how often they actually used Art's. The guys working the front desk are super nice, but unfortunately the actual work there was absolutely no good.  The only thing they got right was a basic oil change. I have a 2004 Toyota SUV and I took it into Art's for the first time for some work and they replaced the shocks, did the oil change, and supposedly did some work on the brakes.  They charged us just over $1,000 for the work which was reasonable. I have no problem with that. A couple days after getting the car back it started making a really obnoxious squeaking and creaking noise when I braked, turned, went over bumps, or even got out of the car! We called Art's and took the car back.  The mechanic got into the car to listen to the noise while I drove and commented that he is \""not used to working on cars like this\"". I'm not sure what he meant, a Toyota is pretty common and basic! We left it there and it was quiet for about a day after picking it up later.  It started squeaking again, this time it was worse though.  We decided to pay and take it to Toyota AutoNation and they figured out the problem right away.  Art's had given us a defective shock that wasn't supposed to go in my type of car. I'm baffled on how they didn't realize this the second time around at Art's.  We took it back for the third time, told them what AutoNation said and showed them the paperwork, and they replaced the shock.  However, a couple days later the car was worse than ever and I was almost scared to drive it.  We gave up on Art's and went back to AutoNation.  The shock Art's used was STILL the wrong type of shock, and they told us my wheels could have come off while driving.  They also checked the brakes and apparently there was about a millimeter left on the back where Art's had supposedly fixed them.  My car is now just fine thanks to AutoNation's common sense.  I am very disappointed with Art's: It complete wast of time and money on incompetent mechanics and useless car parts."
2,"we stayed here for 4 days in august last year and it was an OK stay.  probably the last time i will stay here unless there's some supersale on the hotel.\nthe hotel is a bit older but since our friends were getting married at Mandalay Bay, and since we couldnt afford staying there, we chose the closed hotel so the 23 of us didnt have to go too far to be there in time for the wedding.\nthere were construction going on all wknd.  so annoying as we were ok w/ it on Thursday but it seems be pounding w/ those machine all wknd.\n\nthe pool area was small and was not \""pretty\"" as the other hotels.\nclub LAX is there and we all got in for free as we were staying there - one of the best part of the stay as there were lots of us and went in without lines etc. \nlike the ability to go to Excalibur and Mandalay bay on the tram without walking too much but the wait is about 15minutes in the hot sun :(\nour room was not that big...good enough for 2ppl.  if more, it will be tight.\ntheir food court needs more variety.\n\noverall, you really dont get that much but then again, you dont pay that much for the room."
1,"The exact definition of two stars: MEH. I'VE EXPERIENCED BETTER.\n\nAs for someone who LOVES Korean BBQ and always eats it every other week, I do not recommend this place for KBBQ. I've been to many KBBQ places, but I have never seen KBBQ to be $30+. It's not very surprising that this place would be $$$, I mean almost everything on the Strip is PRICEY. Since $30 for a very small portion of kogi was definitely out of the question, I decided to order dolsot bimbimbap instead. This dolsot bimbimbap was the most expensive I have ever paid for. There's nothing special about this place. I'm giving it two stars because the food was descent and the waitress was nice enough to be honest about size portion of the KBBQ meat.\nNever again."
3,"Getting into Tao VIP status is pretty easy, and when you don't have to pay to get in it makes it that much better inside when you have an extra $20 something in your purse.  And you still have your pre party buzz cause you didn't have to wait in that ridiculous line!!\n\nI went to Tao 2 nights in a row (don't ask) and Saturday was def more packed than  Friday.  My friends and I scored on a booth Saturday with some really fun guys, and did most of our dancing there since the dance floor is PACKED. We attempted to get though the crowd and didn't even have to move, the crowd literally pushed us to the other side. And then...Timbaland's \""The Way I Are\"" came on, foam comes down from the ceiling, the crowd goes wild!! It was insane and kinda scary.  \n\nNot too sure about the girls in the tubs its a little weird I think to have people rubbing up on each other in still water...ew.  \n\nSo long story short, get there early if you are going to have to wait in that line, best bet always is to make friends with someone who can get you in no line no cover...nice club, not extremely \""wow-ed\"" but gotta give 4 stars for the booth hook up!"
4,"I ate at Harley's for the first, of what will be many, time last night. The ambience is perfect. Romantic and quiet enough for a date, but still casual and fun enough for dinner with friends. \nWine, dinner, and the service were all great. I was a server for a long time and I know what crappy service looks like it. They don't have it here. Also, one of the owners hung out and talked to my friends and I and tended bar! I was very impressed at how friendly everyone was. \n\nLastly, if you haven't had their Bistro Bread you need to stop what you are doing and drive there right now. It is a secrete recipe of cheesy, gooey, garlicky, goodness on toasted bread. Delicious! I can't wait to go back their again. Maybe this time I will try brunch. :)"
1,"Ok call me weird but I'm one of those people that is always generating static electricity, and for some reason this walmart is like a tesla coil to me, there's something with the way the shelves and freezer cases are grounded that whenever I touch. Them, without skipping a beat I always get shocked and it's never subtle always a big pop and possibly some numb fingertips, I don't know maybe it's because I work in IT so my body has a natural charge, maybe I'm like the girl from Heroe's and I don't know it,\n\nAvoid this place if you have static issues, otherwise the selection is nice and I can't complain about a fresh sushi counter"
2,I enjoyed the novelty of getting my mercury on for $3 in a big cup. The shrimp were of poor quality - of that I am sure - but love the concept and they tasted decent.
3,"This place needs better signage.  The only reason I found out about it is because my neighbor told me about it and I'm in this little strip mall at least twice a week.  To think that I could have been eating here, but haven't because I didn't know about it, for the past year makes me a little sad.\n\nThe food so far has been very good.  No skimping on flavor going on. The green chili pork stew is wonderful.  The carne asada tacos pop with flavor.  The salsa bar is a great touch.  I can't wait to try the pozole this weekend."
3,"When you see line ups before the restaurant opens, it's a sign that they are doing something right. Schwartz's is a very small, busy diner with a cult following. My waiter was excellent, giving us great advice as we settled on the combo which came with fries. We ordered the coleslaw and had pickles on the side. If the seating wasn't so crowded and follow diners dropping f-bombs, this establishment would have received 5 stars from me. You should bring cash as they do not accept credit cards."
4,I had the pleasure of having lunch at Gordon Ramsay the Pub & Grill. The food was amazing. I ordered the fish and chips. \nThe cook on the fish was perfect and the chips were also perfect. I don't eat fried foods because most places don't use fresh oil or over cook the food. Not the case here. The flavors of the all the food from fish to the tarter sauce was amazing. The staff is awesome. I did have the pleasure of talking with Louie Maione the GM commending him on the food and service. What a great representative for the resturant. I highly recommend this place. Enjoy
0,I love greasy disgusting pizza so we eat Here once in awhile. The staff totally suck and now we just expect it and laugh. I think I saw a guy with a full beard and no covering in the kitchen. I checked for beard hair in my pizza and didn't see any.
3,Can never get enough! Please put more mushrooms on 4 dosen't cut it.
3,"Somewhat a new addition to the State Street boutiques, I went for the first time last weekend and bought some great stuff!\n\nI think this place offers some spa services as well, but I ony am reviewing the shopping.  When I walked in there were tons of cute, lacey panties by Honeydew in cool popsicle and lime patterns.  The walls are lined with handbags in all patterns...these make cute bookbags...they have things like hearts and monkeys.  There are adorable fitted graphic tees, jeans, tanks, and casual shoes and dresses.  There is also fun jewelry such as chunky rings and shell earrings.\n\nThe best part....the dressing rooms are in a little room with curtains and a comfy couch faces the rooms.  Mirrors are on the side.  You can try clothes and put on a little fashion for friends.\n\nI found some great deals on the sale racks and they have lots of clothes by Free People...one of my fave brands!"
1,"Sushi is ok but rolls are small and service is really slow.  I ordered 3 rolls, it took 20 minutes to get the first one, and they served them one at a time. It wasn't crowded, I was the only one at the sushi bar.   Go to Ginbu 401 instead."
0,"Wow will someone please pull the plug on this lifeless disaster of a show. When I saw this show it was being performed in the Night Owl showroom at Hooter's which is an awesome venue. It has since been relocated to a small conference room which I am sure does not help any.\n\nThank the lucky trolls my tickets were free! If I had paid for this atrocity, I would have been way passed pissed halfway to postal.\n\nI can not believe this is related to X-burlesque the female revue version over at Flamingo hotel and casino. The X-burlesque women are fantastic, respectful and talented and put on a great show. I don't see them grabbing men's bozacks!\n\nThe men of X not so much. This is a low class bunch they have selected for the show.\n\nThere is a thin line with this show in which it could be considered sexual harrassment. I kid you not one of the male performer's slipped his hand up my skirt in one swift motion. It happened so fast I could not even react fast enough to stop what had just happened to me. He literally touched my panties he slid it up so far.\n\nI went to see guys perform on stage NOT ON ME! I am sure there are many women out there in which this or incidents similar to it have happened, there is no way as brazin as this dude was that he has just done this to me and only me. \n\nTacky, unprofessional, disrespectful and Hooter's beware you could eventually have a lawsuit on your hands from these lude performer's you have made contract with for this show. I will vent on Yelp and leave it at that.\n\nAside from being molested the show was horrible!\n\nIf you want a great male revue show that will not let you down then go see CHIPPENDALE'S or my name ain't Nikki!"
1,"I should make it clear from the beginning that I had a hotel comp and didn't pay for the meal. If I had paid for the meal, I would be furious. \n\nSo here it goes- my partner and I ordered 5 items to share: \nThe sliders never came out\n\nThe braised short rib smelled and tasted foul. We each took a small bite and never touched it again. \n\nThe breaded and fried green beans weren't horrible, but they weren't interesting either.  I'm not sure what the dipping sauce was trying to be. Also, I think the oil in the fryer needs to be changed.\n\nThe flat bread took almost 30 minutes and was bland. \n\nThe only dish I would recommend is the duck tostada- but even then I have to say the duck was so bland it might as well have been over cooked dark meat chicken.\n\n\nOn the positive side- we ate at the bar, and aside from the sliders never coming out, the service was nice. The bartender was pleasant and quick with our drinks."
3,"Went to night had the spinach dip it was good but not really any spinach more like cheese dip. Also had the fish po' boy, good not great. Drinks were good. It's dog friendly which is always nice. Great ambiance. Nice for spring happy hour"
1,"JKL chapter 1\nApparently Eddie, formerly of Eddie Matneys, owns this new restaurant in old town Scottsdale. I went there with two of my friends who love eating out and getting their drink on. It was a Tuesday night about 8 pm. When we arrived there were maybe 2 other groups there. We were shocked. Despite the economy, Eddie has quite a stellar reputation in the valley. But we stayed all the same. \n\nWe sat at the bar and ordered drinks as we studied the menu. The bartender was friendly and knew his way around the menu. We started out with MoRockin' Shrimp with chili-beer dipping sauce and dough balls as well as the Golden Spaghettini Egg Rolls and cashew sauce as well as the Grilled Honey-Spiced Chicken Lollipops. At first I was quite unsure of the Spaghettini egg rolls with cashew sauce. The bartender offered some raspberry coulis to make the meal comparable to a peanut butter and jelly concoction (his words). Tasting pasta wrapped in an egg roll is disappointing and crunchy with no center to anticipate. The MoRockin Shrimp were pretty flavorful but my friends and I were confused by the dough balls. We were unsure if Eddie was trying to make a less expensive dish in light of the current recession. But the fact that we noticed it does not fare well. The chicken was by far the best with a good flavor and presented elegantly.\n\nI went to use the restroom and heard a voice in the stall. I was not sure if the person was talking to me, himself or someone else. No one else was in the restroom. I went outside for a smoke with my friends and Eddie the chef and proprietor approached us and thanked us for our business. He told me he recognized me from my shoes in the stall and that he uses the restroom as his office. It was a bit uncomfortable to have this encounter but we were confident that Eddie was in the kitchen that night. \n\nWe went back inside and ordered our entrees. Normally I do not order fish in AZ because it makes as much sense as mexican food in Montreal, as I do not find it commonly fresh. I got the East-Meets-West Sesame Tuna & Parmesan Halibut with bok choy and asparagus risotto. My friends got the Seared Diver Scallops, apricot & goat cheese risotto \""baklava\"" and lamb chops. The bartender warned my friend that her plate would be hot but her baklava was luke warm. My fish came smelling like fish and the bok choy was so immersed in soy that there was no little room for any other flavor. \n\nFinally we ordered the tiramisu cheesecake. One word. Costco. It felt like something I could have purchased at Costco in bulk. Not that I mind Costco but this is Eddie's reputation I am consuming. Although the service was great the food was not, especially since Eddie was there and we were the only group there when we left. I would like to chalk it up to the curse that had befallen Cook and Jacks but I do not know..."
0,"I just purchased a CPO BMW here and can not be more displeased.  I am looking at all available ways to protect future buyers from the same dishonesty.  BEWARE:  Their Certified Pre-Owned vehicles are priced erroneously higher than the original MSRP and the MSRP of the new model year.  There  is nothing to substantiate the inflated price increase for their CPOs that is well above market value, retail value and MSRP; except to make you overpay for the vehicle you are looking to purchase and to make it seem like your \""negotiations\"" are leading to deliver a good purchase price...when reality, it is not.  Additionally, their discussions, when questioned, feel dishonest when questioning trim levels of BMWs.  Please make sure YOU are looking at the correct make and model of your vehicle...as their attempt at deception and engine sizes and models need to be researched by you.  Even the contract is deceiving as it can note your vehicle is a 2.8L, when in reality, it's a 2.0L.  Please save yourself money and shop for your vehicle at another location....or just take a couple of moments, look at their CPO prices, and see the inappropriate business practices for yourself."
3,"You can always find something interesting at Bookman's.  My family and I like to trade in old books for store credit and pick up new books.  They also have electronics, games, toys, puzzles, music instruments, etc.  \n\nIt is a great way to de-clutter your home!"
4,I have been going here like 3 years.  Lani is the best her pedicures always last forever and everyone always compliments my nails and pedicures.
1,"Wife and I went there for lunch around 2 PM. Ordered a beer and waited about 10 minutes. Thought they must be really busy, got up to look around, hardly anyone there. No one behind the bar. When food came the guy didn't bother to ask who order which plate, just put them down in front of us. Wrong plates. Fries were cold. Called waitress over and asked for hot fries and also the biscuits she never brought. She was very polite and took care of it. Must say, the meat was excellent. Baby Backs, burnt tips and chicken."
4,"Wir waren hier bereits 3 mal mit Freunden drin. Der Barkeeper hatte sich die Zeit genommen und sich zu uns gesetzt. Nach einem netten Plausch, habe ich mir einen Cocktail empfehlen lassen. Ich wei\u00df nicht mehr was alles drin war und auf der Karte war der Cocktail auch nicht  aber lecker war er.\nDas Ambiente ist wirklich angenehm und absolut nicht snobig oder spie\u00dfig. Es ist sehr leger. Man braucht nicht mit Hemd und Kragen kommen\nWir kommen definitiv wieder. Weiters so."
0,"Bill Johnson's Has Lost Its Giddyup and Should Just Go\n\nA friend and popped into Bill Johnson's for lunch unplanned. We should have planned better. \nNow looking for a lighter fare perhaps we shouldn't have tried a \""cowboy\"" establishment, but I was still craving some down home cooking after a disappointing trip to Chilleens on 17 (you can check out my review of them as well if you'd like), so we took a shot. \nService was friendly enough and they had Kiltlifter on tap; a redeeming grace for any establishment in my humble opinion. My friend tried a smothered chicken breast and I went for the saut\u00e9ed tilapia since I was wanting something a tad lighter. But I was still craving some good baked beans and a baked potato with the works sounds delicious. My friend went for the green beans and the interesting sounding green chile mac and cheese. \nThe food took a while to get there. So long that I was beginning to think the fish was a good choice since clearly they were having to still catch it and kill it. When it arrived I was far from impressed. The sides were lukewarm at best yet the fish was hot; telling me that things sat around waiting for the cook to prepare my fish. I now wish they had found somewhere else to go. \nWhile my friend's chicken wasn't bad with peppers and onions and cheese, the smothering was hiding a near inedible edge to the breast. Clearly cooked at too hit a temp and ruining the edges of the meat. My fish had received the same treatment. Add over spicing with pepper and some loathsome lemon butter goo, and you get a relatively unpleasant meal.  \nThe sides were no better. Bland canned baked beans once again and the \""cheese\"" sauce was as runny as water in the mac and cheese. \nThis review seems somewhat redundant after all the other bad reviews if this place, but now I know to check the Yelp before moseyin' into this corral."
0,"While the deep fried pickles were wonderful, a unique variation using kosher dill pickle spears instead of chips, the remainder of our meal was a regrettable failure. Our remarkably poor service, given the fact that our table was almost IN the kitchen, didn't improve with a comment to the manager. Our server was clearly incapable of handling a group of 15 people, and the manager did little to ease her burden. After drinks, over priced because Lucille's doesn't honor happy hour prices in the dining room, it took almost 45 minutes between asking to have our food order taken, and the waitress actually being ready to take our order."
4,Charles is AWESOME! My Chihuahua's Louie & Chloe LOVE it here & they LOVE Charles! (and they hate going ANYWHERE!) Thanks for being so amazing!
2,"Great beer selection.  But if you are looking for more consistency, it is probably not the spot (they have a rotating tap selection).  The food was actually quite wonderful. I didn't expect much for bar food, but was pleasantly surprised.  I went with a large group and we had a great time drinking and answering trivia questions from one of their board games (there is a whole table full of games for customers to enjoy, yay!). \n\nI'd say the biggest downfall for this place is the atmosphere and service... there was pretty full crowd when I went in-and only 1 server for the whole place.  Ridiculous.  He was real nice and apologetic so we took it all in stride.  But there were _long_ stretches where we didn't see him or get helped.  He did his best to keep up, but it was a noticeable problem. Sure I'd go back, but never again when hungry.  As for the atmosphere--the bar is a few steps up from a dive.  Okay to hang out for locals, but not the place to impress.  Friendly staff, good food and beer are enough to make you overlook this."
2,"Very impressive special effects, clever, imaginative and funny displays, nice staff, and not a lot of scientific content. It would be a great place for a kid, or someone who just likes special effects (a 3-D movie, a room with a shaking floor that simulates earthquakes, a dome theater), but the science is painted with a rather broad brush. As an example, and as an earlier reviewer pointed out, the explanation of how we figured out that the Earth isn't the center of the universe completely leaves out Copernicus, and suggests that it was Galileo's invention of the telescope that provided the aha! moment. And why do movie-makers have to accompany explosions in airless space (in this case, the Big Bang) with loud booming noises? And for that matter, the Big Bang wasn't an explosion in space; it was the very creation of space, so they got that part wrong, too. And it would have been so much more interesting if they had gotten that sort of thing right, because astronomy and earth science and biology can all be fascinating. But would I bring the kiddies here? Absolutely."
1,"Ya, OK, it is a adult toy store right.. Sometimes I want to go look at things I might buy on Amazon.. Seriously. This store is a bit over priced, they all are in my opinion, anywho.. I just want to snoop around in stores like this, I have no interest in chatting it up with the sales staff. SERIOUSLY, if I need your help I will ask. \n\nSo I walk in and the sales staff says hi, I say hi and move on in.. now she is following me..\""Is there anything I can help you find?\"" Nope, I'm good... She is still on me, \""Well we have x and y and this and that\"" Uh, ya thanks I'm good.. SERIOUSLY? I have a rough idea of whats in here, leave me alone sheeesh!\n\nThe sales staff is inappropriate and nosy, unless you like to feel like you have stepped onto a used car lot from the 1980's... come on people a bit of decorum! UUGGHHH.. Will not be back..\n\nHowever, if you have zero idea of what to do with the things you find in here, I am pretty sure the sales staff could give you detailed instructions ANNOYING.."
0,Waited forever in drive thru to finally get my order that was wrong. I could here the employees inside complaining about the lines and really didn't want to be at work. Once home the sides were cold and coleslaw tasted spoiled. Will NOT return
4,"Celebrated my 40th birthday here with my family!  A special dinner during a special weekend.  Not only do I think Lawry's has the best Prime Rib I've ever had but I think the way the restaurant is ran, it's one of the best overall restaurant experiences.  The Prime Rib sits in a cart that is brought to your table and sliced individually.  The waitress was extremely polite and impressive.  I can't afford to eat here often but I do believe treating yourself every once in a while is required.  Make reservations early.  We didn't get to go the night we initially wanted due to the popularity."
0,"So I'm waiting in line to order take out and watch the 2nd round of the NFL playoffs, and the hostess informs me I have to be seated to order take out. Really? Fail!\n\nI'd like to give no stars if yelp allowed!"
2,"This is one of those Casinos that I had passed by on my last four trips to Vegas, but never went in. This time I went in on a buzzed whim, it seemed fairly well themed, though falling apart just like Disneyland. Unlike at NY NY, they actually have the tables *on* the street...not on carpet. I felt this was a nice touch, though it seemed not to help my luck at all. I can't say that I enjoyed the vibe here, but its worth a look. The cocktail waitress' here came off as creepy."
2,"This definitely isn't the best buffet in Vegas, but it will do in a pinch. I paid extra for unlimited alcohol (champagne), and was a little surprised when it arrived at my table served in a plastic water cup. Oh, well...it's all going down the same way, anyway! I don't know that I'd necessarily visit this buffet again (as Rachel S. noted, the interior is pretty drab and is reminiscent of a hospital cafeteria).  The food wasn't much better than what you would get at a Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral.  BUT...bonus points to our waitress; she was super sweet and before she got off her shift, she snuck over and left me with an entire BOTTLE of my own champagne. What a doll!"
1,"I bought a cheap car wash and I got what I paid for.  I work near another automatic car wash with a similar set-up, but since I was off today and not in the area, I needed for find a different place.  I guess I got what I paid for (?), but I wouldn't return.  I paid the automated machine, and a guy slowly walked up to the spot where I'd put my wheel into place as if I was taking time out of his day.  They actually do a quick manual wash before you enter, and manually \""dry\"" your car (I say that loosly) when you exit, but I still had bird stains on my car and a couple of dirt speckles.  Unfortunately, it was just a lousy job/experience.  I gave two stars just because they do the quick manual wash and dry, albeit, haphazardly."
2,"Oh infamous Waffle House, ubiquitous breakfast place of the south for many a hungover/still drunk patron.\n\nAs far as Waffle Houses go this one was pretty clean and friendly. Food here tastes the same as any other Waffle House I would say mediocre. But you know what? It all tastes so good when you're hungover from a crazy night. Granted I felt a bit sick afterwards from eating so much fatty processed food but we all have to make sacrifices when we are trying to eat and have only found $7 around the house right?\n\nService is friendly, being really close to where I had passed out the night before, cleanliness, and massive amounts of cheap food make this Waffle House a winner in my book. Really what more can you ask for?"
3,Very enjoyable atmosphere and staff. Had the ribs with very good sauce while not swamped on it. Great taste and seasoning. Beans and rice where pretty decent will go back in the future. The muay Thais are great with just the right combination
0,I was not impressed. Food quality was low and tasted cheap. I have no idea why ppl rave about it. I won't go back. Liberty is across the parking lot and a thousand times better plus they use local food.
0,"Terrible. Sergios installed sod at my house and didn't bring a roller. The \""crew\"" didn't even know what one was. When I called the office they told me another crew would come later in the day to roll it. I went ahead and paid. Big mistake. They never came back. The job came out terribly.  When I tried to follow up they ignore my messages. I recommend going with someone who's more honest and reputable."
1,"Went here with my dad and cousin. We waited 30 minutes outside. I thought to myself, \""heck yeah, this wait is going to be worth it because I've heard a lot of good things about this place!\"" Tried the food. Wasn't impressed. I ordered a Shoyu Ramen and a mini mentaiko bowl. I expected the mentaiko bowl to be delicious, and it was--but trust me, after a few bites that sodium content will turn you off. A few minutes later, the shoyu ramen came. Too salty for my tastes. \nMy cousin ordered a Tonkotsu ramen and I tried it. I wish I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen instead because it wasn't AS salty, but still pretty salty. My dad ordered a miso ramen. Again, it was salty.\n You get the gist.\n\nAside from the salty dishes, we ordered gyoza and fried rice. The fried rice was pretty standard and the gyoza was just a bit better from the frozen ones you can get at the store. Neato.\nMaybe I'll come back when I'm low on sodium intake. \n\nThe only good thing was the service. I wouldn't recommend this for big groups because the place is pretty small and it's usually packed whenever I'm around the area."
3,"We decided to try this vegetarian Chinese restaurant that opened this past April for lunch immediately prior to flying home.  We parked behind the restaurant on the 2nd level of the plaza and entered through the rear door.  The restaurant is bright, meticulously clean and tastefully decorated.  We were immediately greeted at the door and seated by Mimi who was incredibly cheerful and informative as were both chef/owner Kenny and another server who I believe may have been his wife.  The meal started with complimentary cups of soup - a clear broth with a few vegetables and tofu.  For entrees, we shared the crispy spicy eggplant and spicy crispy beef. Both were delicious, but the \""beef\"" dish, made from tofu, was interesting due to its crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, texture and flavor."
4,"SO GOOD.  Large menu of \""regular\"" hotdogs, specialty dogs (Angry Kimchi Dog!!), and rice bowls.  My Angry Kimchi Dog was fantastic and had generous amounts of bulgogi and kimchi sitting on top of the actual hotdog.  Party in my mouth.  \n\nFun atmosphere and helpful staff = enjoyable dining experience.  Everything on the menu is under $5.  Portions are generous but everything is so yummy that it's not hard to eat everything yourself.  :)"
2,"First time here for me and my Taiwanese wife. The food was good. We shared 3-cup chicken, cold beef tendon w/ chili sauce, beef pies and stinky tofu. OK, she ate the stinky tofu. I tasted it once in Taiwan and that was enough for me. I have no complaints with the food although I am fairly sure that the 3-cup chicken was heated (or reheated) in a microwave. The sauce was really good, but like traditional Taiwanese cooking, the chicken was cut up into small pieces with bones in. I know that conveys \""authentic\"" to some, but I don't want to have to work that hard and get my hands all messy with sauce to eat. Boneless chicken would just make this dish spectacular in my opinion. The service was typically efficient and not overly friendly and/or chatty. Food was relatively quick to come out and my wife did enjoy it as traditional Taiwanese. One other thing, and fairly common in Asian restaurants was the thermostat was reading 80-81 degrees. I don't want to sweat while I eat either. If we happen to be close by, we might return, but I don't think we would make a special trip to eat here again."
3,"Not gonna lie, I don't dream about dining in veg-only restaurants often, or ever, but with a lunch date with my vegetarian sister on the books, I figured it was a good enough reason to try the place... I have to say I was very impressed.\n\nWe chose to sit outside and it was quite nice. The handful of iron chairs and wood-top tables scattered on wooden flooring made you forget you were yards from central avenue, until a train would come through. Lots of plant life, and they had a few heaters set up. We opted for the cucumber infused water (there were other bottled options) and started on the menu. We were give one which was simply drinks, the front half is freshly made juices and juice blends (all $6 - we opted for a lemonade/agave concoction) the back is beers and wines. \n\nThe food menu is the perfect length - just enough small plates, sandwiches, salads and entrees, with lots of daily changes (bruschetta, soup of the day, buddha bowl, cheese selections). They also have the items which are vegan or can be made vegan marked with little ferns, which I thought was clever. We couldn't pick, so we decided to split four of the small plates (but the table next to us had the OM burger and it looked amazing).\n\nSquash blossom hush puppies - yummm. thank you kenny r. for the heads up. I wouldn't have known it was vegan cheese if it hadn't said so on the menu. So good, I didn't want to share. I enjoyed the onion \""butter\"", my sister did not, luckily these pups stand perfectly well on their own.\n\nThe Indian Tacos - this, as a meat lover, was hands down my favorite dish. If I hadn't know any better I would have sworn up and down with the complex flavors they brought into the chili that I was eating something heartier than beans and squash. Mixed in with the lettuce and tomato and then sandwiched between a layer of the sharp cheddar on top and fried goodness underneath, holy crap, I'm sold. \n\nThe Envious Artichoke is the perfect light dish, stuffed with spinach and olives and topped with fried onions- we were very happy campers. On the other hand, the cannelloni added some serious weight to my stomach. Granted, it's a great fall flavor concoction of goat cheese goodness served over a sweet squash puree - but not the greatest choice for our fourth tasting dish. \n\nOur service was top notch- water constantly filled, staff was very familiar with the menu, we were checked on just the right amount of times. Even though there isn't any meat on your menu, Fern, I'm a fan. (but seriously, get some new pens.)"
0,"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!\n\nFrom the moment I spoke about getting a car wash to the moment I left, I regretted being there. Terrible customer service, I don't mind emotionless service but don't be rude to me, I don't need your service, plenty of other car washes I can take it to. Which I will be because I will never return nor recommend. Whole demeanor changes once they realize you don't want their 'detail' or 'windshield replacement', even the cashier is downright terrible. Luckily, I had a bunch of free coupons for the wash they've been putting in parking lots, cause the quality is about the same as a $5 automated car wash and not worth the hassle.\n\nNEVER AGAIN!"
2,"Room: Everything was clean and we enjoyed using the flat screen t.v. while getting ready but there was a white/creamy-ish stain on the runner of one of the beds...I really don't want a reminder that I'm sleeping in a bed that several others have slept in (or did more than just sleep in).  But all in all, very comfortable room - MUCH better than Harrah's or Imperial Palace (but those hotels aren't on the same scale as Paris in terms of cost either).  \n\nRestaurants:  The food here is really not very good.  We ate at Le Cafe and tried to eat at Le Village Buffet but the line was too ridiculously long so we settled for a crepe stand instead.  Everything was just very mediocre.  Nothing was amazing, it just did the job of satisfying my hunger.  \n\nCasino:  The casino area is very small and I lost money there so I will associate negative feelings with that area.  But to be fair I only bet and lost $20 (big spender...) and I did have fun the entire 20 minutes I was playing roulette.  \n\nI would stay here again...but if I could afford Encore I would not give this place a second look.  Au Revoir Paris."
4,"Good deal on color printing here. They charge by the amount of coverage on the page, so color prints can be less expensive if there is a lot of white space in your document.  Quick turnaround and personal service. Definitely worth using and a local small business as well."
4,"This food will blow your mind!  The restaurant is small but it's so worth the wait.  We tried basically everything because it was just one great dish after another, we had spicy pork bulgogi, leek pancake, stir fry rice noodles with beef, kimchi fries rice and dumplings...all fabulous!  The owners are the chef and wait staff and are very friendly, they make the visit extra special."
0,"The meat here tastes nasty-so nasty I had to send it back.  I tried a curry chicken dish and the beef with eggplant.  The curry was good if it was without the chicken. When I sent it back the lady got so mad and started yelling in her language =/  I felt so weird.  What horrible customer service!  And then she said to me, \""that is the last eggplant today-NO MORE.\"" I was like oooookaaayyy whatever that meant lol  I would never ever come back.  The restaurant looks dirty and there is no health grade rating posted anywhere (and we all know why).  I wonder what they are trying to hide.  Anyways, do yourself a favor and go to Thai Chili."
2,"This was the last buffet my boyfriend and I came to on our BOB adventure. We had just eaten at the Rio and came to Lago really for desserts.\n\nBut of course, when we got there, we decided to eat some regular foods. This buffet was definitely the smallest of the three we went to. Actually, I think this buffet is smaller than Hometown Buffet. \n\nAnyways, I ate some bread...after doing some searching for butter. I know, it sounds minimal, but I really wanted bread and butter...but the butter is not with the bread? It's over by the salad part station, weird. Anyways, I got my bread and butter. I also got some ribs, but I was SO full that I think I only ate one. It tasted good, but I was so full that I really didn't want to eat anymore. \n\nI all the food settle though before going over to the desserts. At first, I didn't see the desserts and was like \""WTF\""?!?! But then realized that it was in the middle of the restaurant. I agree, the desserts are the best here! \n\nService was a little slow on refilling drinks. He'd take our plates, but wouldn't ask if we wanted a refill, when we obviously had no more soda left. And the lady that was working as the cashier was super slow. I'm glad we had a lot of time to spare because I would have been sad if we didn't make it into this last one because the lady was ringing so slowly. \n\nDue to the small selection, I wouldn't come here on it's own. There's not enough to feel like I'd get my money's worth here. But if you're doing the BOB, coming here for the desserts is good enough!"
2,"Unfortunately, I didn't get my FIX.\n\nI am in the middle for this place. The service was great, they were very hospitable and just attentive without being intrusive. To conduct such service in an environment, where everyone is either drunk or not from there ... is impressive. I wouldn't recommend this place for big groups. When my friend had made the reservation for us, and they said the limit was 5 -- that seemed to make sense. The environment is intimate, cozy and there is a lot of noise.\n\nThe place itself is nice, I love the decor... it's warm woods, make it sexy and the way that it opens up into the hotel is nice. It doesn't close you off from the hustle and bustle that is the Bellagio... and ultimately, that is Vegas.\n\nWhere I run into trouble is the actual menu itself. It's kind of boring. The food, I feel is art here. But more like paint running down a wall. I was uninspired and slightly sober... so I still hold true to that. And that is the point of Vegas, if you eat more than you drink... something is to be said. So ultimately, you don't get your fix.\n\nThere was a wide array at the table. Lobster tacos were $22, and came into very small finger size tacos served on a metal rack. Pizza was tapas size which ran $18. Kobe Sliders with Fries runs $25. Filet runs $50 with no sides. For myself, I ordered like an anorexic -- because I had just swallowed a buffet earlier in the day. I did the Fried Mac n' Cheese which was delectable and the Cucumber Essence martini was great. Total of that $24. And in true Vegas fashion, somehow $60 escaped me at this place.\n\nAll in all, I might come back. If I can let go of my inner fat girl and not surrender to my natural gluttony. Because, when I sit down to eat... I don't expect to feel helpless looking at the food coming out... I expect to feel slightly satisfied."
2,"I came here with my boss, was told that they sell pasta to the Strip. The decor is lovely, and the owner nice, and the service prompt. The food was only mediocre, though. My husband had the ravioli, and I had black ink shrimp pasta. My dish had a lot of butter, and the pasta not as fragrant as what I had at other restaurants. My dish was $26 just for the entree with a small salad."
4,"Recently rented speakers and microphones for an event and was very pleased with the service and quality. I emailed Full Compass, described my needs, and received a prompt response with a quote (within a couple hours). \n\nEasy pick up during regular business hours. I was showed how to use the equipment and it was loaded into my car. Equipment was easy to set up during our event and the sound quality was great! Quick and simple return. Will definitely use them again!"
0,"The highlight of our visit here has to be the lengthy typed 'banned list' on the wall. \n\nThere is so much to say about this place, so let me start with the positives...\n- The characters inside seem lovely, this is clearly their second home but they have such a lovely sense of community with they darts and dominoes club.\n- When Joe and I walked in we didn't feel unwelcome despite the fact that we stuck out like a saw thumb.\n- The drinks are unbelievably cheap, \u00a31.70 for a vodka lime and soda.\n- Although we didn't try any, they had a small food menu, rolls for 90p and a burger for about \u00a31.70.\n\nHowever, there are many negatives...\n- It was close to 100\u00b0c inside.\n- Smelled like an old people's home.\n- Generally a bit manky.\n- It was like an old men's social club, not somewhere a 26 year old female really fits in!\n\nSo overall, if you are an old man who wants to sit in the pub all day with some friends, then this is the place for you!"
4,"Herbs and Spices OH MY!!!\n\nEvery Spice, Herb, baking ingredient you can imagine is here and the quality is just superb! I will never waste my money at any other place on spices or herbs...because unless they are Penzey's they are a waste of money!\n\nI personally love there Cumin, their extracts, Vanilla and Almond, and their many Cinnamon Choices, are the most amazing quality and are worth every penny. \n\nI look forward to every visit to the store so I can try a new item each time I go. I keep a list in my spice cabinet to make sure I never run out and so I never have to rush off to the grocery store for a spice while cooking...God forbid I run out of my Penzey's Spices!!"
1,"Want some Sage advice? Go somewhere else.  There are dozens and dozens of better restaurants in Las Vegas. I am clueless here. I really, really don't understand why the ratings for this place are so high.\n\nThis is the kind of restaurant where the presentation is everything. Where presentation is more important than the taste. I've never seen food look so pretty.  Every dish looks like it is ready for a photo shoot. Unfortunately, every dish didn't taste very good. Just bland. But hey, if you like your food to look as pretty as the people around you this is the place to go."
0,I specified no sauce on stir fry vegetables they were sopping.  I specified with a call back after order extra hot mustard no mustard in delivery the soggy vegetables were swimming in the plastic take out bag I called the owner he couldn't have cared less hate this place!!!
3,"Delicious!  Fresh baked goodies everyday!  Menu concept reminds me of Hash House A go-go but healthier!  Also, you pay cashier and pick up your drinks, then find a table.  Kind of weird service set up.  But food is worth the wait!  Can't wait to go back for lunch salads, i'll be back for sure!"
1,"This place has so much potential, but unfortunately their customer service is very poor and I don't care to ever go there again. I went on a Thursday night because I was selected to have a VIP Party there.  The lady at the door must not have been trained properly because I had to ask her where we were supposed to sit and even when we decided on the table there was no waitress to be found for at least 10 minutes. \n\nFree appetizers came with the VIP Party and I understand it's \""while supplies last\"" but why would you set out big plates AND little appetizer plates. By the time my party got in line to get their food we were left with the little plates and they ran out of chicken wings. \n\nWhile bowling was fun, my friends and I were waiting yet again for a server to come and give us menus. As soon as the server came to our table I asked her the prices of the martinis and if she had a favorite. Her answer basically left me wanting just a water because she didn't have a favorite martini and didn't care to refer anything else. My friend ordered a couple martinis. She didn't like them even though she was already tipsy and it took over 15 minutes for the bartender to make them. \n\nAs if the service for the food and drinks weren't bad enough, the lady at the front desk handling the bowling lanes was pretty rude as well. I wanted to split the lane up between 5 people and the amount was about $13 she says, \""Really??? $13? You want to split it?\"" After waiting five minutes for her to split the ticket I ended up just paying for it altogether. \n\nIt really sucked because I love to bowl and this would've been a great spot for me and my friends to come out to on occasion. However, I'll settle for Dave and Busters or even AMF next time."
0,This place is horrible. Not only was I promised front line access but free drinks until 1am. They did not live up to any of it. I understand some things are out of peoples control but even the service was horrible. I am spending $15 a drink and they can't even say a thank you.
3,"I went with a few friends and we split a few dishes, so I got to try a good amount of stuff.  Here goes:\n\nbeef shawarma - Very, very good.  Only about $4, so it was tasty and well priced.\n\nflafel sandwich - Also good.  Falafel is incredibly hard to make well, and there's is pretty damn good.  Not the best I've ever had (that was at a street market in Amsterdam), but it was still much better than most.\n\nbaba ganoush - like falafel, this is also very difficult to get right.  Any idiot can make a decent hummus, but baba is tough.  Theirs has excellent flavor, but it was served too cold.  I like it to be a bit chilled, slightly below room temp, but this was straight-up cold.  I don't know if they always do it this way, but this was my experience.\n\nmeat pie - this was okay, nothing too special.  It was pretty cheap, so I guess I can't complain too much.  \n\nOh, the garlic sauce was frickin' amazing.  An absolute must have!\n\nother notes:  since it's a market, you're better off buying your drink in the market side.  1 bottle of water from the cooler next to the food register was $1.50, but a package of 24 bottles of water from the market was ~$5.  You decide."
3,Best steak in Vegas!
2,If you pay the $7 24 hour pass and plan to go down up and down The Strip for that long then The Deuce is the way to go! It is easy to spot The Deuce because it is a gold double decker bus. Often times the bus is jammed packed and at one stop they had to turn passengers away because they were too full. Probably a common occurrence for the bus drivers to do when driving The Strip. Despite those inconveniences walking or taking The Deuce is really the best way to get around on The Strip because driving is a real pain in the ass and it doesn't help when there are loads of inconsiderate Nevada drivers on the roads as well as tourists who are driving and don't haven a clue to what they are doing! That doesn't stop from taxi drivers from beeping at you with their horns when you are in a crosswalk and in their way though!
4,"The kobe beef burger melts in your mouth and is reasonably priced at $21. You MUST try it!  The filet mignon sandwich and french dip were also amazing!  The buns are made in house daily and you can taste the difference.  Although some reviewers say this is not a good place for kids, our teenagers felt welcome and there were TVs everywhere which offered visual distractions for all ages.  Our server, Jose, was attentive and no one blinked an eye when one of our kids spilled her drink TWICE.  We will definitely visit again!"
1,"I came with high expectations to this place of of a recommendation and was really not impressed. I came in after the dinner rush to place a take out order. The staff was pretty friendly but they didn't seem all that excited to be at their job. As for the location, there is both indoor and outdoor  seating which is nice. \n\nI got two veggie sandwiches to go for my vegan sister and I. As a vegan in-training, I made sure to ask for dressing on the side and no cheese and came home to find both on the side salads. I also found a hair in my salad which was a bit unappetizing. The sandwich itself was alright... a little soggy but pretty tasty. \n\nI think I will come back and give it another try if I am in the area."
0,i got band from goretorium face book page for a bad review i gave about what a rip off it is and only a handful of actors left since openning. \nnot worth the 30+ dollars and at 15.00 a drink (very small) i wouldn't recomend this venue to anyone who is into horror/terror.\ni would be interested in buying some of the props when they close.
4,"This is the best place in the east valley to find vintage and antique items. With over 140 occupied booths, you'll find nice variety here. There are \""man\"" themed booths, Victorian frills and lace, western flavored booths and lots of cool vintage kitchen ware. All kinds of win here!"
2,"Came here for a late lunch and was pretty disappointed by the service.  Our waiter took our order promptly enough and we received our food.  The sandwich I ordered was on the wrong bread and I spent what seemed like forever waiting for the waiter to come back around.  In the meantime I discovered that there was also a hair in the sandwich.  I eventually managed to flag him down and asked about the bread.  He took it back to the kitchen and when he came back, told me that they were out of the bread I ordered.  Ok...so why didn't someone come out and ask me what I wanted instead, rather than just making it with something else and hoping I wouldn't notice?  Seems pretty straightforward.  I got a new sandwich and by that time my boyfriend was almost done eating.\n\nAfter that, our waiter never bothered even stopping by our table again to check in, other than walking by to drop off the check.\n\nSandwich was good (...the second one, sans hair) although the \""special sauce\"" appeared to just be a mustard...maybe they were out of that too."
4,"I hope you enjoy this restaurant as much as I did!\n\nI've had Mexican Food in the best restaurants in Mexico City, & hands down Padre's lives up to it's reputation of being one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. The food is spicy but not so hot that you have to drink gallons of libations just to put the fire out... Although every one boasts about their Margaritas, I tried out the Sangria, it was so good that I had ordered a second...\n\nI will definitely go back!"
3,"I really liked staying at this hotel. We had an excellent room. It is very classy and chill compared to the other Vegas casinos. Clean, quiet, modern - like a boutique hotel on steroids. I would prefer to be even more central on the Strip (e.g. Caesar's). Late night we spent too much time at the Luxor - b/c that was our only walkable choice (other than Excaliber)."
3,"This place is great the largest outdoor swapmeet around. They have tons of crap but they have the dancing monkey lots of pets and of course just seeing the people is pure entertainment. They also have BBQ-some of the best meat on a stick around and of course awesome BBQ chicken. At this place if you ask around you can find anything you want. AND if you wanna sell something just show up at 4-5 am on FRI,SAT,SUN and you just pay $30-$35 to have a spot, they are marked off inside the swapmeet. Set up your table or whatever and sell all day long, they still use the honor system to pay your taxes when you leave. Cost $1 to get in."
4,"Platinum Blonde Perfection.  Jay works wonders and he has given me the best platinum blonde 'do ever.  It was gorgeous.  My hair looked like corn silk.  If I had boat-loads of money, I'd fly him out to LA every 6 weeks for a touch up.   Go to see Jay...tell him Laura from LA sent you."
4,"LOVE this place!\n\nService=5 star\nDecor=5 star\nFood=5 star\n\nSuch a hidden gem in the southwest valley. If you enjoy fresh Japanese food done right, do yourself a favor and check this place out. It's phenomenal."
3,"I really like this beauty supply store, it's just so far from where I live.  So when I do get to that side of town, I  usually stop in because I know they have something I need or haven't seen, or need to get."
2,"After waiting in line & finally getting in the crowded venue, it wasn't long until one of my friends realized that she had misplaced her wallet near the bar.  (no bueno).  I don't think we ever got to enjoy dancing on every floor.  The decor is nice I suppose... statues & red lights... flower petals floating in water... candlelight.  I wasn't ready to leave the nightclub that night.  I felt like it could have offered so much more.  Till next time I guess...   I feel like there are other clubs nowadays I would much rather go to - if you're basing it off of who is performing that night."
3,"Panera is my \""go-to\"" lunch spot.\n\nNo matter what I'm craving, sweets, bagels, smoothies, sandwiches, salad or soup it's here....perfect!!\n\nI'm a total fan of  the \""You Pick 2\"". I almost always get it when I visit and I leave full and happy. And how awesome is it that you can add a bakery treat for $.99...whoo hoo!\n\nSo I was here a little after 2pm, there were a few people ahead of me but it didn't bother me since it gave me time to drool over the desserts, muffins, scones and cookies. \n\nMy cashier was awesome, very funny and perky. She was a great employee to have and excellent customer service. \n\nI decided to keep in simple today, nothing new just one of my usuals the Sierra turkey sandwich which has turkey breast, chipotle mayonnaise, field greens, red onions on asiago Cheese Focaccia and the Greek salad which has Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, feta cheese, peperoncini, red onions, olives, pepper and Greek dressing.\n\nThe asiago cheese focaccia is heavely...I would eat this bread all day if I could...it's so freaking good. But I digress, the sandwich was great, I love the chipotle mayo mixed with the field greens and focaccia...such a great combination of flavors. The salad was delicious too, I'm really like the combination of the feta cheese, dressing and peperoncini and that crisp romaine lettuce....Mmmmm \n\nFor dessert I picked the cinnamon roll...O M G....even though I was stuffed, I actually managed to have one bite after my lunch and it was yummy! I'm saving the rest for tomorrow morning with a cup of coffee...Mmmm I can't wait! \n\nI'm just such a huge fan of this place, I love the food and the combinations of flavors. I mean really, what is there not to love about Panera???\n\nSeriously, delicious food...good service at this place. Will definitely go back!"
3,Really good food and one of if not the best selection of beer between here and the next closest Yard House.  The Happy Hour prices are even better.
1,"Not a great experience. My husband and I stopped in to Sprecher's for a sort of post-Memorial Day/back to work after a long weekend treat. The wait staff is friendly but I think we were very rushed. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms to start - Chef \""Mic\"" (as in Microwave) did not get all of them as hot as they should have been. I wondered in what freezer lane of Costco they were found. Also, our server forgot to bring the little plates - not a huge glitch but I wondered what else would go not-so-right.\n\nWell, that was dinner. Decided on the spur of the moment to get comfort food - meatloaf, mashed potatoes and \""creamed corn.\"" The corn actually was whole kernel with some semblence of cream sauce, which was ok-tasting but not hoopla. I am not sure what flavor was in the potatoes, that were under the two thinnish slices of meatloaf. I could tell by the \""stiffness\"" on top of the slices that the meatloaf - perhaps the entire plate - had been sitting a long time and zapped for heat. yarny breaded onion whatever-they-were didn't do anything to cover that up.\n\nWe sat on the patio, which we normally like there, but were seated just under a speaker at the edge of the gazebo that covers the bar. I'm not \""old\"" but can only take so much Z104 during dinner. \n\nOnce we were done, took forever to get our bill and a take-home box for the leftovers. Would have been an OK instead of really not-great experience if it hadn't been so expensive. Not such a treat. Has been better other times we've been there."
2,"Dined solo at this low-key sports-bar joint in the Palazzo.  The friendly bartender made up for the hostess' arrogance.  Fair wine selection, but limited menu options - especially if you are vegetarian.  The design is nice and it's fun to be able to watch the chefs preparing your food in what appears to be their very clean kitchen.  I had the burger and 3 bean salad with a nice glass of white wine, everything was tasty - but I wouldn't bother dining here again unless I happened to be hungry and standing outside."
1,"I'm pissed. How can you just stop making grilled cheese? Its bread and cheese. HOW? You have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?\n\nAlso, why does it have to be 400 degrees? I know you have A.C. This is AZ in the summer. It's hot. Turn it on.\n\nI don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because I rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst I have ever tasted. I had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.\n\nYour tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. At least you have that going for you."
1,"Very disappointed in the overall quality and flavor of the food.  A la carte entree items, such as the curries and samosas, seemed like they might be leftovers from that day's buffet or even the day before.  The naan bread was overly plain and half-burnt without the texture and flavor I get at other Indian food places.  The food looked \""ok\"" (sauces were oddly neon in color), but lacked character and the taste of each item was very one-dimensional.  We ordered all food \""mild\"" on heat (although we can handle spicy food just fine), but most members of my party still got an upset stomach later that night.  Wish I could recommend this authentic looking joint to friends and family, but I can't."
0,"We signed up our baby girl for the intro swim class towards the end of June.  She attended at least 2 swim classes without incident.  She enjoyed the classes and we even gave the instructor a gratuity. We missed swim class for the July 4th weekend and when we returned for the next week's class, some child made a bowel movement in the pool & class was cancelled - understandable.  This happened for the next 3 weeks (all classes we paid for and were promised we could make up).  Then, we paid for August's lessons on or about July 27, 2014. \n\nOnly after we paid for August lessons were we telephoned (on our about July 30, 2014)  & informed that our baby had been \""under suspicion\"" for making the bowel movements in the pool.  Mind you, our baby is exclusively breast fed & did not make solid bowel movements at all for those weeks.  Instructors who specialize in teaching infants should be somewhat familiar with the biological functions & physical development of infants.  When I spoke to the manager, Adam, about this, he seemed bewildered at the notion that an exclusively breast fed infant would not make a solid poop.\n\nSecond, we always dressed our baby in the approved, reusable swim diaper.  I have checked her diaper after each lesson and there has never been any trace of any bowel movement, nor are the elastics loose around her legs & waist.  Instead, the swim diaper is quit snug - so snug it leave indentations in her skin after class.  The only difference between the swim diaper we used and the School's swim diaper that they sell is that ours was white and theirs has a pattern.    \n\nThirdly, it was only after we paid for August lessons that we were informed that we were \""under suspicion\"" and informed that we were no longer welcome at the pool.   I understand the school has a no refund policy but we feel as though we were swindled - they took our money for August and then 3 days later told us we were not welcome!  Nevermind the fact that class was cancelled for 3 times in July & we never got a refund for those classes!  Why take our money for August classes and then 3 days later tell us that we are not welcome to return?  \n\nWe have spoken to management on at least 3 occasions just regarding the refund.  Last week, on approximately August 4, 2014, I was advised that we would get a refund for August.  The manager asked whether I wanted it picked up or mailed.  I asked them to mail it.  When we did not receive it as of Thursday, August 8, we called again and were told that the refund was mailed on Wednesday, August 7.  When it did not arrive as of Monday, August 11, we called again and were told \""no refunds\"".  Apparently, the school representative lied to us when she said it was mailed on Wednesday.  Now they say that they will see what they can do and have a manager call us. We may have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  \n\nThis place is not good for infants as they do not understand infant development."
4,"I feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon here but why not?\nI never take my kids here because I like to come here to avoid kids. You don't usually see children here, especially in the evening. Don't hate me - I have kids, I love kids, I just don't like being in a crowded movie theater with them.\nI came here recently to see Godzilla with a friend. I opted for the premium plus seating - for an extra $5 you get a lounge chair!  I like being able to order from a server who scoots around and whispers so others aren't bothered. \nOk, Ok, maybe I will bring my kids here sometime for a matinee if they promise to be really good. However, the risk is that they'll never want to go back to a regular theater."
4,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and took advantage of a special deal they had in the middle of summer.I have to admit that I felt pretty baller doing so, as 8 of my friends were sharing another suite while I dropped 3 bills to spend two nights here. Anyway, onward with the review.\n\nThe suites are very luxurious and I can't find much to complain about, other than the bathtub being slightly too small and the toilet area being a little bit creepy (it's very small and there's a mirror inside). The suite is divided into a living room portion and a bedroom portion, both of which are equipped with LCD TVs for your entertainment. The living room area has a huge couch, coffee table, and dining table for you and your guests to drink and chat over. In the interest of time, we had two of our meals there and amused ourselves by drinking bottled water out of fancy wine glasses. Classy. My only other complaint is that the overall layout of it is a bit nonsensical to me, as the bedroom is located closer to the entrance while the living room is in the back. \n\nThe service and staff are top-notch. I had two major issues during my stay here (neither of which are the hotel's fault) and they were quickly resolved. Issue #1: The suite they initially gave us smelled like weed. I called the front desk and they immediately moved me to a new room. Issue #2: Drunken woman mistakenly tries to enter my room at 4:00am. She bangs on the door when the key doesn't work and wakes me up. I call security and she is escorted back to her room down the hall. They are very professional and very respectful toward their patrons. I would recommend this place to anyone if they don't mind walking a bit to get to the hotspots on the strip.\n\n*update*\nAfter staying at a few other places and paying similar prices, I've decided to upgrade this place to 5-star based on the value. No reason why I should pay $100 per night for a hotel room when $50 more can get me a luxurious suite."
3,"Good, large burger (got Paris one)\nAvg. fries\nAwesome milkshake!\n\nGot $30 groupon and really enjoyed it!"
2,They have great sandwiches and 2 free egg rolls with a yelp check in? Yes please!\n\nMy only complaint is that the egg rolls were not up to par. They seemed to have a funny after taste and are not the typical Vietnamese egg rolls I'm used to eating.\n\nI have been to this restaurant twice. The food overall being good with good portion sizes. Prices are on par and very reasonable.\n\nThe service was good but I did have to wait a bit for more water.
1,"my children have been patients for 20 years but, sadly, things have changed. Customer service is less a focus...my  daughter had her first bladder infection and I tried to get her in...nurse never called back, when I went to the office to get help they wouldn t let me leave a specimen and told me she d have to wait for the next morning for an appt..then when I called for office manager to discuss my frustration she never called back either....Disturbing! I will be picking up my records and changing doctors..."
3,"I arrived at the Breakfast Joynt on the earlier side today to set up for the Elite Event... and since they were still open and I had a couple of hours to kill, I decided it was time to treat my toes to a little pedicure action!\n\nMinus one star for having to wait about 15 minutes (after i called to make an appointment).  It was worth the wait though...\n\nFirst of all, the salon is extremely clean.  You gotta like that!  Tammy did my pedicure and the guy who took my appointment, Shawn, brought me a bottle of water during the heavenly experience.  I went with the 'basic' spa pedicure.  It was $25 before tip.  It included the basics plus a wonderful massage and they even used a hot rag and hot stone after the regular massage!  Polish selection and application were not perfect, but then again, neither are my toenails!\n\nAs I was leaving, Shawn gave me some coupons , so I may just have to return for a manicure next time!  One tip - they take credit cards but you must tip in cash, so make sure to bring some dollar bills with you!"
2,"This was my first time here and I really wanted to know if this place lived up to the hype. We all know Gordon and how he acts on his show, so you'd think this place would be just flat out amazing.\n\nMy order:\nDamnation chicken burger\nTruffle Parmesan Fries\nCorona\n\nPresentation of the food looks great. I think more went into that than the taste. Nothing about this Chicken BurGR stood out except it was over grilled. I was not impressed by this at all.\n\nThe fries were nothing special either. They seemed to be normal steak fries with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on them. The truffles were in one of the dipping sauces. Again just didn't live up to the hype. \n\nThe Corona was probably the only thing that came out meeting my expectation. I placed the order on the iPad that was given to me and it didn't even get sent to the bar. The waiter came over and just took it and read it. My thoughts are it works if you want customized cocktails, but not for beers. I thought for sure it would be like STACKED (customized burger place in Los Angeles).\n \nOverall not that wowed by this place and it was a bit over priced. Aside from watching a game on the screens, and grabbing a drink or two, I would skip this place and probably any other GR place."
0,"Won't be back! Went there for Breakfast and the place was only half full, and a zero wait on a Saturday Morning...You think we would be ecstatic right? NOT! Everything was downhill from this point. I noticed they were using wait staff to seat people and check people out, this is fine for a small mom & pop, but not for large chain restaurant. Where was the hostess and manager...no where to be seen, that's where. This should have been our first sign. After being seated, it took 10 minutes before they took our drink order. I had to ask twice for a spoon for my coffee. Probably the worst cup of coffee I have ever had. After placing our order, we waited 30 minutes, then decided to walk after noticing our food sitting under the heat lamp for god knows how long (while our so-called waiter was checking people out). Be warned...stay away."
3,"Decor - 5 star\nGel Nail Polish selection - 5 star\nGlitter & Nail Art:  - 5 star\nPrice - 3 star\nOverall Nail Experience: 3 Star\n\nPros: Great nail color, art & glitter selections, atmosphere & salon are chic and stylish\nCons: touch overpriced as they charge you for every little extra where many of those are included elsewhere. Nail polish didn't stay on full 2 weeks; chipped after about a week. \n\nWill still come back but won't expect 5 stars."
2,"This place deserves 3.5 stars.  They do a lot more adventurous things than most buffets would, and they deserve credit for it. I mean, how many buffets have bone marrow or cow tongue as even an option as a star dish?  The standard buffet fare was slightly disappointing, with the Asian and pizza options being underwhelming.  Don't discount this as a negative review, as far as a buffet goes this place is totally legit.  I will be back."
2,"This isn't your stereotypical dirty Chinese buffet place, that being said it was expensive (duh its in Scottsdale). The food was pretty good for a buffett with tons of crab legs, sushi, desserts, salad, and chinese food options. The buffett was huge and the place was elegant looking for a buffett. I've been to other chinese/japanese restaurants that I've liked better for less money. I would go there again, but only for a special occasion b/c it's expensive."
2,"Very ehhhhh.  I mean I completely realize were not gonna get Orange County quality Thai food here, however, it doesn't give you an excuse to put it on there.\n\nPrime Example:\nBeef Pho - Come on...Seriously!  Whack and tasteless...then you go and charge $15 for it?!  You would do better with Top Ramen.  Actually they have that on the menu too.\nMee Goreng (haha) - You're nuts...and insulting for putting a $20 price tag on it.  With a couple pieces of meat.\n\nOkay it wasn't all bad:\nYellow Curry Chicken - Pretty solid and made it spicy the way I prefer it....Good job.\nTom Kha Chicken - Jesus this was spiceh!  But okay...chicken texture was good.\nYam poo Nim - Good starter.  Recommend to all.\n\nWe ordered other stuff but can't manage to finish this review.  I hate places that over charge based on vicinity.  I felt like I was eating a $12 tub of popcorn and a $6 Coke.  DUMB!"
4,"A very warm and welcoming feeling from the time you walk in till the time you leave   Mayo takes the time to really understand how you feel and does a great job making you feel much better when you leave  If you've been wanting to try Acupuncture, this is the place to go"
2,"P.F. Chang's is ... well, P.F. Chang's.  The plaster horse that's in front of every single chain signifies that you've entered the asian fusion place of champions.   The interior is like every other P.F. Chang's and the food also is.... same.\n\nThat in itself would probably rank itself in a 4 star category if you're not going down to Chinatown for the real thang.\n\nHowever, the one star deduction came from the terrible misplacement of their Curb-side service.  First, curb-side usually designates that someone will probably come out to take your order or what not.   Instead, this location decided to place the signage out behind their dumpster area.  And there's no video camera or anything so no one comes out to meet you or bring your food.  You still have to head over to the front entrance and get your food from the bar area.\n\nSecond, they blocked off the sidewalk with their outdoor patio gate.  So you'll walk the long way around to get to-go food.  It's not only an afterthought for curb-side service, it's a terrible location and there's not a dedicated area for it.  If you're going to do it, do it right.  I'd probably take pointers from Darden's (Outback/Carrabba's) who's had a pickup window/door for a while and they even re-implemented their areas in older venues.\n\nI would probably suggest that they re-do this with the parking that's facing the entrance to make this a more viable solution.  Picking up to-go food at the bar is so 1990s."
1,"I like Sams club alot. last few times i have been to this one, the employees all seemed pissed off at the world.  our cashier even threw our watermelon in to the cart. rude bunch at this location. our membership is up in 2 weeks. I think its time to try Costco. i heard they pay there people more than Sams Club. Maybe the workers have a better attitude."
4,"If you don't like Rock-n-Roll Fingers, I don't like you.  Period.  The owner rocked, he used to hook us up with an extra finger all the time!!  For all the shitty food in arizona I had to endure with, this place was a shining star!  Living back in New York, if I am ever cravin some chicken fingers, I know my hunger will not be succesully taken care of b/c their is no Rock-n-Roll substitute."
3,This is a decent Mexican restaurant with great staff and a relaxed environment. We had some wonderful beef enchiladas and a nice dining exerience.
0,"I'm not sure why this place has such rave reviews... I was here December 8th and I didn't even think to bother reviewing it until I saw the almost unbelievably high ratings. I went here with a group of 7 people and was very surprised at the poor service which seemed rushed and nearly annoyed at having to serve customers. Mind you we were the only people in this place... Drinks were not refilled until I had to walk me and a friends glasses up to the counter to ask for refills. Food was alright... For the price I was not impressed with freshness or taste. Plates were not cleared as courses came out and again our server, a middle aged man, seemed angry and as though he was trying to rush us. Lastly on my second trip to the counter to request refills on water, I saw the same server opening a mochi package from trader joes and cutting the pieces into fourths. Knowing my friends just ordered a four or five dollar desert I was overall dissapointed in nearly every aspect of miko's. Worst of all my fianc\u00e9 reported to me later that night that he had gotten sick from his sushi. :/"
2,The Vapery has all the basic element of a typical vape shop. They have a juice bar and a good selection of mechanical to your basic ecig. Some of their workers know there product and willing to teach you how work their product.\n\nI had to take 2 stars off because their juice isn't as good as what the market has to offer. I've been vaping for a while and got to try almost every vape juice west coast has to offer and The Vapery juices is lacking. If The Vapery owner is reading this then I just want to let you know your competition across the street. Their juice is very very identical to your juice with just a different name.\n\nI recommend just because the customer service is great and they are willing to sell individual accessories then the whole pack but they gotta work on their juice.
1,"I made an appointment for someone to take a look at my roof.  They were 15min late so I just left since this was for a rental.  They called me later and said I didn't need to be there, which was not what I was told by the person who set up the appointment in the first place.  \n\nSo this was on the 16th and sure its the holidays, but why does it take this long to drum up a bid?  So I sent a message through the website to which I didn't receive any response.  Then I called and an answering service took a message saying they were open that day and would call me back.  \n\nI've pretty much given up on this company at this point.  :/"
4,"I just found this place last week 12/31, 2014, the last day of 2014. I have to say, their crepe is the most delicious I have had. So so good!!! I also love their coffee! The service is good too. The waiter is friendly and cute! He gave me free small and cute desert and starter. ;-). You probably have to wait for a while to get your food. But I suggest you just laid back and enjoy the waiting and the atmosphere of the store."
2,"I went here for a Bank of America Luncheon that was buffet style. The food was really good. We had some chicken breasts with melted cheese on top......some tasty mashed potatoes, and some vegetable. For dessert we had some brownies that were kinda nasty. Looking forward to going at nighttime since people have said this is the \""hotspot\"" at night."
2,"It's 3 a.m. and you and your friends are hungry for poutine, a souvlaki pita wrap, a cheesecake slice, a pizza slice and coffee, but where, oh where do you go to get everything you want in one place? Angela's can answer that call and it is the place for all of your late-night, post-drinking needs. \n\nThis place is open 24 hours and is a decent go-to spot if your favourite late night eatery has a line-up. \n\nThe food isn't that great but at 3 a.m., who cares. It's satisfying, filling and cheap, which is what you're looking for."
4,"I was helping a friend buy a new Subaru Impreza back in December 2010.  I had done all my internet research (TrueCar, Edmunds, etc) to get my friend a good deal.  She also had a car she wanted to trade in; I researched that on the internet too.  Long story short...the saleman was very accommodating and patient (my friend brought both sisters to look at the car), we got the price we were looking for the car and the trade-in, and I think everyone was happy.  My friends still love the car.\n\nI gave a 5-star rating, because as heinous as it can be to buy a new car, this was truly \""as good as it gets.\""  One caveat, we were shopping for the car in late December, so I have a feeling that made them a lot more motivated to move cars."
2,Finally tried this deli for breakfast this morning. A bit hidden but anyplace that promises bialys (brooklyn bagels) and potato pancakes is worth a try in my book. Not a lot of people for sunday breakfast so we sat right away. Hubby had corned beef and thoroughly enjoyed it! I had an omelet with a bagel.. Gotta say i am a bagel afficionado and this is the best bagel i have had in charlotte! Would go back just for a bagel! If u like NY style delis... i.e. Pastrami and lox... Try it out! Coffee was good too!
1,"We used to enjoy this restaurant frequently.  Great lunch menu.  But sometime in the past few months the whole crew who worked there has been replaced.  We have had three disappointing meals.  Once, food cold.  Second, slow slow service and the owner (I guess) was flapping around loudly talking to workers.  When the dish came out with chicken instead of tofu and we returned it, there was quite a loud chorus of angst in the kitchen.  Today we ate there and again did not see a familiar face.  Again the wrong dish was brought out.  When you couple this with the loud music and (sometimes) TVs running it just became clear -- this isn't the restaurant for us anymore.  We'll be trying other Thai restaurants in the area."
1,So...Had a sudden craving for sushi for lunch...the only problem? I was at work and couldn't leave. So after doing much research on yelp I came across a few places that deliver and this was one of the first ones on the list...I'm less than 5 miles away from this place and I was just flat out refused service for delivery. I even offered to pay an extra delivery charge in addition to what they had. I also clearly stated that I had a big order but instead got a chuckle and a flat out no. I ended up calling Island sushi instead which is about the same radius as this joint and was greeted with friendly and helpful service. Oh and PS I'm located in Henderson just up Eastern from this place...save your time if you're in my area and call Island Sushi instead.
1,"I went to cheddars with my mother while I was in town visiting. She had up talked this place so much and convinced me to go. We went around 2pm on a Tuesday well after the lunch rush. We were sat pretty quickly. It took a while for our server to even take our drink orders. As we were sitting there I noticed multiple ants on the table. My mother nodded it off that they probably had just sprayed for bugs and came out. At this point I wasn't really feeling eating there. Out server finally came and took our drink orders, we already knew what we wanted because that's how long it took for her to come over. I ordered their loaded baked potato soup which was delicious and the monte cristo sandwich, also delicious. Low and behold I came down with a very unpleasant bout of food poisoning. I will not be going back during any of my future visits."
0,The worst apartment complex tied because of the management and the people here are sketchy and now there are gangs but across the street from Panda Express and down the street from the wealthiest place in Henderson but the worst cops in the nation because they are sketchy to
4,"I read the reviews and couldn't believe we hadn't tried The Deli with it being so close to home.\n\nThis place has it all. Great service and a new take on fresh local food plus a little cocktail lounge on the weekends when there is a long wait for a table.\n\nThe hummus with warm freshly made crackers is a must order. I ordered the half sandwich and chicken and corn chowder it was so good, but I couldn't finish it because it was so filling, but not in a heavy greasy way - just very satisfied with a delicious meal. We had to try their homemade ice cream and it did not disappoint either. The Peanut Butter ice cream was YUMMY! Everything that we ordered surpassed our expectations.\n\nIf you haven't tried this place - stop what you are doing and go check it out!!!!"
3,"The Great Dane on the square is my go-to place to take people when we are up near the Capitol - here are the reasons why:\n\n1) When we have visitors, there are almost always kids. LOTS of kids.  Today we had four adults and six kids.  The downtown Dane has a nice basement area with large tables that is perfect for big parties with children because, not only is there room, it's usually less busy so our rowdy kids won't bother nearly as many people.\n\n2) They have a humongous selection of food. If you can't find something you like at The Great Dane, you should probably just stay home. They have everything, including good options for kids and vegetarian meals that are marked with a little carrot to easily identify them.\n\n3) Beer is good for you. Especially beer that is not made by a big beverage company.  My favorite is the Crop Circle Wheat, but I'm a wheat beer girl, so anything with wheat makes me happy.\n\n4) The food is good. It's not the best food you are going to find in Madison, but it's good.  The Mac and Cheese (which I've probably eaten 10 times) can be really hit or miss. Sometimes it's amazing. Sometimes it needs more sauce.  Today I had the grilled cheese, which is really more of a vegetable sandwich with cheese.  This is the second time I've had this, and it was substantially better than the first.\n\nI really don't have anything bad to say about The Great Dane. Our server today seemed a little annoyed at having to serve a giant party of kids 5 and under, but one slightly peeved server does not a bad restaurant make...I think I said that right. ;)  \n\nWe will keep coming back to the Dane...it's a bit like a Madison institution at this point. ;)"
2,Hail ceasar was relatively boring.. Dressing was bland. Baby kale salad was really good. Turkey burger was okay... Don't get the gluten free bread! Drinks were good.
3,"I am definitely a fan.  Came here with my work buddies to try it out and we were all pleased.  I ordered the pork, chives and shrimp dumpling in the beef soup.  It was great!  I ate all 14 pieces.  Can't say these were among the best dumplings I had, but they definitely were better than most.  They've only been open a short time so I'll go back to give them another try.  \n\nMy buddies ordered noodles and fried rice.  Restaurant calls them appetizers but they're enough for a meal with leftovers.  Go give this place a try!"
1,"Came here to watch the Mummy 3 in order to avoid the crowd and labyrinth walkway at the MGM.  Bad decision - the A/C was barely on, seemed like it was off.   Outside was 110 degrees.  The casino was ice cold and enjoyed a margarita at the bar, but inside the cinema was hot and stuffy.   Won't come here again to watch a movie in Vegas but will go through the obstacles at MGM."
2,"I am all for the Nutella Milkshake!!! Honestly, I probably would never eat here if it wasn't for the Nutella milkshake and I kept talking about it all weekend that we ended up going there twice~\n\nService was good on both visits but the hostess won't sit anyone until the whole party arrives so that was a tad annoying. \n\nI tried:\nNutella Milkshake - amazing!!! The nutella was prominent and it was plain addictive. Pretty huge for one person, best to share since nutella is quite sweet\nStrawberry Banana Shake - pretty darn tasty, surprisingly light for a shake and not overly sweet\nCookie dough Shake - Not my favourite, had chunks of cookie dough with most of it blended in. Just like a light chocolate doughy shake\n\nLamb Burger - Well seasoned, a little gamey with a nice kick from the spices. Not bad but not my favourite.\nSalmon Burger - Amazing. The salmon fillet came looking like a patty (round) which was a tad alarming BUT it was just cut that way. Fresh and cooked a little rare in the middle, which was fine for us. I had it with a side of aioli n on a potato bun (both were delish). Zucchini fries were disappointing though.\n\n\nDefinitely be back since they open late, so we were able to go for a quick snack & nutella fix~"
3,"I want to complain, but I can't. Sure, it's not the fastest in the world but these are complicated transactions that take a while to process. The clerk who helped me was polite, knowledgeable and very friendly. I can't blame her for the $446 to transfer two cars to North Carolina.\n\nI was here about an hour, including the wait and my time at the counter.\n\nTip: They only accept cash or checks. No credit cards. There is an ATM in the corner with a $200 per transaction limit and $3 fee."
4,"Good start: the 32\"" dos x is $5.99. Fajitas $8.99 authentic looks, service and food,\nLovin it!"
4,"THE most legit glass shop in town. They've worked on two of my cars on a few separate occasions & have done nothing but an awesome job. While some glass shops leave you with wind noise, crooked glass, purple tint, or just a messy job in general, United Auto Glass very professionally installed original Lexus glass."
3,"Beagles might be one of my favorite watering holes.. EVER! As a local NoDa resident, I love how laid back and fun this bar is. No matter if you show up for Trivia on Tuesdays, to watch the game on Sunday or to just relax after a bike ride, Beagles is sure to make you happy.  Oh and their \""Jack Mac\"" mac & cheese.. stupid good.\n\nAnd you've gotta love a bar that has no sign out front :)"
1,I really love me some cupcakes. So when I found out this joint was serving cupcakes made by winners from cupcake wars - I was like HELL YES. So were they nice looking cupcakes? Yes. But you know they were just not that tasty at all. kind of dry. I got a coconut and got the birthday cake for my daughter since we were sampling to possibly purchase for her birthday party. I really wanted to love them. But I didnt. I might go back for some coffee but for the mean time im sticking to Sprinkles for my cupcakes.
2,This sushi spot is average at best. The rolls have too much rice and hardly any fish. I would rather pay extra and get more substance than just eat a bunch of rice. I wish they had some sort of seating. I go here when I need to grab a quick work day lunch. It's on par with grocery store grade pre made sushi
0,"Terrible! The food is terrible. Like really terrible. Everything tastes like fish.  How do you manage to make a chicken quesadilla taste like fish?  That shouldn't even be possible.\nService was so slow.  Took forever to get a menu, order, and get food.\nAnd it's fucking cold in there. I didn't come to the desert to have rock hard nipples from how cold I am."
2,"What the fuck?  Did you say this place is All-You-Can-Eat?  Whenever I go to an All-You-Can-Eat place, I always try to get my money's worth.  This time...big mistake.\n\nWhat? Chicken? Get in my bowl biatch!  \nBeef? Get in my bowl biatch!\nOnions?  Do it now!\nCilantro, green onions, cabbage, broccoli, mushrooms, pineapple, zucchini?...all right I'll try some healthy shit.  \nAll these saaauwces!!!  Cause tonight, I'm the saauwce boss!  \nWhatchyou know about stir fry?\n\n4 plates later, I was in the most wicked food coma I've ever experienced.\nAdvice...go easy on the sauce."
0,"Due to my downtown Tempe location I've been getting flyers from Gus's taped onto my door for years.  A couple nights ago, I had a wicked hunger smack me in the face around 1am, so I decided to give Gus's pizza a shot.\n\nGus's flyers all scream about online ordering, so I wandered to their site and thought I'd give that a try.  I noticed right away that next to their $1.50 delivery charge was a 49 cent \""service fee.\""  Being a poor college student, I decided to skip the fees and just call in for takeaway.  \n\nI call, speak to some almost-unintelligible knucklehead, and order my 18\"" pepperoni, sausage, and garlic using one of the many coupons that have collected on my desk.  Knucklehead says twenty minutes and I thank him, chuckle at amusing youtube videos for ten minutes, and then make the five minute drive to guarantee that my pizza will be fresh from the oven.\n\nI hit up Delhi Palace a couple times a month so I know the location, but I had never been inside Gus's before.  I was immediately unimpressed.  Behind the counter was some mid-forties guido complete with slicked back hair and gold chain around his neck, and a couple of other guys who appeared to be trying as hard as they could to avoid working.\n\nI tell them I'm here, and guido turns to chump number one, whose job it apparently was to make my pizza. It turns out he hadn't done so yet, so he tossed it together, threw it in the oven, and told me it'll be ready as soon as it's ready.  I pay (using cash to avoid yet another fee), sit down, and listen to the banter between the knuckleheads behind the counter and the disturbing douchebag at the table behind me, who apparently likes women much shorter than him that he can dominate.  Mothers, watch your daughters.  No, not the ones at ASU, the ones in junior high.  \n\nMy pizza was finally done after about 15 minutes of angry birds, so I took it home and popped open the box.  The toppings all appeared to be right, but the smell was off.  Who knows, maybe they use the magical ingredient that makes their pizza as good as all of the one-review five-star sockpuppets who have reviewed Gus's say it is, but no.  Instead, I'm eating bland crust, oversweet sauce, and some form of dried chunks of garlic rather than the fresh garlic I was expecting between my meh pepperoni and tombstone-quality sausage.\n\nIt's important to try many things in life, but now that I've tried Gus's pizza I can safely say I'll never be back.  I don't care how drunk or hungry I may be, and how late it has gotten, Gus's is off the list."
0,If you want a real workout than don't go to this gym.. The staff have some sort of mental issues.. They're really down and they don't like to be friendly in any shape or form. I want to ask them what their problem is... But instead I joined another gym.  Their STAFF SUCKS!!!!
2,"The service was outstanding! Our 8 year old girls were cold and the Venetian sets the thermostat so there is nothing they can do about it. The manager brought over two tablecloths for them to wrap up in!\n\nThe Sunday Gravy is very good. The cheese board is a bit average. The Italian fish was liked and so were the meatballs.\n\nThe lower rating is due to the dessert menu. It is limited and not very good. We ordered the apple turnover, tiramisu, cannollis, ice cream, lemon blueberry cheesecake and the hazelnut chocolate cake. The ice cream is great, but not home made and the only other great dessert was the hazelnut chocolate cake. Everything else was very average. What a surprise!\n\nYou have to walk by their bakery across the hall and you see the pastry chefs make these amazing looking desserts through a glass window, but none of them are on the menu! I expected fabulous dessert, but it was pretty disappointing."
4,I'm writing this in anticipation of a wonderful next meal here based on our previous dining experiences. The manager contacted me and offered a complimentary chefs dinner next time we're in Las Vegas. He apologized for our last dinner. I'm very impressed that the restaurant cares enough about their food and reputation to do this. Thank you.
1,"We wanted to check out the gay scene in Pittsburgh and since we were staying downtown this seemed like a great place. Positives: doorman was nice and they played good music. \n\nNegatives: the lighting, the decor and the smoking. The smoking was really disgusting actually as the smell lingered in our hair and our clothes after we left; I think they should consider opening up a little smoking area, just a thought. As for drinks, we ordered lemon drop martinis and I know, this is so far from being a martini bar, but the bartender did a pretty great job.\n\nGlad we went, but we won't go back."
3,"Located on the fifth floor at the Phoencian resort, J&G Steakhouse is a dark, open, sophisticated space. If your schedule is flexible, I would recommend dining around sunset to get that extra ambiance. However, even at 8 pm (that is the time we had reservations), the twinkling lights in the distance gave an extra romantic feel.\n\nMy husband and I decided to have a date night on Friday night, and we chose J&G since it was Restaurant Week and we had been wanting to try it. As most other reviews have said, the service is incredibly lacking and is only 2 stars. Luckily the food is exceptional and pretty much makes you forget how poor the service is that you are receiving. \n\nWe both ordered the RW menu - I had the caesar salad, parmesan crusted chicken, and the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. The caesar salad was very fresh and for an appetizer was quite large. The chicken was the highlight for me. You get two nice sized chicken breasts (I could only eat 3/4 of one because they were so large)...the chicken was so incredibly moist. Plus the parmesan crust on the chicken gave it an upscale fried chicken feel and had a hint of saltiness to it which I loved. The chocolate cake was sinful - once you broke into the cake, there was molten chocolate inside which was complimented perfectly by the ice cream. My husband loved all of his food (tomato soup, hanger steak with fries, apple tart) and even shared the french fries that came with his steak with me (the fries were salty and delicious). With our entrees, we also ordered a side of the mashed potatoes which were amazing. They were so smooth and had just the right amount of butter in them. I only wish the side had been bigger because we argued over who got the last scoop!\n\nFor a beer, two RW menus, and a side of mashed potatoes, our bill before tip came to $79 which we thought was great. For a nice, resort steakhouse, the prices on the regular J&G menu are incredibly reasonable and we are already planning another trip back to try more items on the menu!"
1,"Asthma and respiratory sufferers avoid this place like the plague.  It stinks to high heaven of cheap teen cologne.  The merchandise is still over priced and staff is dumber than a box of rocks.  On the plus side, it's a great place for decent men's sweat pants.  Just make sure you don't pay full price.  Also wash the clothes when you get them home,  they will stink like their cologne."
3,"Reviewing about the swimming pool/steam room and sauna.\n\nI have been using these facilities since September 2013. I chose to join their club due to a corporate offer they had: \u00a330 per month including gym, sauna, swim, steam room at no additional cost, longer hours than the Dalry leisure pool and closer to my office. \n\nAdditionally, they offer courtesy towel, shower gel and shampoo in showers that have curtains. No need to have coins to use a locker - staff will give you a key when they scan and keep your membership card. \n\nUnfortunately the pool is only 12meters long, but it's not that busy as other places I have been so you could swim in circles if you like! \n\nSauna reaches only up to 93 degrees roughly - I would love it being a bit warmer. \n\nFrom time to time the shampoo or shower gel might have finished in two of the three showers so you need to look for one that still have some, but if you bring your own no need to worry. \n\nBetter have your sandals with you, as people will walk with their shoes in the area where you walk after your shower and go to change next to your locker. \n\nStill a member and yes, recommending it!"
0,"Went there today for lunch with a group of 7.  Not one person had anything good to say about their food.  Even the BOGO pasta person was dissatisfied.  The restaurant was practically empty and the service was extremely slow.  I had their chopped salad to start which was described as having tomatoes, bleu cheese, and prosciutto among the ingredients.  They were so sparse and tiny that it practically took a magnifying glass to see them amongst all the lousy iceberg.  A definite ripoff and disappointment.  My entree wasn't terrible--ordered off the light menu.  \n\nEven though we specified when we ordered how we wanted the checks split; at the close of the meal, we were told by our server that their system wouldn't do that and that we should pass around the master bill and figure it out for ourselves.  After getting a manager involved and quite a lengthly wait, we finally got our totals and were out of there.  This lunch experience in a nearly empty restaurant took almost 2 hrs.  All around a huge disappointment.  I definitely won't be going back!"
4,"Hands down best dentist on the planet! \nComing off a very bad experience with Floss Dental I was apprehensive about this place but right from the moment I stepped into the place I had a good feeling about it. No frills, overly sweet and chatty staff, just a good, quiet, state-of-the-art dental facility. After my xrays Dr. Lee explained to me in a matter of fact manner all the problems with my teeth. (The last dentists had told me things were not so bad and then drew me up a $8000 plan to fix what was wrong!). Dr. Lee did not at any stage push me to do any unnecessary cosmetic procedure. I have started my treatment with him (it'll be a long process) and so far I'm very happy with his work and his office environment."
3,"I had a craving for Mexican food tonight... which happens rarely enough that I should I should indulge. I had no idea where to get good Mexican food in Champaign, but a quick Yelp search brought up Fiesta Cafe, which is conveniently located just a few blocks from my apartment, and also stays open everyday until 12am (an oddity in Champaign where a lot of restaurants are closed by 10pm). \n\nSo I decided to check it out: I didn't actually eat there, only got food to go, but the restaurant seems pleasant enough that I will probably go back soon. I ordered the chicken mole, and it turned out to be quite good... in fact, surprisingly good and quite better than most Mexican food I had while I was in NYC. It's also very reasonably priced, and the service was very friendly. Nice place!"
4,"My wife and I went there last night for our anniversary.  The service was first-rate, from start to finish.  The wait staff was friendly and helpful without ever being obtrusive or (as is sometimes the case in high end restaurants) condescending.  \n\nThe food was delicious, from starters to main courses to dessert.  There was a touch too much salt in a couple of the dishes for my taste, but otherwise everything was interesting, fresh, attractively presented, and tasty.  \n\nThe decor was spare, but tasteful.  The view is, of course, magnificent.  And there isn't really a bad table in the restaurant, upstairs or down.\n\nFinally, considering what you get, I think that the pricing is very reasonable.  I will definitely go back!"
4,Gina was great and I really enjoyed the service - thank you!!!!
0,"FINALLY! Moving out from Biltmore apartments after the WORST customer service from office staff and maintenance. I still have a gapping hole in my ceiling after the staff tried to spackle over the wet hole several times! The apartment smells of mildew, I see mold growing on the frame of the closet where they replaced the carpet but didn't fix the leak. Several of my neighbors have had leaks as well as a lot of downstairs apartments are vacant and windows fogged up from water problems. The hole has gotten worse the last few weeks because they turn off the AC chiller not real AC to migrate to heat... While the weather in AZ is still high 70s the mild has gotten worse and the hole bigger because of stagnant air. I turned in. Vacate notice with my complaints and still have yet to hear from the office to alleviate my situation. Horrible place do not rent!!"
4,"Very glad to have found and chosen this salon. Sign up was very easy, everyone I've met has been wonderful and helpful, and it's a national company so you can visit ANY palm beach tan in country. Lotion is a little pricey in-store, though."
1,"Normally I love sake bombers. I've been coming here for about a year now and have never had a bad thing to say. Tonight however, our service was a joke. It took well over 30 minutes to get two rolls and the restaurant was almost empty. And our server (Emily) rarely checked on us. And when she would, she wasn't personable at all. Right up until she dropped off our checks she didn't treat us like a a server should treat a customer. And My friends and I are all servers so it takes a lot for us to not tip 20%... I tipped her 15% and I felt like it was more than she deserved. Very disappointed in the way we were treated."
3,"Overall I like their food. Lots of chips and great salsa..both hot and mild. always free and as many as you can eat. Beer is cold cold cold. staffer pleasant and prompt. great with drink refills. All items are delicious. Sopapillas...really good.  Best mexican food around. Pleasant , casual atmosphere and not expensive. good value for the money."
1,"First time going to Vegas,  and I must say, I picked the WRONG HOTEL. I went for my 21st birthday this past weekend and I wish I had put more time in searching for better places to stay.\n\nUnpacking: I put my make up bag on the nightstand and it tipped over. My lipstick rolled and fell on the other side. When I bent down to look for it,  there was a birthday present waiting for me... A USED TAMPON!! OMG!! \nI didn't make a big deal about it because it was my birthday,  and I wasn't gonna let a damn thing ruin my weekend,  however,  I did mention it at checkout and the receptionist was expressionless.  He didn't do a damn thing about it.\n\n2nd: There is a $25/day service charge on top of the hotel cost for staying here.  WHAT SERVICE? My room wasn't even clean when I checked in. Coffee,  which is normally complementary at other hotels is $12. That's right. $12 for a cup of coffee you have to make yourself. \nThirsty? Stay Thirsty. A bottle of water is $7. My friends stayed at the same hotel and they drank the waters and later replaced them with ones they bought from 7/11. SMART!\n\nThe pool area was nice,  but you can't sit on their couches after a certain hour because they rent them out.\n\nAgain, I don't know what the service charge is for if there is absolutely NO SERVICE.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this hotel 2 stars is because they gave me about 25 free alcoholic beverages.  That's right. I just turned 21 so I still look underage.  So I went down to the casino and acted like I was gambling. Every 15 minutes or so, a waitress came and asked me if I wanted anything to drink JUST TO CHECK MY ID! PATHETIC. But I got a kick out of it. I got shitfaced without spending a dime. Thank you. I'll make sure to stay at a different hotel,  but come here for free drinks next time (:"
4,"I was pleasently surprised. I haven't had good crepe in a while. The avalon was pretty amazing and not too heavy on the goat cheese. Somehow it was just the way I liked it. \nThe environment is cute and quant (Even their bathrooms) \nThe best part was the their service. The place is really small, but he staff will go out if their way to find a seat for you.\nI'll definitely be coming  back"
1,"Update 2014. It went from a 4 Star to a 2 Star for us.\n\nWe keep coming here hoping it gets better, but not always. Here is what we miss:\n\n-The high quality chili oil with ground dried shrimp. Server says too expensive to offer.\n-They used to give out a small dish of peanuts as an appetizer. No longer.\n-Dishes \""appear\"" smaller even when the head cook is there (see below) as observed over the past few months.\n\nFor a long term customer (been coming since opening week), this is dissapointing to make these small cuts. Also, the size of the dishes are getting smaller so it seems. Perhaps it was the afternoon cook (we arrived at 5:15). We noticed the main cook arriving and the dishes for the table next to us were larger (but not as before). I asked if the Singapore Noodles can be made with rice noodles (fun) instead of rice stick noodles, the server went to ask and was told the head cook was not there so it couldn't be done. Really? You can't switch the type of noodles? What a Noodle Head! Mind you, this is not a rant over our experience yesterday, but something that has been going on."
4,"Salad, chicken and waffels, and the lamb burger.  So good."
4,"GO SEE THIS SHOW.....\nWe were sceptical as the movie was terrible.  I am so happy we went.  The narrator was SO funny!!  Very funny,  great music...LOVE!!"
4,"Fresh seafood, attentive staff, and a nice physical layout. \n\nFirst time visit for AYCE lunch. Will be back!"
1,"Brunch was the goal. I'm not really sure what I left with. I was full, but I would hardly call anything they had on the menu as brunch. The food was average. The prices were a little on the high side. I did have an incredible coffee!\n\nHere's the problem in having a bathroom in the middle of the dinning room... when one coffee drinking patron went in for evacuation everyone HAD to smell it. Ouuffff.... Luckily I had paid but was on my way out. Not cool."
1,"I have been here three times now. For some reason a lot of my coworkers really like it. It's a popular lunch-time destination. \n\nThey are known for their southern, Louisiana style dishes. I would say it's just pretty typical, heaving-tasting foods. Their gyros are not bad actually, but the creole with shrimp and blacken fish I had as a lunch special were just too salty and heavy for me. I'm sure some who love their soul food would appreciate it, but it wasn't for me. \n\nIt gets pretty crowded during lunch hours, and the spaces are quite tight."
0,"I had a rock chip in my windshield.About three weeks after it happened, I stopped at Cobblestone to have it repaired so my windshield would not crack. About three times they told me that they \""guarantee their work\"".\nTwo days after the did the repair, my windshield cracked, starting from where they did the 'repair\"". When I went to Cobblestone, and explained the problem, ti turns out that the \""guarantee\"" is that they refund your insurance company the $30 they charged for the repair! Some 'Guarantee\""!\nAdditionally, the manager approached me as I was warning another customer, and thinking he was real cute, told me to get in my car and get my drugs, then 'what have you been smoking?' How professional.\nThis is not an honest establishment, nor do they do good work.\nI would recommend hiring professionals to work on your car, not children."
0,"This place was horrible.  The room was a deluxe.  No coffee maker.  Dirty bathroom and you can hear people from the rooms on both sides talking.  The water was shut off from 11 AM till 4PM with no notice up front.  We went into the room after gambling all night to get a voice mail at 4 AM.  The manager was rude and disrespectful,  We had not used the room but, she refused to refund if we left.  She lied and said the hotel was fully booked and when we told her the clerk said there were rooms available she said, \""Oh, that was nice of her.\""  What a joke.\n\nTried to save a buck.  You get what you pay for.  Low rates = Low class service.  Motel Six MGM!  Never go budget again!"
4,"In my opinion, this is the best Portuguese bakery in Montreal. Perfectly located near Romados, you cannot go wrong with anything you get here as all the pastries are always fresh. The natas have a crunchy flaky crust and a not too sweet creamy custard. Not quite the selection of what you would find in Lisbon, Portugal but this is absolute heaven for your sweet tooth! Obrigado!"
3,We tried it and liked it.  I thought it was better than most!  Traditional Mexican food and plenty of seafood options - or at least more than most.  It's always crowded and was recommended to us by an Arrowhead resident.
1,"I like the ambiance and feel of Grassroots - however, the cook has a bit of an attitude. \nWhen I explained this was the second time I had come in and they were out of what I  wanted to order he said because everything is fresh. Ok-I can appreciate and love that! However, I was asking for a baked potato. How can you be out of baked potatoes? That seems pretty standard. He then went on to say they are doing pretty well.....what?? How about just apologizing for not being able to accommodate your customer. Lose the attitude.  Food is par - I would recommend this place for drinks only."
1,"I can only review the drinks because we had to leave. The drinks were good, although the bartenders acted like they were doing you a favor by paying attention to you.\n \nWe had to leave because it was so LOUD and CROWDED and CLAUSTROPHOBIC. Bar patrons were so packed in that they were literally rubbing their asses on the edge of our table and these two hags acted like there was a competition to see who could scream and cackle the loudest. I'm no \""fuddy-duddy\"" either! \n\nI remember my first beer..."
4,Absolutely amazing! Brings a whole new dimension to hot dogs. Only the best ingredients and cooked to perfection. I had no idea that a dog this different could be so wonderful - Simply Outstanding
1,"This place is clearly very popular, it was filled the entire time we were there with many people who appeared to be regulars.  We went there for the veggie options.  The seitan appetizer was really good, and a huge portion, but the rest of the meal was not so great.\nThe service was kinda crazy.  Our waiter was nice, but pretty non-existent, and the rest of the staff seemed crazy and frazzled."
0,"What a horrible experience.  Room service sucked. 1 1/2 hours after ordering they \""no showed.\"" The tv constantly screwed up. The pool was a horrible mess.... One girl was puking in a garbage can. The one-on-one staff was very helpful & kind but getting ahold of anyone takes literally 20 minutes on hold. It's sad because the employees are very willing to provide great service but the management seems to be a total mess!"
2,"It's actually called the Huntridge Diner. I went here for lunch last week and yeah I guess it was A-ok. I had the daily special, which for Tuesday is a Burger, Fries and Soda for $6.95. The burger didn't taste like much but it wasn't bad. The fries probably came from Sysco but they were battered and pretty tasty. Everyone was very friendly including the girl at the front cashier counter and even the cook. Besides me there was only one other customer in there so the service was good."
1,"Went there for dinner a few nights ago as we wanted to check out a new spot. We don't mind paying for good quality food. Our waitress was over the top sometimes. Basically read the whole menu to us when we said it was our first time. We had already had time to read the menu and we can read so that was about five minutes of our time she totally wasted. She then compared AG to Maestro's and Ruth Chris which was a huge mistake. I love Maestro's lobster mashed potatoes so when she made that comparison and I saw it on the menu I was like ok, this should be great. NOT. They were runny and EXTREMELY salty. The rub on the steak was also very salty. I think someone in the kitchen has a strong salt fetish and obviously no one is QC what is leaving the kitchen w/ a small taste test. I ordered the Sea Bass and the fish was in like a pyramid shape that made the fish about 3 inches tall and very thick. Obviously this type of uneven cut will affect the cooking. So I felt the inside was cooler and not as done as the thinner, outside parts and that made my stomach turn. Who cuts a fish like this? I have never seen that done. Then the lovely complimentary butter cake came for being our first time there. It's their \""signature\"" dessert. BLAH, it did not impress me. Sorry I seem hard to please but when you set an expectation and compare yourself to 5-star restuarants, I expect you to deliver. Maybe try under promising and over delivering."
0,Waited for 45 minutes for my husband to get his hair cut because he was skipped. When we asked if he was next they said he had one person in front of him when the only other person in the place came in after us. There were five people working and only one cutting hair. The rest stood up at the register. They said it was cause they couldn't figure out their new system. I don't see how it took 4 people to figure it out. We just left. Lost our business.
1,The food is just okay. I have had better. Service is slow.
0,"To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. \n\nWhat an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead."
1,"Normally, if we walk out of a restaurant feeling hungry ,still, I would give it one star. But the food here is good, actually, a lot better than the other ones I have been to in PHX area. \nWe don't expect to take leftovers home, but need to be able to wait 4-5 hours before we need to look for food again. When we walked out Takeda that day, my husband said, \""we got to find something else.\"" I had two restaurants myself in the past. One thing I learned is; if you want your customers to return, you have to at least make sure they are not leaving your restaurant hungry!"
2,"What's wrong with me?!? I love popcorn but this place just didn't do it for me. Love the concept, merchandise, staff is incredibly friendly and generous with samples. I must agree with Mur T. I miss the popcorn smell and the availability of fresh popcorn. I did buy three different flavors, Chicago, Vegas and a chocolate but I think I was a little turned off by the way they are just stored in big containers in the back. I'm also not a fan of the hard shell coating. I think Maw N Paw in So Cal and Garrett's in Chicago have spoiled me."
0,"The only reason I am giving this a one star is because this was my second time there, and this time, they messed up on processing my credit card and charge me $84.01 for my chicken wings. the lady said she voided it, then swiped my card again and fixed the price, 5 days later it was still taken out of my bank account. My bank is going to fix this for me, but I should not have had to go through all this hassle just for these dang wings. Because of this mistake of theirs I will find another wing place. I mean what if I had needed that money for a bill or something. Get it together."
2,"I went back to Rancho De Tia Rosa on May 8, 2008 -- It's still ok, but not bad for the area.  I'll stick to the original Rosa's out on University.\n\nThis will be the place for meeting my friends who live on that side of town."
0,"Wish I could give \""0\"" stars as this is truly deserved and here's why...we came today (Sunday big NFL day for Panthers). We expected it to be busy so we knew we'd have to wait. We put our name on the list and proceeded to wait for a table in the bar area. We saw a table open up and we knew we were next on the list so I went to the hostess and she told me that the Manager put a hold on seating people because the kitchen was backed up. I asked to speak to the Manager and let her know there was a table available and since we were there to watch the game (like everyone else!), we really just wanted to sit and have a couple beers and were in no rush for food anyways. While all this going on, another couple took the table with no wait. She comes back (manager is a female, short with long dark hair in a ponytail) and offered us to share a table with another guy who had just ordered a beer. Ridiculous can't even describe this manager!!  Common sense tells you if you have a long wait and there are open tables (because the Manager is telling the hostess not to seat anyone), disorganization and people just taking tables unfortunately is the next scenario. Other than being offered a wonderful option of sharing a table with a complete stranger (which she approached him on and he did not offer up himself...awkward??), we were offered nothing else. We will NEVER go back!!!"
2,Amore is now closed and the store is cleared out.
4,"I had tried this place before for lunch and thought it was just OK.  I've since tried the brunch and, let me tell you, that's where it's at!  Oh my goodness, so delicious!  We sometimes plan our whole trip around making it to that weekend brunch.  It's outstanding!  Our favorites are the Steak & Eggs, Chilaquiles, and Coconut and French Toast.  Skip the shrimp BLT--pretty strange."
2,"This is for the club portion:\n- Dark\n- Expensive\n- Weak drinks\n- Small\n-Stairs and drunk people don't mix\n- You'll have to scoot on off your seat if somebody wants to buy a bottle. \n\n+ You can smoke, which is a plus for me\n+ Coat check man and bathroom lady were very nice\n+ Everybody else is about as drunk as you are, so who the fuck cares how lame it truly is."
2,"Hakkasan is located inside the MGM grand. I was on the GL so we went to the GL line and it was free before 1am, so we had to hurry our asses there! We made it & it was free, thank god! Anywayyys, bouncers were nice and they made our transition inside the club pretty smoothly. Once we got in, I immediately noticed how SMALL it was. The dancefloor was sooooo tiny! :( When I finally made my way over, I could barely move/dance. It was literally body to body ... and this was on a day where there's NO ONE famous dj-ing! So imagine how bad the crowd would get if Tiesto or Hardwell was up there .... I wouldn't wanna be there! \n\nBut that's all I can really say because I got super messed up and I can't remember anything else. Only that I couldn't dance at all because there was no room and the parts where it's kinda open, the security made you move :("
4,"Yoga Pants is amazing! WOB you have to get these guys back in here again. They only take requests... They have a keyboard and drums... Fire drill. Both guys play and sing, absolutely awesome ! You guys rock loved every minute if it!"
0,"This place is clean and the food is pretty good. But make sure u give yourself enough time for lunch!!! I had bad service there three times I was there. 1st in only asked how long my carry out will be the guy was like\"" do I see we have ppl here to service too?!?\"" He answered. \"" I just want to know how long it will take\"" I replied. The 2nd time i figured I ordered over the phone but it took me 15 min for the manger/ owner to understand what u wanted!!! He barely speak English and have a heavy accent. Not very nice in the phone ! No customer sever skill! I ended up cancelled the ordered and re think if I will ever order from them again!!!!!!! Not recommended !"
4,Perfect for the locals to avoid the hectic crowd and pricing of other theaters at the casinos.  No need to park at  a casino and pass through it to find the theater.
4,"Great service, professional, great price, lots of selection, def come back here again! And highly recommend!!!"
2,We always eat at El Pollo Loco in California and we needed a little snack so decided to stop by. Apparently they changed the names of some of the things on their menu and did not have the soft chicken tacos I normally order or my husband's classic burrito.\n\nBecause of no soft chicken tacos I ordered the Taco Al Carbon and the husband ordered the El Tradicional burrito that was supposedly like the classic. We dug in since we were hungry and realized I prefer the old soft chicken tacos they used to have. Don't forget to grab salsa. My fave if the Avocado Salsa and Salsa Roja which is a little bit spicy. \n\nOverall good place to grab a quick bite. Still getting used to their new options on the menu. I love chicken so I really like this place.
4,"Mouth watering dishes! All of them! Yeah, I'm the type to pick off everyone's plates. Don't judge me! and I'm Such a sucker for outdoor patios!! Vegas weather does get a bit crazy, but you have a choice\nOf sitting in the indoor patio! What? Yes!! Get the steak and the sandwiches. all of them. Take it Togo if you can't finish it cause it taste equally amazing hours later in traffic or on the plane!"
1,"Horrible!  We waited for over an hour for 3 gluten free fried rice dishes and one other dish.  Finally had to ask to see the manager.  He was stunned we were waiting. Many, many other tables had come and gone.  Our waitress never once came to our table to talk about the wait.  The manager then claimed it was because we had gluten free.  We eat at PF Changs often. This was not a gluten free - takes an hour issue.  It was a bad waitress and cook staff issue!  Will not go back to this location ever!"
1,"There was nothing remarkable about this place.  We went on a Saturday night and it was DEAD.  We were running late so we called and asked if they could hold our reservations for 30 minutes.  The hostess said that they were packed and they could only hold it for 10 minutes.  We rushed from our hotel, only to find that the place was dead! There was plenty of seating indoors and outdoors.  Our server was nice, but the service was slow.  The food was average.  From what I hear, the Pink Taco in LA is much better and tons of fun."
4,Pier 83 is one of our family's favorite restaurants in the valley. I was a newbie fish eater when we first went and have since learned to love all kinds of fish. It's fresh so it doesn't have that really strong fish flavor that a lot of places seem to have. My husband's family is from the Pacific Northwest and they say this is the best fresh fish place in town. With Monday Madness Specials and all you can eat Alaskan Cod Pier 83 is very reasonable and could fit most budgets. \n\nEverything is good here! It's a clean hole in the wall place with a neat and friendly atmosphere. Kids and Land Lovers would be able to eat here as well.
2,"I came in hoping some egg tarts might be there, but of course that is always out first. The BF and I just grabbed some snacks for later.\n\nThe loot:\n\nGreen onion roll with pork sung- this was okay. The bread and sung was good, but I can barely get the green onion flavor. Thats really what I love normally about this is that strong flavor blend of the sweet bread, salty pork and savory onions....but it was missing part of the trifecta. \n\nSteamed Chicken Bun- pretty good. I would get it again if I'm in the area, but I would say it's pretty standard. It's just as good as the ones I got at the deli in the supermarket (168 has them in 4 packs). \n\nGreen Tea bread- the bread was good and the flavor seemed good but the swirls of green tea paste in the bread was really goopy, slimy almost so I didn't enjoy much of it. \n\nBF got pineapple bun and he ate it up so it must have been good. Honey crisps- still have it left over...a bit too oily. \n\nThe skinny is that this place is A-OK. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I'll come back for certain items when I'm in the area and to try to get some of these egg tarts."
3,"I have purchased a few small items here and the iPhone 4. My iPhone 4 experience, only the first day of availability was from 4:30 am to 1:50 pm. Once inside, the activation and purchase went smoothly was out of the store by 2:30 pm. This store is open usually until 11pm at the time of this review, which is nice if you need something late."
0,"Wherever you are, eat where locals eat... this is not one of them...service is terrible,  and food is a long way from being 100% French... just another tourist trap...."
2,"Remember  the days when you could watch a movie for $1?  I don't, but I hear folks reminiscing about them.  Old timer or not, Cinemark is the pretty decent place if you want to watch movies just out of rotation at the major theaters.Admission on the weekends is $2.25!  During the week its only $2 and $1 on Tuesdays.  Located behind the Krispy Kreme in Matthews (just look for the 'Hot' sign), the place looks like Pee Wee Herman's playhouse on the inside.  But I can forgive that.  \n\nThey show movies generally two months after their original release date.  Its your typical movie-fare, but   occasionally they throw in an indie or foreign film.  Look for the CineArts logo on the Showtimes page of the website. \n\nPlease be forewarned however: the concession stand is NOT discount price.  A large popcorn and drink runs $9.  Also, if you're going on a Fri or Sat., there will be a lot of teens.  They have cracked down on teen loitering in recent years, but certain teen-friendly movies might not be fun to watch on the weekend.  However, Cinemark Matthews Movies makes a good cheap date or fills a boring weeknight.  Netflix and Redbox watch out!"
2,"Checked this place out since I wanted some boba.  This place is quick.  They offer a wide variety of fresh fruits.   l liked the Milk Tea with Boba and Lychee Jelly.  We all tried something different, Peanut Butter and Banana w/ no Boba, Red Bean w/ boba and Lychee and coconut w/ boba.  All were a hit.  Looking for something fresh on a hot day, recommend checking this spot out.\nI think they have a $5 min. if you want to use your credit card."
0,"Oh, Come Back Inn. You may be a relative of Hotel Rubie Marie, but you are a distant one to say the least. I live a block up from this restaurant, and seeing as I has never been before, I decided to eat dinner here. Before the shit storm starts, let me say that the style of the place is very cool, if not a step back in time to a different social era. It is disturbing to note that there was a very discriminatory atmosphere that night. I was shocked to overhear the lady who manages dismissing gay marriage as a \""fad\""... I actually feared for my safety as the manager seemed to have set a bad tone within the restaurant. The food was pretty good, but I'm afraid that was ultimately meaningless, as  the atmosphere was not accepting of others... This manager has some explaining to do."
3,"While it doesn't surprise me that Aria T'Loak has an establishment in Las Vegas, I am a little surprised it would be such a posh and fancy place.  Maybe I just expected that because of what I've seen in Omega, not that Afterlife isn't a cool club, but this place is more along the lines of Purgatory at the Citadel, with its modern decor and all.  Just goes to show you that the Pirate Queen is full of surprises!"
2,"We were staying at the Royal Palms for a couple of days and everyday we would have breakfast at T Cooks. It was delicious. \n\nMost memorable the frittata with artichokes and sundried tomates. \n\nDinner wasn't so great - I wouldn't recommend. The dishes were too strongly flavored for the ingredients. I had a mushroom soup that I couldn't finish - it was way to intense.  Also had a monkfish wrapped with bacon which is normally a great combo but I'm not sure what oil they fry with or what amount they used, the dish was over powered and the freshness of the ingredients were lost."
0,"The customer service here is AWFUL!  The manager is less than nice, even at the best of times. \nI was at Zipps recently for several college ball games, where thank goodness Megan our server was amazing, because the rest of the service was horrible.\nNot only was I in attendance for bad behavior on management's part, but also able to read an atrocious letter written to a friend simply because she wrote a bad review.\nI will NEVER be stepping foot in Zipps again, and will be forwarding the letter to ALL my friends. \nThe food isnt that great, and the beer is cheaper is most other establishments, where management is generally nicer. \nI only wish I could give ZERO STARS!"
2,"Sandwiches are good. Prices are good (for Vegas). Open 24 hours a plus. However, I don't know how much out of the way I would go just to eat here, esp if there was a long line. Definitely better than Subways or Quiznos. It's good, but not NOM-ilicious great. I have to say I liked their bread a lot though."
3,"The Burger Company is a smart new contender in an up and coming area of Wesley Heights. They opened Monday April 5th to big crowds, mainly neighbors clamoring for a new restaurant to walk to especially to watch NCAA tourney finals on all their big screens. The space is a big open warehouse space with a sizeable bar.\n\nNow to the menu: they focus on burgers (duh blondie), but their mantra is fresh and affordable. We spoke with the owners and he put plainly \""If we don't nail a menu item in the next couple days it's off the menu. I only want to have things we excel at.\""  They really thought through all their menu choices such as choosing to only have a 5oz burger to keep it affordable (which to me is on the small side and you need another menu item). Affordable it is- a plain burger is only $4, and most of their specialty ones are $5 and $6 at most. You can add a patty for $1.50. I would prefer a choice to upgrade to a larger 7 or 8oz patty as a jumbo option- they grind their own meat there, so a thicker patty could offer a more rare option, but I get their mantra and in this economy I don't blame them. The beef was a little more lean than I expected it to be. They also offer a \""stuffed\"" patty option which has American cheese in the middle. Other menu options include a marinated grilled chicken sandwich (I'll try that next time), some funny salads including a \""Man Salad\"", and good wings. I recommend the hot honey BBQ flavor.  Once Pinky's Westside Grill opens across the street I bet they'll have some competition for their good fried pickles. We tried their sweet potato tater tots with cinnamon butter. The owner was undecided if that would remain on the menu. The sweet potato fries are actually waffle fries. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, so if you want a $12 gourmet burger, go to Liberty. If you want a place you can go in your tattered tshirt to watch the game and not blow a wad of cash, come to the Burger Company. Service was apathetic at best, but hopefully that was opening jitters. The owners seem very open to feedback and were very friendly. I forgot to suggest adding a turkey burger. \n\nEvery day they'll have a $1.50 draft special and they have an extensive martini/cocktail list for a place like that. Wesley Heights will be glad to have a good neighborhood bar now. They have outdoor seating and plan a winter heated patio on the side as well.\nI think they'll do just fine. It's so close to uptown and SouthEnd I think it will work well. \n\nNo website yet, but they are on Facebook and you can find their menu on there."
4,"This place was awesome! We tried what we felt were their best offerings. The tequenyos, domino empanada, pabellon arepa, gouda chachapa, and the pabellon patacon. You want to eat the pabellon patacon! The gouda chachapa was also a home run. Can't wait to go back!"
4,I had an issue with plumbing and did needed it fixed that evening.  Service was quick (only had an hour window) an problem was fixed quickly.  I definitely recommend Freddy Fox Rooter
1,I had the lunch special Mini-Pizza while traveling through Tempe.  It was too salty.  Not pleasant.  The ambiance was very noisy.  The service was slow.  I would not go back.
3,"Mmmmmm... burger bar...\n\nOkay, so we found this place in a Japanese guide book and we were worried that it might not still be around... so we schlepped out there and arrived to find the place was hopping. We didn't have to wait too long to get a seat.\n\nThe menu at this place is amazing. Basically, you construct a burger with whatever toppings you want. And they have pretty much everything. It was everything I could do not to go hog wild and make the most expensive burger known to man, so I went with a spicy buffalo theme. I ordered the buffalo (delicious cow like animal) and got jalapenos and pepper jack, the fried zuccini, and a chocolate banana shake (not on the menu, but they made it anyway). The wife had salmon.\n\nI was in burger heaven. I mean, it was really one of the best burgers I've ever had in my entire life. The wife wasn't enjoying her salmon and so she wasn't too pleased. She was happier when I gave her the rest of my shake though (cause it was soooo good).\n\nAnyway, one little detail that I thought was awesome was that when my jalapenos came, there were picked ones and fresh ones. And they had ketchup, mustard, and A1 sauce at every table.\n\nSo, in the end, the waitress was kind of a bitch, but this random other dude kept helping us out, so we left her a little tiny tip and gave the random dude some gambling chips, and we were off.\n\nExcellent place, come with the guys."

2,"For a buffet, I thought this place was pretty good. Food was authentic, the food and spices were prepared the way I remember real Indian food tasting. They had a good selection, even though I had no idea what half of it was. I think next time I may go to an Indian restaurant instead of buffet simply because all the flavors started to meld together and I like just one dish to enjoy, like chicken marsala or curry."
0,The broth is weak and there's a funny taste in the meatballs. The one on rainbow used to be one of my favorites. The food quality and flavor have really slipped with the expansion. Much better Pho one block either way.
2,"well i wanted a place at center strip. would i have gone for the flamingo for a little more money, knowing what i know now? yes.\n\nbut... hey, can't complain. it was a little shoddy, a little dirty, and totally just fine. we had a balcony! which my sister's suite at the mirage did NOT! so there.\n\nthe buffet was fine. nothing to write home about, but so far no food-borne illness, which i'm all about.\n\nso yes, it may not be much of a step up from the motel 6, but it is a step. a good deal at center strip. and if you're spending too much time in your room you're doing something wrong anyway!"
0,"I ordered from here out of desperation for delivery.  I ordered Pot Stickers (the only good thing) Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken.  The beef had large veins of grizzle running down almost every bite.  The breaded chicken was so tough I couldn't finish it.  It was as if they took some frozen, breaded chicken out of a freezer from months of sitting and microwaved it on high until it was over cooked.  I am writing this at 4:24 am because I can't sleep due to the queasiness in my stomach that has lasted roughly 8 hours.  Being a slave to the limited delivery in the Charlotte region certainly takes it's toll."
4,"From where I live I have to drive across town if I crave Poke. Low and behold there is a store right up the street from me. The flavor was not only awesome, but I have been craving to go back ever since.\n   Very modest looking store, but don't judge by that. The food is awesome and the prices are good.\n   Parking can be confusing. Just park across the street and carefully cross over to avoid a possible ticket.\n    I know where i'm getting lunch today."
3,The restaurant was full of Mexican customers! Need I say more
4,"Ferreira is one of the most reliably good restaurants in downtown Montreal. The fish is always fresh, perfectly prepared and wonderfully presented. The wait staff is experienced and provide consistently excellent service.  I've never been disappointed eating here. The only challenge is deciding what to order. When the waiter arrives at your table he will list all the fish available that day and it seems that ever time I hear something I think \""yes that sounds great I'll have that\"" and then I hear the next thing on the list and I think the same thing. By the time we arrive at the end I have to ask the waiter to start again because there were so many things I wanted I can't remember the first ones that were mentioned. \n\nDon't forget to save a little room for a pastel de nata, a Portuguese tart."
3,This is a really nice hotel.  Great gym.  Great pools (specifically the Bamboo Pool - as I consider myself an adult - get there before 11 is you want a seat). Great casino floor.  Lots of fun stuff to look at - yes.  Everything about this place is really nicely done.  We were in a Terrace Studio.  We've been in a lot of nice hotels - but this is my new favorite.  Tons of space in all rooms.  It really felt like home away from home.  And the bed was the best hotel bed I've been in in a long time - better than the Ws and the St. Regis.  I haven't slept that well away from home in a long time - almost so much so that I wanted to stay another night.  We will be back.
4,"This is a great hotel, and definitely one of the best I've stayed at in Las Vegas. I can't speak to the pricing as I booked it on points, but they offered us excellent service as Marriott Platinum Elite members, and both of our rooms were top-notch. This review will mainly focus on the Terrace One Bedroom experience.\n\nThe hotel itself has endless amenities, and I will not list them here as they have a website for that, but suffice it to say that you'll never run out of things to do even if you never leave the hotel. The lobby is actually really cool, with giant TV-tiled columns featuring animated designs. The Terrace One Bedroom, as you can see from the photo, is huge and very well-appointed. Not seen in the photo is the massive bathroom with shower, hot tub, and great views of the Strip.\n\nIt's very accessible from the Strip via the casino and it's super easy to get around for drinks, food, or gaming. Just don't accidentally leave from the side entrance, or you'll get stuck off of the main walkway with no way back on other than hopping a fence.\n\nGreat hotel, and I'd stay again in a heartbeat."
0,"Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. \nThey are an AWFUL company with a MARGINAL, overpriced product and what appears to be way too close to a monopoly on the Valley cable market.\n\nI agree with every Poster's experience. \n\nRecently I was severely overcharged via an \""AutoPay\"" checking account transaction. Literally they dipped-in and removed nearly DOUBLE the amount they should have! To add insult to injury, they made the unilateral, ignorant decision to KEEP/credit my cash rather than immediately return the amount to my checking account.  \n\nIt cost me a tremendous amount of time in repeated phone calls, terrible stress, and skimping on GROCERIES for the week it took them to fix their error!!\nDISGUSTING.\n\nAnd as warning - truly do not ever enroll in AutoPay!!  \n\nThe Banks consider it \""At your own risk\"" - and Cox apparently knows this:  they haphazardly commit egregious errors in which they grossly OVERPAY themselves \""by mistake.\""   Additionally, the billing cycles starts 60 minutes after the last one,  which  means you're ALWAYS in a billing-cycle and can NEVER REMOVE Auto-Pay! I had to shut-down my whole Visa/Debit Card - that's what Shiesters they are!!! \n\nI'm just about ready to make the leap to Dish.\nCan't wait. \nBye from me, Cox."
4,"Love this place!  Reasons to give them a try:  friendly service, precision manicure and pedicure, great prices.  I've been here numerous times since and have been equally satisfied after each visit."
1,"This review is based on the service I had for my pick-up. Mind you my phone had died so I didn't get the first message that they were running late but after the 2nd and 3rd time I called to find out where they were and to hear that they were still \""a couple of minutes away\"" was truly maddening. They were more than 20 minutes late by the time I took off to get on the shuttle to the airport,I don't know when they came to pick up there equipment because I left it at the front of the rental center. If you know that someone has a flight to catch you make sure that you are there to pick up your items on time. I had to run to make my flight with my 4.5 month old in tow, let me tell you not an easy feat. The stress was ridiculous all caused by this company that I will never use again."
4,"Jonathon Bridges, you are an amazing taxi driver. Thank you so much for your service on 11/22/14. He was attentive, giving us useful information around the strip. He even asked us before we hopped out of the taxi if there was anything else he could help us with. He was sooo nice! I can't thank him enough! If you are calling for a cab for this company, ask for Jonathon Bridges. Trust me.. we all know how typical cab drivers are in Vegas especially.. he is different! TRUST ME!"
1,"I am so sad to write a bad review for this place. I was so excited to try this place. The staff was very nice and friendly and fast. However the food was a different experience. The chips are tasty, the salsa and \""hot\"" salsa tasted like ketchup. It was pretty bad. I went with the Pollo Rico. The chicken was so awfully dry I used the ketchup I mean salsa to help it out. Even then it turned into tomato soup. I asked for more hot salsa the waitress told me they have habanero salsa. I asked for some of that....it was ok. The refried beans so so hot however so so bland. They absolutely had no taste. My son was not a fan of his food either....The place it's self is beautiful and they do have a great atmosphere. I will try one more time but after that $20.00 for mexican food between my son and I is not worth it.....sorry =("
3,"I live in such close proximity to Bellitalia that it's just silly last night was my first visit. However, it won't be my last because YUM!!!  It's a cute little hole in the wall with lots of character. Upon walking in, the aromas alone made me really glad to be there.  Our server was lovely and attentive and had great suggestions whenever we asked. The prices are reasonable and the portions are quite generous.\n\nI ordered the carbonara (it came with garlic bread) and my friend got a pizza. The carbonara was wonderful! Everything about it screamed homemade. And the bacon........the bacon was perfection and just the right amount too.  It wasn't at all a heavy dish like an Alfredo. I had some left over to take home, thank goodness (even thought I wanted to eat the entire bowl). The garlic bread was your basic garlic bread - nothing special, but it sufficed.\n\nMy only wish was that the pasta had been fresh, but honestly, the dish was super delicious regardless and it's something I would totally order again.  My friend really enjoyed her pizza as well. She loves their chocolate cake too, but they were all out, which in retrospect is probably a good sign with it being so popular.\nGive Bellitalia a try. We're really glad we did!"
4,Such a beautiful attraction.  I love taking photos in front of this fountain.  BEST FREE SHOW IN VEGAS!\n\nTIP: There are a few restaurants you can dine at while watching the show (this isn't free though...lol)
2,"Arrived to Encore around 1am, there was a short line. Paid $20 to get in. It was hella packed inside. Some fatty stepped on my toe and I had to shove him because he didn't even notice. Stupid British accent guy. Get a hint fool. We spent most of our time outside near the pool. There was a nice view of the hotel and pool. There was a girl break dancing in a mini skirt= free show. Nice place, music was ok for the most part, and unfortunately the crowd was not too pretty that night."
1,"Had to wait 25 minutes to eat, which isn't a big deal, but my girlfriend and I were forgot about and skipped multiple times. Also the hostess had an attitude about it... We were sat with no silver wear. How am I supposed to eat my food, man? Good pizza, but a D- for the customer service. I'm sure there's a BJs somewhere else in town that can do you better."
0,"We ordered 4AYCE sushi buffets on a Friday evening for 90. I received a coupon in the mail, Buy 3 buffets, get 1 free.\n\n- Wonderful welcome. Nice smiles and quick to order drinks. \n- We got there at 6. As it got towards 630 - 7ish, service fell apart big time.\n- When you enter, it will say SERVER WANTED! What they need are more EFFICIENT SERVERS. \n- Servers can't spell! I had to spell out LASAGNA for her. It literally took 1min. Others also, Jones roll...ect..\n- Our orders NOT going to our table. I saw my hamachi nigiri being handed off to another table. It wasn't just that, it happened on 2 other occasions.\n- We ordered UDON, and our ICE CREAM came first. WTF...no more udon. CANCEL\n- Servers look so CONFUSED. we had ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD to OBSERVE their every move bc there was NO FOOD on our table. \""UHH, WHAT TABLE? 7! 7! no, 9! HUH?\"" LOL. you can see the sushi chef popping a blood vessel. \n- BTW, only one sushi chef! ONE!? WTF. the other guy was probably the sous chef.\n- We had quite a bit of sushi rolls. In general, all I can say that they tasted SOGGY! they DRENCH their sushi in this spicy sauce. it makes it worse..ughh FAIL\n- Salmon skin roll is good. WIN\n- This establishment is going down...that coupon wasn't even worth it. \n- AVOID.."
3,Yummy!!  Offered to let us take some peanuts to go.\n\nThe soda machines are awesome with 200 different types of soda combinations.  One of the soda machines broke while we were there so took a little longer to wait for the other machine.
1,"i came here to eat a few times since the review and a lot of my friends told me that this place was good.  First I tried the hawaiian side which was not bad, but it wasn't great.  The Food I must say lacked flavor.  I ate the Mochiko Chicken and the Beef stew and they could use more flavor in the dishes.  It was pretty bland. \n\nA few days later I decided to try the Sushi side and again it wasn't great but not bad.  the Rice was overcooked and they did not use enough sugar in their sushi rice vinegar which made it a little bitter.  and anyone who is a lover of great sushi knows the rice is the most important ingredient to sushi not the fish.  oh by the way the salmon was really bland.  \n\nI decided to take home some baked goods home so I can eat it after at home..  I got some Malasadas, a custard pie and guava cake..\nI took it home and decided that i couldn't wait and ate them immidiately.  i'm sorry but the malasadas was hard as a rock.  Not fluffy at all.  The custard pie was good except the crust was too salty.  and the cake was good also but the cake part was very dry.  \n\nIt seems that they do not have any quality check going on at this restaurant.  or they just don't care."
0,"Wow, this place sucks. While waiting for our table, we were repeatedly ignored by the bartender. We must have appeared too we'll groomed in contrast to the rest of the patronage. \n\nWe had a party of 8. After all the food was dumped on the table, the W. Va. hick that was serving us came over to me and said, \""you must not have ordered\"", which I certainly did because, that day, I had only eaten an apple and I was starving.  I do love it when I am assigned blame for a service mistake by my waitress.  \n\nSo, at that point, I decided to forgo a meal and just have tequila - to kill the pain of listening to the insolent and aggressively poor-performing waitress and to help me better assess next steps for the evening. I ordered a shot for me and the guy next to me. She asked if I wanted salt and a lime. I said no. The shots came with salt and a lime.  Worse, I think the \""shots\"" may have been premixed margaritas without ice.  They were certainly not the Cuervo that we had requested. So, I asked for two Patron shots, which were just what the doctor ordered. \n\nAfter action assessment in brief - worst service I have had in years, maybe ever - can't even get tequila right - horrible patronage (could have been some LA5 gang members in there) - can't assess food because I was never given any, but chips were ok. \n\nRecommendation - 1) don't go - 2) if you have to go, order a shot of Patron immediately - 3) make sure you get some food \n\nThe combination of food and Patron will dull the pain."
0,Such a horrible experience...the food was horrible...the owner is a jerk...and the cops were even present when the owner started some sort of a scene outside. I would never return.
4,I was tired of being fat and knew I had to make a change....nothing had worked before but with the help of the dedicated staff I was able to lose 50+ pounds and keep it off. Chachi was there to give me support when I needed it and help to overcome plateaus....I owe the new me to them and I am forever thankful!!!! I highly recommend anyone looking to make a life change go  and talk to Chachi....he will put u on the right path!
0,"Stand up live posted they would contact me on Facebook regarding not allowing me in with a valid ticket, purchased from their window \nThey blocked me instead \nWhat a great business nice \nPoor service poorly ran very upsetting to deal with !!! Stay away from this venue"
0,This was the most disgusting buffet I've ever experienced. I'm actually sick in my room from this place and I hardly are anything. Nothing was fresh. Everything probably came out of a microwave. \nTerrible brunch.
2,"My wife and my daughter and I gave Nan & Byron's a try for their Sunday Brunch buffet. Nice selection with a few of the usual items - scrambled eggs, sausage links, bacon, biscuits, grits - and a few that were a bit more unusual including a huge tray of oysters, large shrimp, meatloaf squares and a good few things made with sweet potatoes.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the shrimp (with a New Orleans remoulade, but would have preferred a classic cocktail sauce) and the sweet potato au gratin. Sliced salmon was good too, but I didn't really feel like waiting for the toaster to toast.\n\nService was okay with a waiter who refilled Diet Coke often but coffee not as much. I think he was maybe disappointed that we didn't go all in for the refillable mimosas or bloody marys. We're not all booze drinkers, ya know?\n\nParking's challenging with a small lot but there are some spots to be found on the street."
1,Cool Environment.  Expensive Food. Rude Staff.
4,"It is unfortunate that Custom Built Pizza will be closing by the end of the month. It is a great concept. You pick the toppings you want on your pizza and they build it right in front of you. Then they pop it in the oven and in a few minutes, you have a pizza, custom built to your preferences. The staff is very friendly and make you feel like family. We spoke briefly to the owner who expressed a desire to re-open at a new location. I hope he does."
2,"I was searching for a place that served cheese curds last night and Culvers popped up as being the \""highest ranking\"" place with them. Do NOT go here for the cheese curds!! Especially if you've ever had good ones at San Tan Flats, A&W or even Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't like the breading they put on them here - they tasted more like a bad mozzarella stick than a curd. Not a fan.\n\nI did like my burger. Fries were OK - not my favorite and I don't think I'd get them again. My husband's chicken strips were good - just pricey! I also liked how their place is set up. They have an area to order (with a HUGE) menu, and then a separate dining area. It makes it feel more like a sit down restaurant then fast food which is nice.\n\nThe custard was SO good!! I got the flavor of the day (toffee pecan) and I'd come back just for it again!! \n\nBe sure to sign up for their e-mail and text club. I got a BOGO deal and a free scoop of ice cream off their yelp check in offer too! Made it under $18 for the 3 of us."
3,"It not often get my Jamba Juice in. Mostly cause not one really near my side of town and would rather go for coffee if going too relax with drink do some reading on my day off. Ever so often got too step outside the box and go crazy get your guilty pleasures in life. I went for strawberry smoothies with favorite booster or add on whey protein. It same awesome tasting fruit smoothie had who knows the last time. \n\nThe location I believe like most of the other ones usually coffee bean and tea literally attached next too it. This location no difference if smoothies not cup of tea could walk over and get some coffee. Not much comes too food selection here but then again who really comes too Jamba for like snack?? The store is really clean with cozy spot in the corner that could relax and get some reading in. Or if want more bar stool seating long counter up front can hang out. Service was fantastic. No one in the store. Still both gentlemen behind the counter was attentive, friendly, and great service."
4,"I have tried just about every buffet on the strip and this one is my personal favorite. However, depending on your tastes, you might like others better. I am crazy about quality seafood, sushi, salad, and crab legs.  Its the only buffet on the strip that offers sashimi poke, and steak tartar at less than $50. \nHowever, if you don't do sushi and prefer comfort foods with a different twist, this might not be the place for you. You can also find better deserts elsewhere.\nThat being said, I still feel that Bellagio has the best food at the best value in Vegas."
1,"Its okay, but it was just ok.  \n\nThere's a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard.  We were expecting that would be for the table.\n\nWe started with the polenta and the mozzarella.  The mozzarella was unremarkable, deep friend mozzarella in breading.  Of course it was good, it is fried cheese!  But it was nothing special.  The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious.\n\nThey give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary.\n\nMy friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it.  I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.\n\nOverall I would come here again but maybe I'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana."
4,"Yes I have read some of the other reviews and I must say I think these reviewers may have listened to their GPS  and wound up at the wrong place.\n\nGigi's is the Cowfish of Cupcakes!  LOL (Without the wait of course)\n\nMy wife and I went into our first Gigi's in Nashville and have remembered the experience with such fondness and craving that you can imagine our delight when this store opened up just a little more than a month ago.\n\nIt is one of those places that make you comfortable the moment you walk in.  The smell of the cupcakes, the excitement, no, the anticipation of having one of the cupcakes after seeing the pictures and reading the descriptions online.   Then there they are.  Lining the shelves with names that spur the imagination and make your decision all that much harder to make.  I always start with the wedding cake cupcake.  Moist cake, delicious icing and a flavor that takes over your senses and makes you suddenly realize that you have finished the cupcake while still standing in line looking at the others.  \n\nWith a shy look I realize I haven't yet paid for the first one so I pick out another, yet another great choice by the way, and try to make everyone believe that eating the one and taking the other for the road was the plan all along.\n\nGigi's thank you for coming to Charlotte and Charlotte, you will be thanking them too after the first try.\n\nOne more note:  Please take a look at the other reviews that were given by a Yelper.  The 1 star given in the second review under Gigi's was given by someone who didn't like Gigi's, hates Dean and Deluca but 5 starred the Pancake House.  Please consider the source before deciding.\n\nThanks"
4,"A leg of the Quiznos franchises decided to go their own way and become \""Dad's Deli\"". This store is not one of them, it's still a Quiznos. I admit I'm a Quiznos fanboy, but this one is one of the better stores and it's hidden back in the corner of this shopping center.\n\nThe food here is good and the staff is friendly and fast."
0,"Whatever you do, AVOID HERTZ AT ALL COST AT THIS AIRPORT.\nSince, 2011, I've probably flown into Phoenix 3 or 4 times.  Each and every time I had a reservation and my name wasn't on the Gold marquee when I arrived.  After waiting in line at the GOLD booth, I then had to WAIT for a car.  This rarely happens in any other city.  And, If this is the way they treat a preferred GOLD member, I can only imagine how other non-status customers are treated.  If this were an isolated incident in Phoenix, I could understand.  But, 3 or 4 times in a row is just simply poor management and incompetentence ... and they are not at all apologetic.  Just last week, I almost missed an hour of the meeting because I was waiting 45 minutes for a car.  Ridiculous.\n\nHere's the best part ... they sent me a survey and I have them horrible rankings.  The lowest score on the \""recommend\"" scale.  Do you think anyone bothered to contact me?  NOPE.  :)   Then, a week later, they had the nerve to send me an e-mail asking if I would like to post my comments on various social media sites.  Now that's some really incompetent target marketing if I've ever seen any.  \n\nEven though this is who I my company negotates rates with and is our preferred rental car providor, I'll have to choose a different providor at this airport."
3,"This is a fabulous place to go when you have been induced with medical supplements while undergoing tests! After spending the majority of the day at Mayo Clinic, my girlfriends and I ventured here for some well-needed nourishment. The fasting thing does not work well for me! In my drug induced state, I ate all 6 pickles, yep ate them all and boy were they tasty as ever. And then I ordered a liverwurst sandwich with onions and cheese on rye bread! Really? Yes, really. And it was superb! Let's just say the entire experience is but a blurrrrrrr, but the service was good, fast, and the food amazing. Then I needed some dessert! The fridge is full of lots of goodies. Now that I am coherent again, I just shake my head and help myself to some rugallah every time I pass through the kitchen. OH WELL, I deserve a little reward for all I have been through today! :)"
0,"I was at the same party as Carolyn and Jen E - heyyy ladies!  And yes, it was terrible.  The owners/bartenders/managers (three in one!  tripe threat alert!) lacked any discretion, acted obnoxiously rude, and were total douches - and this was on top of NOT honoring our agreement on drinks, et al.\n\nAt one point they kicked out my friend for calling o/b/m a d*ckhole, which is indeed insulting and slightly out of line, except for the fact that they were, in fact, being huge d*ckholes.  Upon kicking him out, they nearly refused to let him get his jacket in the -15 degree weather - and (get this) said he was welcome back \""any time.\""  WHAT?!!!  Please, o/b/m's of the Tiki Bar - take your meds before coming to work, because you are seriously wacked out.\n\nThere are so many wonderful places in Madison to have a drink - skip this one.  Unless you like showing your hoo-has for water at the end of the night.\n\nI hope it goes out of business with all its shady practices and ludicrous douchebaggery."
2,"I've only been here once because Capitol Chophouse sucked my wallet dry that day.\n\nI had the 18 oz. ribeye, which was juicy and tender. The Capitol chop salad was pretty good too. I have absolutely no complaints about the food itself.\n\nBut I just can't justify coming here. The $$$ sign on Yelp should be changed to $$$$. Capitol Chophouse is definitely a pricey restaurant. I'm assuming it's because rent downtown, and especially within a hotel, is high. For the price you pay, there are surely better options out there. Try Tornado if you haven't already. Costs are more or less the same, but the quality and options are a lot better."
0,"This review is not so much for this location but the parent company, Foodmaker Inc. Headquartered in San Diego, CA. \nSeveral years ago a manager at this location presented me with a special card that had no expiration, and entitled me to free combos, or other types of food. It seemed ironic to receive this gift after a short conversation with the manager,as I'm from San Diego and have been a big fan of Jacks since they were a local San Diego chain. It's almost as if I'm being rewarded for 50 years of brand loyalty. Several months ago this card was taken from me by someone at this location, he informed that their was a mistake, and that he needed to confiscate the card. I reluctantly handed it over, not wishing to cause a problem in the restaurant. I notified Foodmaker via e-mail about this and all they did was send me a form letter back, never contacting me personally. My girlfriend experienced a problem at the A&W next door, and not only did they personally contact her, but sent her 2 \""Be Our Guest\"" cards, allowing her to have 2 free combos at any A&W store. Problem corrected in 8 days! After waiting another month, I again contacted Foodmaker asking for some sort of explanation, again the exact same form letter, with no personal contact. So thanks for nothing Foodmaker, after 50 years I'll be taking my business to A&W and In&Out."
3,"Love how close this place is to my house, love the Californian dreamin chicken sandwich! This place has a friendly staff and is kept clean. I have been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed!!"
3,"You can't beat $5 steak and eggs!  I came here with my dad and bf after a night out.  It was open at 3 AM (no surprise) and not very crowded at all.  We asked for the $5 steak and egg special.  It took about 15 minutes before we got our meal, and the steak was cooked just right and came with 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast.  Everything was delicious and nothing was left behind on the plate.  Best $5 I've ever spent!  The service was pretty good, and the restaurant definitely had a cafe atmosphere to it.  Even though it's a little out of the way from the Strip, I would definitely come here again!"
4,I happened upon this restaurant by accident. I stopped in for a tempura shrimp roll & ended up getting the ALL U CAN EAT. You can't beat this deal. The fish is so FRESH and the VARIETY was more than I ever expected. You have to go. The staff is friendly & very attentive. I personally sit @ the Sushi Bar as opposed to a table. Your Sushi Master is right there @ your service & they make the greatest suggestions. The one price covers everything except your beverage & it truly ALL U CAN EAT.\n\nIf you want great sushi and more for your money......YAMA SUSHI is the place to sit back & enjoy the menu.
3,"I had a buffalo burger, the wife had a salmon burger and the kid had a kid's burger combo. All were rock solid or better. Quick turn around and nice servers. - Update, the kid wanted to go back the next day for lunch and since we were in the area, we obliged. Guess what? Yep, the food was even better...I'd go 4 1/2. Also nice to see that the condiment bar was neat and clean once again even with a crowd. A great place for a burger!"
1,"Sorry Steve! I feel kind of guilty, but I have come here two or three times in the last couple of weeks due to it's somewhat close proximity to my living area..... each time has been worse and worse. I still haven't tried the food, which still looks super good! I did, however, try some different coffee drinks. I tried the mocha coconut iced and the aztec mocha iced. Both were appalling. I could not finish either. The coconut tasted WAY too sweet and a little chemical -ish. The Aztec was okay at first.... but slowly became cloyingly sweet as well.... maybe it's the chocolate they use? It was totally unpleasant. The Barista's have always been nice enough, and the space is nice, but man. The coffee just isn't there....."
1,"While the food here was good, I am just not a fan of the long line, the packed atmosphere, and the tight quarters. Just don't feel like I had any personal space, and made me feel a bit stressed out, and rushed. I would suggest coming here for breakfast, however I highly recommend to avoid the busy hours."

3,"Haq's is a good quality Indian takeaway on Leith Walk which offers great food and pretty fast delivery.  My flatmates and I ordered a curry from here last year and it arrived speedily and at a fairly reasonable price.  We had one their menus put under our door earlier in the year and decided to give them a shot when none of us could be bothered cooking or walking to get a takeaway.  My only complaint of Haq's is that the phone call to order the food was about as strenuous as walking to the nearest Indian probably would have been.  My mate had to repeat just about every detail twice and was literally screaming our address down the phone at the guy.  \nAfter this, however, the food seemed to take no time to arrive and only cost about \u00a38-9 each, including delivery.  I had the chicken Kathmandu which was delicious with good quality meat, but just about blew my head off it was so hot!  I would recommend Haq's for delivery, just practise your elocution prior to the phone call."

2,"Wir buchten online eine Junior Suite f\u00fcr 2 N\u00e4chte. Die Junior Suite war gro\u00df mit K\u00fcche inkl. Ami-K\u00fchlschrank und Herd + Mikro und Marmortisch mit 4 Hockern. gro\u00dfes Bad mit Dusche, Waschmaschine, Schlafzimmer mit Jacuzzi/Whirlpool, Wohnbereich mit rotem Ledersofa. Das Zimmer verf\u00fcgte \u00fcber 2 sehr gro\u00dfe TV, 1 mittlerem und 1 kleinem im Bad. Der TV im Wohnzimmer lie\u00df sich gleichzeitig \u00fcber einen Beamer an die Jalousien der deckenhohen Fenster projizieren.\nWir hatten etwas Pech und hatten im 6. Obergeschoss ein Zimmer nach hinten zum Parkhaus raus. Zudem war es nicht wirklich sauber: Wasserspuren und R\u00e4nder im Bad und Staub auf den Tischen, zudem war alles sehr abgewohnt und zerkratzt. Die moderne Lampe im Wohnzimmer ging erst gar nicht. Das hatten wir uns anders vorgestellt (habe dies \u00fcbrigens beim Checkout reklamiert und man sagte mir, dass das Housekeeping-Personal gewechselt wurde und sich dies erst einspielen m\u00fcsste. F\u00fcr mich aber keine Entschuldigung!)\nDen Whirpool zu bef\u00fcllen dauert \u00fcbrigens rund 2 Std, das Wasser l\u00e4uft sehr langsam. Also Geduld mitbringen.\nDie Waschmaschine (von LG) funktionierte gut, \u00fcbrigens inkl. Trockner\nGelegen ist das Hotel direkt am Planet Hollywood, also unmittelbar am Strip, man geht durch die Mall ca. 10 min, bis man direkt am Strip ist. Empfehlenswert ist das Hotel aus unserer Sicht also nur bedingt: Ausstattung der R\u00e4ume klasse, Sauberkeit nicht gut. Lage unserer Zimmers nicht empfehlenswert  zudem ist das Hotel schon ziemlich abgewohnt. Nochmal w\u00fcrden wir dieses Hotel wohl eher nicht nehmen, f\u00fcr die 2 N\u00e4chte war es aber gerade okay. Da hatten wir schon bessere 3 Sterne-Hotels.\nHatten f\u00fcr die Junior-Suite einen Online-Deal mit 130 Euro/Nacht pro Zimmer und das an einem Wochenende. Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck wie bei allen Hotels in Vegas nicht inbegriffen.\nZu erw\u00e4hnen ist auch, dass es KEIN kostenloses Wifi gibt, diesen Zugang kann man mit einem viel zu teuren Tagespass aber kaufen (Empfehlung: im Dennys oder Starbucks am Strip gibts kostenlos Wifi)"
4,"Stopped by after meeting the owner at Social Media Phoenix Day and he hooked us up with a buy one get one free coupon. Then when we stop by a few days later, he is right there running the place with his dog chillin outside to great us as we walk in. \n\nThis is a great neighborhood fro-yo spot. At a time where it's as easy to find fro-yo as it is to find gas for your car Aloha does what it can to set itself apart with the Hawaiian theme. (Dog outside the store!) The flavors were awesome and the toppings looked fresh. \n\nUnfortunately they are not located in our neighborhood, but they are near my parents place so we hope to be back by again. \n\nProtip: Grab a punch card so you can start earning yourself some free yogurt."
0,"Food was really mediocre, I felt like I was eating at Ihops or Denny's but paying a higher price.  The only reason we came here was the $10/pp coupon from purchasing the Vegas pass.  \n\nWon't recommend this place to anyone because there's plenty of good eats in Vegas"
1,"Applebee's quality food, ridiculously high prices. Just dined here for the first time. Ordered the street corn appetizer, $5 gets you ONE piece of corn, tough pre-frozen corn. Enchilada nachos tasted like canned/frozen typical bar food (think Sysco Systems) and barely fed two people, which seems crazy for the $10 price tag. The ONE redeeming quality was the blood orange margarita, which was delicious, but not good enough to make up for the subpar, overpriced food. Will not be returning."
4,"Came to this location for the first time this afternoon.\n I was impressed ,nice red,white, and black decor.\nFood was about $20.94 ,for 2 Burgers, one fry and one drink.\nWe ate it there,but outside. It was a beautiful day, so good to sit outside.\nThey even provide Peanuts on the table so while you are waiting for your food to be cooked you can enjoy cracking peanuts and eating them.\n Bathrooms were nice and clean, as I went to wash my hands before I ate.\nPlace was clean, even outside.\n\nFood was fantastic!  the bun should be toasted it would not fall apart so easily.\nFree refills on drinks. Their drink machine is very different in looks, but works great!\nFries were fantastic, we were going to get 2 but, the girl working said one was enough for 2 people. It was the regular size and it was enough for 2.\n\nWe enjoyed it and will go back again for sure."
3,"This is another place that has been around these parts for a long time now.\nI have visted it a few times over the years I must say.\nAlways decent. Always very busy, they work hard here.\nThey are always having more people cmoe in. It has got to be tough on them. But, they always smile and they always get everything right.\n\nThis visit I got the Chicken Crepes. I have to say I really like it and I am not a chicken fan at all. Also got some eggs and pancakes. Nice and hot and I really do appreciate that.\nLots of parking. Great location. Right down the street from the airport.\nGod knows we are always going by it for something.\nBathrooms are clean as well. Which is another good thing."
2,"It's a nice place to go to to watch any kind of sports or catch any kind of event on TV. It's just a really nice feel to it because of the environment at P.U.B. It's a really fun place(or I had a lot of fun) because I drank a lot when I came here. They have a beer challenge that you can do where if you finish a pint in 7 seconds, you get it for free which is limited to twice a day. A lot of fun things you can do here and it just puts you in a good mood with all the alcohol going on in the restaurant. \n\nThe food is a bit different though. The food is a bit average but all the food goes quite well with the alcohol(obviously). I would prob come back but I do wish the food tasted better or else it would have been an easy 4 stars. I would recommend people to drop by if you never tried it and do the challenge which I fail...(shh I already had quite a bit before the challenge)"
2,"I love this place. Everytime I come to Scottsdale, I have to visit, a couple of times too  No matter what I try, I'm never disappointed, never!\n\nLast night I had the chimichanga (sp?) and it was delicious!  I felt it could have been shared but it made for a great lunch today."
2,"Emiliano's is just an a-okay in my book.\n\nThe happy hour is great ($4 fishbowl margaritas on Fridays from 4-6) They also have happy hour specials all days of the week. The staff is extremely friendly, seriously! Our server was nice and the manager let us switch tables after we were seated in front of a long table of wasted men discussing/arguing about football. Its moderately priced and the theme inside is cute.\n\n However, I feel like for a Mexican restaurant it's lacking flavor (bland, tasteless, unmemorable). I ordered the Cabo Chicken which is advertised as this chicken dish with a pineapple sauce (it sounded delish) The chicken was barely seasoned at all and had pineapple on top. There was a sauce on the veggies, but it was dark.. I'm not sure in a pineapple glaze/sauce is dark. The rice reminded me of Uncle Bens (I'm eating clean so I can spot pre-packaged food easily now.. It might have been packaged, it might not have been.. who knows) The refried beans were yummy!! Bobby ordered the faita plate. He said it was good, but again could have had better flavor for it being a Mexican restrauant. Honestly it tasted similar to something from Applebees. I'm just saying.\n\nBUT the service is super friendly, the free chips and salsa rock & the drink menu + happy hour is great :) We will come back for drinks and maybe an appetizer."
1,"The wait staff was slow and inattentive; the bone-in rib eye was mediocre at best; the atmosphere was way too loud for a nice sit down dinner.\n\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and had to wait 30 minutes before they gave us a 4-person table for our party of 5. We kept having to flag down wait staff and bus boys passing by because there was always something missing. First there weren't enough place settings, then not enough forks, then not enough plates when we clearly stated the steak was to be shared. After we finished our food it took us 15 minutes before we could flag down someone to bring the check. It was such an underwhelming experience we didn't even ask to see a dessert menu, nor were we offered one.\n\nThe presentation of the seafood tower was great and the seafood was very fresh, which is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1."
3,"BEST Scwerma Sandwich YET in Phx area!!!\nand friendly owner....\nRelaxed, cozy, homemade.\nDefinitely will be back."
0,"Disgusting. If the soup was any more bland it would be water. Here's a hint, use soup bone for flavor, not msg. Service sucked more than at a regular Vietnamese restaurant, which is extremely extremely bad. If you hate your job then quit, or kill yourself. We saw the server on two occasions, when she took our order and when she brought the food out. On both occasions she had a bitchy attitude.\n\nFood: Crap\nService: Crap\nPrices: Crap"
1,"Come here quite often, in my opinion this is probably one of the better Mexican restaurants in town. Prices are a bit high but you get what you pay for. I love the complimentary green salsa as well as the red salsa. Only complaint from me is service. Bartenders are awesome but wait staff, is not always the best. I work as a server as well & I just believe you should always make your guests feel welcomed rather than a nuisance. Our server Dolce (i believe was her name, didn't get a receipt) was extremely rude. My friends and I sat without water for about 20 minutes. we consistently tried to get our servers attention & she just kept walking away from our table as we were trying to order a drink. & then when I finally got frustrated and went to the bar to order my Bloody Mary, she asked me why I didn't order the drink through her! & when I responded saying that I had tried to, several times, she told me I didn't. Whatever, I just kept to myself but when it came to paying we had asked for separate checks & she brought one check & then disappeared for another 15 minutes & then split the checks with the wrong items on each bill. TWICE. I can understand that being confusing had there of been 10 of us or something but there were only 3. It's not that hard. Needless to say, my friends and I got so frustrated that we just paid the bill and then figured out the proper amounts later on. Overall experience... Disappointing, but I will be back nonetheless because the food is good."
2,"Since at the moment I'm the Duke of this place I figured I should review it. To tell the truth the main reason I seem to eat at Magnan's so often is because I can walk there in less then 5 min from my place and I'm kind of lazy.\n\nMagnan's is what I would call an updated tavern. Magnan's has been around for 75 year and used to be a men only establishment (not a strip club). My father brought me here years ago to have dinner and watch a hockey game. Back then Magnan's was decorated the way you would expect an old school tavern would be, lots of dark wood, sports memorabilia and big TV's. Five or six years ago the owners started updating the decor and adding new dishes to the menu to attract the new urban professionals who were moving into the neighborhood. in the summer Magnan's has by far the nicest patio / terasse in the area, with both a covered and open aired section.\n\nThe service here is always quick and efficient, you wont find young inexperienced wait staff. everyone who works here are professional waiters and waitresses with years of experience under their belt. I've always received fast service even on the busiest hockey night. This being said the wait staff aren't always the sunniest of people. I suggest you know what you want when you call your waiter over for your order.\n\nThe food is good, nothing special even if they seem to be known for their roast beef. I usually have the hamburger but I've had the roast beef in the past and I can say the roast is good but the vegetables remind me of the boiled veggies my high school served on Tuesday. I guess this is a throw back to it's working class tavern day but for the price they charge I'd like to see a more varied choice of sides. Magnan's is also renowned for their lobster and oyster festivals held late in the summer and during the fall.\n\nIf you find yourself in Pointe-Saint-Charles and want to have a good meal in an old school tavern with more ambiance then you can shake a stick at on hockey nights Magnan's is a good choice, just keep in mind it's a tavern that charges premium prices."
2,"For a company \""cafe\""teria... this is not a bad place. For its convenience since it's on campus and their daily specials change weekly. The prices are kinda steep but that's the price you pay for convenience and the lack of nearby restaurants that are less than 15 mins away. I've tried their \""home\"" section with their roasted pork sirloin or oven roasted chicken, it's actually edible, not excellent but it's good nonetheless. I sometimes feel at times depending on the time of day, the choices become limited and they really do not accommodate those who have lunch after 1pm. Some soups are alright too mainly their clam chowder and their chicken noodle. They're satisfactory. But the prices are killer but I am accustomed to this since I previously worked at the ASU tempe campus and the prices at the memorial union were quite steep as well. So if you're looking for a place for a quick lunch or something to pick up to bring back to your desk, this is not a bad alternative."
4,Took my daughter and her friend to get their nails and feet done.  The two of them had so much fun picking out what they wanted to do.  They chose ladybugs in a pink flower for the fingernails and ice cream cones for the toes.  She even put on SpongeBob on the TV for them too.  They had so much fun.
2,If Spearmint Rhino and Treasures were siblings then Spearmint Rhino would be Charlie Sheen and Treasures would be Emilio Estevez. Spearmint Rhino is a lot more fun with a lot more going on. Treasures is small and booooooring. Bottle service is a lot cheaper though.
0,Well if anyone deserves ZERO STARS HERE WE ARE!  I have been here twice and had ok meals. This time today was my worst dining experience ever. I ordered an omelette and out comes the server with our food and he was the one who noticed a hair on it. Sent back only to return with another pretty looking omelette with a Hair on top!!! I was so appalled. Can you imagine this happening twice ? My friends were about done with their food when I gave then a 3rd chance. This time we were good but my toast was full of butter which isn't what I ordered. Anyway. They were nice to take it off the bill and my fresh food was good even though everyone else on my table was done eating and just watching me. What awful\nLuck... I still see that hair in my visual mind. Never coming back here again. Sorry for the bad review but it was a horrid experience.
0,this place does not deserve any stars. i had to put one star in order for this review to get posted.\n\nplease beware of door pushers in this hotel!!!\n\nif you decide to stay at this hotel make sure your doors are closed all the way & all your belongings are stored & locked away!! \n\nworse customer service ever!! it's not worth it to stay at hotel where you don't feel safe. please please please do not trust this hotel. you can find better hotels with better security.
0,"This place is still a craphole. Back to Vegas for nationals and they did seem to have a bit more organization, however they were still way under staffed for the amount of people. Skanky Dancers dance on poles right by the poker tables now which was a bit much, the service at the main bar is sooooo slow and unfriendly. The food court still has cheap eats, but seemes to close early most nights. So glad we stayed elsewhere!"
3,"Honestly, I'm upset that I bought two passes from Living Social to go here.  Especially when I go there tonight to find out that it was only a dollar cheaper . . . Anyways.\n\nGo to JumpStreet instead.  It just feels bigger, more open, it's WAY cooler so you aren't dripping sweat in the first two minutes.\n\nThe Pros, I do think you can jump a little higher on their tramps, but they feel like they're maybe just way more worn in.  And the solo jumpers in the front are a lot of fun.\n\nThe Cons, way less jumping room than JumpStreet, and there was a worker standing there who wouldn't let us jump on two of the six tramps for no apparent reason.  No foam pit.  Super warm inside.\n\nGo to JumpStreet.  This place is . . . okay.  Just not quite the same though.\n\n\nFOLLOW UP:\n\nI had a much better experience on my second visit. The trampolines were all open this time, the AC was working much better. The ping pong room was fun for a while too. Overall, very pleased. As the updated stars should reflect."
3,"Even if you're not in the area but want some really good Mexican, you gotta come here. The staff (everyone) was very nice. Very clean inside and outside. Plenty of options for seating, even outside. I had the shrimp tacos and side of sweet plantains. Awesome. I also had the ultimate margarita. Supposedly it had 3 different kinds of tequila, but I didn't even catch a buzz. I complain only because of the price! I mean the drink was really good, especially since I'm not a fan of margarita pre-mix (this was homemade). All in all, this has been the better Mexican I've had so far."
2,"Out this Sunday morning doing a bit of GeoCaching, we decided breakfast was in order so where to go? I-Hop or Denny's ... Ok we decided on local so off to Denny's. Walked in, the place was about half full, greeted right away and seated. Coffee & water came out promptly, placed our order and our food arrived hot within about 5min. Service was great & food was good ...\n\nService: 4 star, our waitress was great, fast & friendly\nAmbiance: 2 stars, casual setting, a bit dated\nCleanliness:  3 stars, appeared clean although lots of water spots on the glasses\nFood: 3 star, food came out hot and well prepared\nPrice: 3 star, fair price's, my wife had a BYO Grand Slam for $6.59 and I had an All American Slam for $8.89"
2,Great sandwiches and great service.  But what's with the no restroom policy?  Isn't it a requirement that a restaurant have a public restroom?  The hand sanitizer thing hanging by the register isn't cutting it folks.
0,"I was here on a Saturday evening around 8 o'clock. Perhaps not the best time to review a cafe/brasserie, however, it wasn't busy so there really wasn't any excuse to my mind as to the poor quality of the food.\n\nI had the cod filet, which as it turns out, wasn't a filet at all. My partner-in-crime had the lamb which I think was sufficiently satisfying. He didn't comment on the quality, so I'm guessing that it wasn't exceptional. My dish however was absolutely horrendous. To start the fish was floating in a layer of olive oil, something that I just don't find appealing. If the oil comes halfway up the fish, I'm not a happy camper. Then, the filet was not a filet. It was a full fish, with massive amounts of bones. I didn't expect bones, and they were everywhere. In the first bite, and I take small bites, I had three bones big enough that I had to remove them. \n\nTo give some credit where credit is due, since I didn't eat the fish, just the grilled-to-mush vegetables that it came with (also schlumping around in oil) we didn't have to pay for the fish. But the waitress made such a big deal out of it that it was incredibly awkward. \n\nAll-in-all? Poor service, poor food, and screaming babies on a Saturday.\n\nLovely, enjoy."
4,Dr Glassman has been a caring and thorough physician. He takes the time to make you feel at ease and important and he always explains everything so I can understand it. His staff is friendly and kind and they always remember my name and make me feel wwlcome. Highly recommend this Doctor to anyone!
0,Stopped in to get help replacing a pendant and sconce that we had bought years ago.  The lady who helped me was not very helpful and seemed bothered to even give me minimum information.  I had a bad experience a year or so ago with customer service here but hoped they might have improved in this area...nope!
0,Over the years I have dined at many cheap low end Chinese buffets. This is easily the worst.  \n\nTheir sign says they have something like 150 (I don't remember exactly) items. I don't see the point of having so many items when stray dogs wouldn't even eat this food.
4,"Love this hotel! Very kid friendly, breakfast was great and economical. Close to many restaurants and right off the freeway for easy access. Very clean and modern. Pool was clean and good size but towels very small."
0,"NEVER COMING BACK! !!! we only came for a oil change and they asked if we wanted a $70 wash/cleaning and we said no. we ended up getting a $30 oil change/wash package... they INSISTED that our car wouldn't start and needed a new battery and would be $120 to replace but we said \""no thanks just jump start it and we'll take our car somewhere else\"". they also said we need another air filter and clean the fuel system.  we said no to all. \n\nafter, we took our car to our family mechanic recharged the battery and our battery was fine! we drove towards scottsdale and noticed our car was high on temperature and popped our hood to find the radiator cap missing which was weird!!! we had to stop at auto zone to buy coolant and another cap. bottom line... our car never had these issues prior to coming to francis and by coincidence they ALL APPEARED during/after the visit! we called the manager and he said they didnt take the cap. \n\nin conclusion, we felt very weird abou the whole experience and that something was NOT RIGHT about how they handled everything! NOT COMING BACK!!!"
4,"Only a 2 time customer so far, but im hooked. Each time I had a different barber, and both times i left happy with the haircut, service, wait time, and price."
0,"Great apps! Elham is a fantastic server, ask for her if you go, but you shouldn't everything else was horrible! Just go next store to DW bistro instead!"
4,"Clean, very tasty, and I love the creativity in the dishes.  Well worth the price and I recommend trying different dishes because with each new dish I try I have not been disappointed."
1,"Let me start by saying, I didn't pay for my meal. I was my father-in-law's new wife's birthday so he paid.\n\nWe sat in the bar initially while waiting for more guests to show up. I figured with a name like \""The Keg\"" they brewed their own beer. Turns out they do not. They only have 4 taps and 2 of those are Bud. \n\nOnce all of the guests arrived we moved into the cramped dining room. I've noticed in other reviews no one has mentioned how incredibly dark it is in this place. It's DARK. My eyes readjusted several times while trying to read the menu. It was also very LOUD. They were playing DUBSTEP all night. That was weird. It's like a steak restaurant named for what should be a brewery with nightclub atmosphere.\n\nThere were 7 of us and they sat us a table fixed for 6 so it was cramped. We moved a few of the wine glasses that were reserved for water off the table just make a little room. Our waiter came back over and put the wine glasses back on our table stating that they have to be there with no further explanation.\n\nThe food was ok. I thought the salad was hoaky, but the blue cheese dressing was AMAZING. We got a little bit of horse radish with our steaks which was INTENSE. I'm a horse radish lover and even I thought it was a little extreme. It was good, but whoa my sinuses are still burning. I thought the steaks were good, but no better than what my dad or father-in-law usually make at home. The only other anomaly was an order of mashed potatoes my wife ordered. They brought out a platter about 16\"" wide with one scoop of potatoes on it. Made the already cramped table even smaller.\n \nIf you plan on having a party of 6 or more expect your bill to be in the realm of $500. No joke. The starting prices of steaks here are $25 just for the meat."
0,"This place is a disaster!  The prices do not reflect the poor quality of the food.  I ordered the rib eye steak and it was ultra thin, gritty, and overcooked and it was topped with a sauce that did not complement the rest of the meal.  The steak was no better than what you would receive at Denny's at 2 AM in the morning.  This place is way over priced and the food flat out sucks.  Todd English needs to re-evaluate the direction of Olives.  I felt this way the first time around and I didn't say anything, but after my second visit to the restaurant I couldn't let my disappointment in the cuisine slide.  The public needs to know that this restaurant is a rip off.   If you want good food go to BOAS or the Stratosphere."
2,"Spicy tuna roll is pretty good, big pieces of tuna, not the usual mayo mix. Nice sushi chefs, good happy hour prices, not a large sushi selection though.  (They did tell me they were in the process of expanding it.)"
3,"This review is only for the outdoor dance club and piano bar.  The outdoor is a regular spot for us, and there is a diverse crowd.  The bartenders are attentive, and the security staff is observant.  The house band on Sunday night was amazing.  \n\nIn regards to the piano bar, it is always fun.  As many of you know, tips get your favorite songs played faster.  The piano players were fun, and they knew ever song that was requested.  The only negative is the price for drinks.  For example, a domestic beer is $8.50.  My tip is sit at one of the machines for a minute, order a drink for free, and then go into the bar."
1,"I have been a member here for 15 years. I have always been disappointed with the locations, they are just not convenient for me.However, I have always been a happy cusotmer. A few weeks ago I had to make a deposit and cash a check. I went to this location and I had never had a bad experience before. I went through the drive-thru and it was about 5-10 minutes before they closed. I placed the checks in the tube with my license. The women seemed annoyed because one check needed an additional signature. I did as she asked and passed it back to her. Then she said she needed a signature for the cash and she sent everything back through the tube. I asked if there was anything else and she said no, so I drove off and went about my business. Later that evening I discovered the women had kept my license. Given we were going out for New Years, I probably needed that! So the next morning we went down to the branch, we were about 20 minutes before they opened. I noticed workers in the windows and went to the door and docked. There were 4 employees, they all ingnored me. I did finally get one person's attention and when I did I jestured and yelled through the doors that I needed to get my license.  He seemed to acknowledge me; but I didn't get a response. So I went back to the car and I got a piece of paper to write the employees a note. When I returned to the door and held it up, the man that looked at me with a blank stare had my license and made a 'one minute' hand gesture. He came over and slipped it through the crack of the door, he wouldn't even open the door or speak to me. \n\nI was highly annoyed, someone could have come to the door and acknowledged me and said they would get the license, but instead they were very rude. I made a trip way out of my way to get something that wasn't returned to me, and an honest mistake I am sure; but at the same time, I am very disappointed in the employees behavior."
3,"i don't know if i would have to do a review for chiptole because everyone already knows how delicious chipotle is.  \n\ni think this particular location is pretty good though.  they are normally generous with the portions and the food is always fresh.  i will forever try to avoid the location by the lv outlet mall on lv blvd - we both found hairs in our food last time we went and they somehow got our burrito bowls soupy.\n\nanyways, yeah - compared to some of the other locations we've tried in vegas, this one is pretty solid!"
2,"This was a little further north than I typically like to be, but considering we got a 2 bedroom condo suite for two nights for a heck of a deal, I can't complain.  We rented a car so it was not a big deal getting around.  It's right across the street from the Old Sahara that was taken down.  It's a hotel resort/timeshare so no casino downstairs.  Quiet for those who prefer it that way.  \n\nThe rooms were spacious and very clean.  The master bedroom had a soaking jacuzzi in the room and a shower had heads in every direction.  Oh yeah... serious massage shower!  I got out of the shower dried off and went back in again. ha ha!  My friends were wondering what I was doing, but yeah it was lovely.\n\nWe had a fully equipped kitchen and a pull out queen bed in the main \""living room\"" so the last morning we just picked up some breakfast from downstairs and ate in the room to recover before heading home.\n\nI can't speak for the pool or gym or other amenities because who goes to Vegas to use that stuff?  Well... I guess the pool, but we spent our pool time at MGM's Wet Republic."
3,"Great place to grab a piece of pizza downtown!  We didn't go into the actual restaurant and order off menu but instead elected to sit at counter and choose slices out of the window (we were starving and can never agree on one pizza topping anyway).  The cooks were nice, the pizza was good and we all left full off our one enormous slice of pie.   Would definitely go back."
2,The burgers are perfectly season that you don't need the condiments. Which is very rare to find. They just need to work on service.
0,I can't even explain in full detail how horrible of a restaurant this is. I've dined at the Javier's in Newport numerous times and always had such a good experience so thought the one in Vegas would be just as nice. The service at Javier's in Las Vegas is the worst I've seen in any restaurant. Not only did the manager Omar try to yell and waive his fingers in my face he was yelling at me telling me the cold shrimp with no seasoning or toppings was what I ordered and forced me to pay he was the rudest person I've ever met. Not only is the manager and staff very rude it took us over an hour to get our check and had to repeatedly get up to ask for it. Apparently at Javier's Las Vegas the customer is not always right. I'm filing a complaint in the am and am going to try to get in touch with the owner. I would never dine at Javier's Las Vegas again and if this isn't dealt with then I will never dine in the Newport location as well. All my friends will be told about this and Javier's Las Vegas will definitely be losing more than a few customers
0,"After talking to my son Kyle, I realized that I had had the same over priced/ under serviced, take no responsibility, horrible experience here.  The owner or manager..whoever came out to speak with me was horribly rude.  He does not seem remotely interested in customer service.  I will never go back, and will make sure that I tell as many people as I can to avoid this place as well."
3,"Must support this shop and stop by whenever i get in town.  Very dope selection with a lot of hype kicks and gear.  I appreciate the staff for being chill and not bothering  when trying to browse.  Get some kicks and   rock'em right,"
1,"I came on a Monday... They were out of veal and steak. My dish was the spicy sausage rigatoni which good, not great. My wife had the shrimp pasta Alfredo... Disappointing! Sauce was plain. Turns out the sauce is already shipped here and they don't add any more spices to it. The shrimp tasted like the store bagged ones. Their bread was delicious. The mozzarella fritti was less than ok.  Staff was welcoming. The reason i gave it a 2 was because my dish was OK but my wife's dish was just not good. The Kraft's macaroni n cheese taste a lot better. Also, they were out of two main meats. Will not come back, unless i don't find a better Italian food. Im from Santa Barbara and have travelled all over the world and the states... By the way, my daughter ordered a pizza, which she says she enjoyed."
2,"Not too shabby for Mexican food.  I've been looking for good Mexican restaurants being that I'm from Southern New Mexico and have been craving authentic Mexican food.\n\nThe chips n' salsa weren't bad at all, nothing special (again this review is coming from someone who KNOWS good Mexican food, but hey its all opinion right?) but they did give you three salsas to dip from.\n\nWe had chicken quesadillas as an appetizer (you have to be a moron to screw up heating two flour tortillas together with cheese and chicken, luckily they weren't).  These were good and I have no complaints.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Mojado Burrito.  The waiter told me this was the most food I could get (hey, I'm 6'7'' and I was dang hungry aight?).  It was smothered in some sort of red sauce.  You could order the burrito with chicken, steak, carnitas (pork), or vegetarian.  I ordered it with pork and my friend ordered it with chicken.  The burrito was very tasty, I ate every last bight.  Overall the food was pretty tasty and actually better than what I expected, the three stars was for the service.  Our waiter was awful.  Our drinks were empty for almost the entire meal.  Looking around the restaurant I noticed the same thing.  \""I'll be right back with some more water\"" means \""Hey, I'm going to go chill in the corner for 10 minutes and then remember to give you a refill.\""  Most people have given this place 4 stars for the food, you have to remember I'm a New Mexican and I know good Mexican food when I taste it =).  \n\nPrices were about $10-15 per plate.  If you are staying in the Hard Rock Casino I would definitely go give this place a try.  This place was a little noisy though and I found it hard to hear my friend talking to me, other than that go get your fix of some pink taco!"
3,"Clancy's might finally be the marquee to stick around this location.  My signage memory only goes as far back as Sunday's, and the one time I went in, I was probably the youngest person in there by 25 years- I wasn't their target demo.\n\nOne-Eyed Dog?  It's fine... but every single time I walked in there, weekday or weekend, there was Karaoke.  I'm all for hatcheting up a song, as I do a fairly awful version of \""Centerfold\"" myself, but I don't want to sing it seven nights a week, and you can only hear \""Goodbye Earl\"" done badly so many times.\n\nClancy's?  It's simple.  It's an Irish pub.  Food is a small notch above typical bar food, and the Nachos were surprisingly effective.  The pizza was reasonable, nothing special.  The burgers- I'm a fan.  Beer selection is decent, staff is more friendly than just about any in Scottsdale.  My friend took issue with his treatment by the ownership the last time there, but that's his cross to bear.  I guess they don't take kindly to Canadian Hockey fans during the Olympics threatening to commandeer the microphone to sing their national anthem.  Now THAT would have been some singing I'd have loved to hear.\n\nIt's a simple Irish Pub with simple bar food.  If you don't feel like an Old Town club but do feel like a drink, you can pull in, park, eat, drink, be treated well at the bar, converse, leave, and do so without any pain, then this is a solid place to do so.  In this area, sometimes simple is better."
1,"This place was dead on a Saturday night at 11 PM. How does that even happen? I only visited the top and bottom floors. The bar itself was rather drab and had no personality. I could care a less that it was more of a \""dive\"" bar, I love dive bars. But this wasn't a dive, it was just boring. The bartender at the top level was cool at first, until he got other customers. Then he started straight-up ignoring us. We asked for our bill 5 times and he continued to serve everyone else ahead of us. Get your flirt on, bro, I'm not mad about that. Just try to serve people in order and we'll be happy campers.\n\nBottom floor had a sweetie bartender named Pam. Liked her. The DJ also threw on some Groove Armada and made me extremely happy. I was drunk and satisfied, but the ambience of the bar was severely lacking, making me not really want to visit again."
0,"Took me a while to write this review, but the time has finally come... DUN DUN DUNNN.\n\nBy far, WORST customer service I have ever received at a restaurant.  I walked in on a Friday night at about 7:30pm after getting my hair done at one of Quarter salons.  All I wanted was to grab a quick bite, since I had to rush to work soon after.  \n\nI approached the counter and waited for one of the many employees behind it to take my order.  I stood there patiently for a few minutes, watching as the servers behind it glanced over and saw me waiting, while they mindlessly polished glasses and did God knows what else.\n\nA few minutes later, my patience was wearing thin and the old \""Good things come to those who wait\"" idiom was not sounding so nice.  A young man finally walks up and boldly asks, \""Have you been helped yet?\""  I responded that I hadn't and he began to take my order.  I told him what I would like and he said that he couldn't put the order in right away, because the girl with access to the system was nowhere to be found.  I was confused.  He suggested, \""I can go ahead and place the order with the kitchen, and we don't know where she is, but she will probably be back in time to take your payment before your burger is ready.\""\n\nI thought this was extremely unprofessional and outrageous, but I was hungry, so I agreed.  Then this boy inquires \""It's to go, right?\""    I responded that I would be eating in.  He pointed me over to the hostess and said that she would seat me if that was the case.  I told him that I just wanted to enjoy a burger at the counter, and that I was in a hurry.  He responded that it was full service.\n\nSo a quick rundown.... employees staring at me instead of taking my order, my order unable to be entered into the system because the girl with access was \""nowhere to be found\"", assuming that this was a carry out order because I was a solo diner, directing me to the hostess to be seated when he could have seated me himself, and refusing to let me eat my burger at the counter because it was \""full service\"" and he probably assumed I wouldn't tip.  I can see why this place is closed.  This is horrendous service... take a hint from FOX Concepts and get your act together, Grimaldi's!!!"
0,Pho broth is no good. Service is no good. There are plenty of other pho places in the area. This one was not worth my time and money.
3,"Located in the Arroyo shopping complex, close to Chipotle this is the place I've been going to to get my eyes checked for the past couple years. The doctor is cool, friendly, and never rushes through the exam. He takes the time to explain things and answer any questions. The rest of the staff is friendly and very helpful. They'll help you find the perfect set of new frames and their selection is fairly extensive. A lot of designer brands and plenty of affordable ones too. Their prices are comparable to other optometrists I've been to. They're also good with kids, so you can bring the whole family down here to get everyone's eyes checked out."
0,"This store needs to hire a professional manager with a customer and employee focused background.  It is clear from the reviews and recent interactions that this store does not value either of its greatest assets.  \n\nMy brother Shovel S. posted his own review of his experience with this store.  He was laying flooring and wanted to rent a floor sander in order to level some rough spots on the concrete before laying hard flooring.  When he asked for this tool from tool rental the employee hooked him up with a floor scraper, the kind of device you would use to remove Kool Deck.  He went home, read the manual and realized it is not the right tool for the job and went back asking to exchange for the right tool.  The tool rental clerk and then an assistant manager were very rude to him and charged him over $100 because he left the store with a tool, even though it was the wrong tool and he didn't/couldn't use it.  As if he is supposed to know what Home Depot's iteration of two such similar tools looks like there at the tool desk all wrapped up.  He was just trying to get a job done on his precious weekend off.  \n\nAfter much argument with the assistant manager who insisted that it was store policy to take his money without providing him the proper tool, he left the store with $109 less dollars than he walked in with and his day wasted.  At this point he made a post to social media and I got involved.\n\nAs a management professional, his story was so appalling that I was compelled to call the corporate number to get to the bottom of why if a tool rental employee gives a customer the wrong tool the customer ends up stuck paying for leaving the store with the employees mistake.  The company does not have this policy in any other department.  I have returned dead plants, half used cleaning products that didn't really work as advertise etc and had no hassle.  Why would an unused rental tool be the subject of such a hard-line policy?\n\nWhile talking to corporate I gave them the store number for the location in Tempe by accident since they are on the same street.  The manager from Tempe called me within half an hour but I realized it was the wrong store.  I called corporate with the correction.\n\nMeanwhile the Tempe manager was quite appalled by what happened and made efforts to get the Laveen manager to make the situation right.  The Tempe manager called my brother to reach out.  The Laveen manager remained silent.  Not a peep.  I originally called corporate because the Laveen assistant manager claimed the hard-line policy on the tool rental was a corporate policy.  According to the Tempe manager this is not true.\n\nI called to let them know that in the age of social media I and 200 of our friends had already seen his post about his experience being robbed and then insulted by the Home Depot manager.  We happened to have 2 birthdays in our friend groups this past week and at both events this experience was openly discussed.  I also told my neighbor across the street who I am close with.  We are big time gardening enthusiasts and we maintain our yards as well as the yards of a couple of elderly and part time resident neighbors on our street just to keep the neighborhood beautiful.  I spent nearly $1000 on plants and pool opening products this week and none of was purchased at HD as a result of this experience.\n\nThe manager at the Laveen store STILL didn't call me or my brother back, despite my brother calling the manager repeatedly and my lodging a formal complaint with corporate and even accidentally getting the Tempe store manager involved!  This is uncalled for.  Every day this unprofessional manager held my brothers money and did not reach out to resolve what should never have been a problem to begin with was another day we talked, the saga continued to unfold on social media and now onto Yelp and the manager continued to not reach out.  \n\nFinally, more than 48 hours later, fed up with being in limbo, having had the Tempe manager offer money out of his own pocket because of how ridiculous the situation was, my brother made a last call to Laveen and was finally able to talk to the manager.   The manager did not call my brother; he had to call and leave messages repeatedly, have corporate leave messages and have the Tempe manager make calls on his behalf and finally get through because of his own efforts.  \n\nThe manager did process a refund of the $109 but the fact that it took 2 days and numerous phone calls and multiple people involved speaks of a highly ineffective manager with employees not even empowered to \""make it right\"".  If you value your project time, shop at Lowe's or Tempe Home Depot.  This store doesn't have its act together and needs to invest in training.  With all of the hassle they put my brother through, leaving him with his project still undone, it is my opinion that they owe him more than just a refund.  If I was the manager he would have gotten a refund and 24 hours with the right tool on me."
2,"The ice cream here is definitely tasted, but I think the ice cream is too melted. It has already melt down to my hand even before I went out of the front yard. I prefer something with more solid texture, but if you like soft ice cream, this is definite the place to go."
3,"This was a great place!. My husband and I love Italian foods and this was really awesome!\n\nWe chose to go here following fellow reviewers and it was the best choice we've made in a while.\n\nMy favorite was their fresh homemade mozzarella, OMG A+++\n\nAnd the sweet sausage was the bomb to say the least.\n\nWe will definitely be buying all our items from here, especially anytime we make our large Italian dinners for special occasions!\n\nAwesome job guys thank you!"
4,Best meal I've ever had by far. We both went with the chefs pre fix menu and wine paring. Its not your typical romantic nice dinner place. Its a bit more hip. \n\nThe service was great and it was nice to see the chefs cooking and plating your dishes. A very cool experience. We sat at the bar seating which I feel is the best spot. You get to really talk about your meal and wines with your server. Think bartender of food and drink. \n\nWe spent 650 for two without too and tax. So 800 out the door. Of course you could eat for less but I think for the experience its best to do the chefs menu.
2,"ive been here 100 times for all types of events and its a great place to eat, drink, and watch sports. I love the parmesaean garlic, teriyaki, and habenero sauces. The monthly beer specials isnt a bad deal for a tall domestic. Fries are also pretty good."
1,"Our server was pretty cranky. We have a large group (8 adults and 5 kids under 4 years of age), which I know can be stressful. But the service was terrible and the food mediocre. There weren't enough table settings (and they never got us any more, so none of the kids had silverware). The only upside is thy the food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly."
1,"The only reason why i give a 2 star is because the girl that took my order was very friendly and so helpful. Great attitude. I think her name was christine. (I could be wrong tho) if it wasn't for her. I wouldn't give any star!   I was half way thru my salad and notice that the chicken was raw in the middle.  Completely raw in the middle! So i went to the lady in the counter that looked like a manger and showed it to her. She looked at me and said: \""wow, i hope you dont get sick!\"" And turned around and left me there.  Very disrespectful! Unprofessional and just plain wrong!"
4,I had the truffle crepe and carrot cake desserts. They were phenomenal!! The store/shop is tiny but a great grab and go treat! A must try!
1,"I have in what this city is known as M-Power with SRP. This is the closest location most near to my home. I normally shop at Frys or Wal- Mart neighborhood market. My reason for not shopping at a store I go to regularly to purchase power???? LINES, Lines,and more Lines. With no self check out machines and 11 people standing in line on a regular day to day basis; I simply dont shop here anymore. \n  Considering the neighborhoods to the West, North, and East are mostly middle to upper middle class. I have no idea why this has such a high crime element hanging around. The panhandling and shoplifting are more common at this location than not.  One thing that may help is not having a dark parking lot. The Parking lot in front of the store is so dark. I will not come here after dark. I hope this review will come to the attention to some corporate big wig that can meet with the property management of this location and clean up the integrity of the Safeway Brand."
1,"Man, the quality of Outback has really gone down since the last time I came here. I hope it was just an off night, but everything seemed to go wrong.  The menu was wrong on several occasions. My husband ordered the Sam Adams on draft. Says it should be a Boston Lager, but the Summer Ale came out. Apparently they were out of Boston Lager on tap but the server didn't tell us and didn't offer anything else. The chicken artichoke flatbread was delicious, but the menu says a \""sprinkling of parmesan cheese\"". The thing was heavily covered in it. I would have asked for light cheese if I'd known it was more like a cheese crisp. I ordered the steak salad medium, it came out medium rare. Also, it didn't say that gorgonzola cheese crumbles came on it, otherwise I would have asked for those to be left off. So unfortunately I had to send it back. The manager was very polite and took the flatbread off our bill, but when he tried to explain that they were out of the Boston Lager beer and that's why we got the Summer Ale, I was a little annoyed. Okay that's fine, it would have just been nice to know that in the beginning. Don't give me excuses. All in all it was a very mediocre service and just not as good as I remember."
0,"They get one star for cleanliness and decor. Aside from that, the service was horrible and they were out of half of the items on the menu."
1,"Total loss, the bread was like wonder bread, the pasta was good but the sauce lacked any flavor and the price for the portion was minuscule. You shouldn't go away hungry from a 23 dollar Italian entree."
3,"So apparently my review was taken down because it wasn't up to standards. So I have decided to write another review that's Yelp worthy.\n\nI've been to The speedway three times, three different years for the Electric Daisy carnival. I went in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Each year has been amazing and the venue is perfect for an event like EDC. The staff was okay every year and we got in and out easily. The traffic the first year was really bad but I think after that year the other two were smooth sailing, well at least for limos. \n\nThe venue has a ton of room for different stages and has cooling rooms which are really important for that desert heat. There are also a lot of food and drink stations if you're hungry during your massive partying.\n\nAll in all, I hope that EDC continues at the Las Vegas motor speedway, but I have retired!"
4,"The cleanest, brightest, best stocked Marshalls this outlet shopper has ever experienced.  It's quiet and organized inside, a big contrast to the Ross next door. Highly recommend if you're on vacay and forgot something at home....Big enough to occupy a beat the heat moment from your trek along the Strip."
4,I am from New York was looking for a good ny style deli found Chompie's figured I'll give it a try they have great matzah ball soup seen man vs food slider challange had to try it they have awesome Jewish sliders with lots of gravy yummmy will be back again
1,"Made reservations for 3 people for the Sunday Morning brunch.  Looking at the reviews you should see a common thread, the food is good if sometimes inconsistent, the service in horrendous.  Not bad, really horrendous, as in stupendously  bad.  Bad in a way you really dont want to use the word bad, it deserves so much worse.\n\nWe showed up at 11:50 for our 12 o'clock reservation we then had the opportunity to stare at the reservation desk for 5 minutes because the woman who was supposed to be the hostess was nowhere to be found.  Finally got sat down as the hostess was talking on the phone while trying to seat us, oh such spectacular manners.  After being sat down bartender came and asked us if we would like drinks.  Explained that we would like the Champagne and Trifle special.  He left our iced tea showed up five minutes later.  Our server took our order of the Sampler Appetizer and brunch items and then wait began...the long long wait.  \n\nAfter waiting 25 minutes no sign of the bartender and someone we hadn't seen before brought out a salad...no sampler platter, but a salad...that no one ordered.  So I'm at 25 minutes no iced tea left, sitting on the patio thinking something to drink might be nice.  My favorite smarmy bartender walks by and I ask him about the champagne ordered almost 30 minutes prior.  \""Well you aren't qualified for that special\"", now let's discount the fact that I spent six years in college so I'm generally able to read simple offers with no assistance.  My friendly bartender obviously was not that intelligent.  Explaining to him the offer and the fact that I did indeed qualify for it I would like it fulfilled he left, as he left I asked to speak to the manager.  7 minutes later out he comes...I of course still dont have the appetizer that was order over 30 minutes  earlier.  I get an apology and an excuse from him, I really wasn't in the mood for either.  The last thing I want to hear is \""Well I just got in\"" a much more acceptable response would have been \""You should not have to deal with these kind of issues when choosing to dine here.  I will make sure that everything is taken care of for you.\""  That could have salvaged the entire meal.\n\nAt this point I just assumed that Mr \""I just got here\"" Manager would make sure everything else was going to be smooth.  I overestimated his ability to run a restaurant.  My wife went without anything to drink for over 10 minutes.  We finally received our food 48 minutes after sitting down.  Not bad if we were ordering something more complex than a filet sandwich with greens or fish and chip sliders.  Of course the side of curry sauce I ordered could not be delivered with my meal.  Instead I waited another 7 minutes for that and they still managed to still charge me an extra dollar for a sauce for my cold fries.\n\nGenerally the theme for this meal was the food was ok, when it was delivered correctly.  The service in case I forgot to mention it....was horrid, I would use a different word that horrid if I could find one that would turn my stomach dealing with the complete incompetence I had to deal with.\n\nIf after reading this you choose to eat at English's Quintessentially Slow Gastro Pub (I stole the \""Quintessentially Slow\"" part from a friend of mine who happens to be a genius) I hope your experience is better than mine because I'm fairly certain it could not be worse.  I forgot the cherry on top of this experience was the Bartender telling me taking care of drinks wasn't his job.\n\nUpdate- ** I have great respect for an organization that states \""Our goal is to provide the kind of unique and genuine sort of personal care and attention that our customers tell stories about\"" That certainly was not my experience on Sunday as reflected in my review.  What also is not stated in that review is the spot note I received from the owner after reading my review.  Too often restaurants are way too quick to offer free drinks or meals to compensate for problems and layer apologies on top of that.  What I have found is sadly lacking is someone willing to take accountability of problems.  In this instance Jacob at English's has risen far above his peers.  Hopefully I will in the future have an opportunity to dine at English's and have an experience that I can \""tell stories about\""  At the least I am now convinced that at least one person at English's understands and has a passion for the food service industry."
0,"My gut said no way to a buffet but I always wanted to see if they kept the awesome bar that was in Tambellini's.  They got rid of the bar and have a very impressive looking buffet set up, in fact if the food was any good it would be an amazing place.  My gut was correct and I will never go back.  This place was horrible.  I don't even know how they can screw up food as bad as they did.  The crabmeat is imitation and I couldn't even get a bite down.  The beef which you cut yourself was as dry as leather from a dead camel in the desert.  The salmon tasted worse than it looked and smelled.  The chicken was edible but I am not sure it was chicken.  Same with the \""pork chops\"", they had a very strange taste.  Yes it is \""all you can eat\"" but my plates went back full as it was \""all I could not eat\"".  I finally scavenged some good mushrooms, some chicken, and added it to the fried rice, lots of salt and I managed to get a plate down.  They advertise Hibachi too, but it is a couple of guys hanging out at a grill waiting to throw whatever you hand them from the mini buffet onto the grill. I must say, the Coke was good and there was plenty of parking.  Confucius say.... no buffet.... stay away. Pretty sure the crawfish come from the crick that runs along Saw Mill Run.  We need a symbol that is not a star at all for this one.  Save yourself!  Run!  Bring back Tambellini's."
0,Another Sprinkler repair Co. that did not show. I finally called Sprinkler Man he was right on time and fixed it fast
1,"On my most recent trip to the Cosmopolitan (which was for a work conference) I had a free night for dinner and was totally on my own so I decided to grab some pizza and a beer for dinner. After a little wandering around I managed to find Secret Pizza's location. It was somewhat of a let down because I didn't really care for their pizza or beer selection. I guess I am not hipster enough for cheap beer in plastic cup. I don't remember exactly what the choices were but it was the mass produced watered down stuff like Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. The pizza itself was pretty greasy and tasted like most (if not all) of the ingredients had come out of a jar or can. Don't get me wrong, it probably would hit the spot after a night clubbing but for a dinner after a long work day it was a big disappointment. On top of that there is not much seating and there were some very loud children playing with the arcade games that are in there. I ended up taking my pizza and plastic cup back to my room and leaving half a slice in the mini fridge when I checked out the next day."
0,Horrible!!!   Don't bother
2,"A group of us (12 adults) were staying at the JW and wanted to have a nice dinner.  I spoke to Aaron Lee (group dining coordinator) and he set up the reservation at the Meritage.  They don't have a private room so we got a corner table.  I had preordered 2 seafood platters, calamari/shrimp , and sweet potato fries.  We arrived and was promptly escorted to our table.  At 8pm on a Tuesday night, they dining room was only at approx 40% capacity.  We were immediately served water and cocktail orders were taken.  Cocktails were a tad pricey at $15.  I tried one of their signature cocktails (pomegranate and whiskey concoction) and thought it was good, just not $15 good.  We ordered some white and red wines as well (fair selection).  The seafood platter was nice.  Oysters were decent.  You have to ask for the drawn butter if you want it with your crab legs and lobster.  I thought that made it better.  People said the calamari and shrimp was over seasoned and I would have to agree.  Fries were just fries.  For my entree, i opted for the prime rib (medium rare) and the rest ordered the rib eye.  I thought my prime rib was cooked perfectly.  I liked the smokiness that was hyped up.  The entrees didn't come with any sides.  We ordered the cream of spinach, mash potatoes, and mushrooms.  The sides were just ok.  I still would prefer Lawry's prime rib and their sides over this.  The rib eyes were good.  We had some issues with the temperature of the rare and medium rare.  The waitress initially came out and made it seem as if we were wrong (\""when you see it in better lighting, you would see that it was cooked properly) but sent it back.  I mentioned to her that rareness is judge not only on color but temperature.  And the steak she brought out was too warm to be called rare.  The chef came out himself to apologize and made sure the new ones were cooked well (and they were).  He also sent out some extra sides.  \nFrom that point on, service was great.  Actually it was great throughout.  We ordered a couple of the desserts. The banana cream pie was awesome but the creme brulee (chocolate) was just ok.  \nMy last complaint was that we had a package with the hotel and was suppose to receive free appitizers and desserts.  I thought the group coordinator would pass this along to the restaurant.  We never got the freebies.  And when I wrote the coordinator about it, I did not get a respone...\nAll in all, this pace was decent and deserves a 3.5 star rating.  It doesn't really stand up to the Flemings, Maestros, or the other high end steakhouse.  But for being on the resort property, not a bad choice."
2,"Hate to say it, but I just didn't love it.   There, I've said it.  After tasting the mushroom risotto appetizers at Yelp's Birthday event, I couldn't wait to come to Herb Box for lunch.\n\nThe restaurant has a nice layout with a dine-in area, a little market, and a patio in between.  We sat inside and started with the market cheese board.  There was only one cheese selection, I expected there to be at least two for some reason, but it was delicious--brie with a caramel-like sauce (fig, I think).  I also had the grilled chicken and sage pesto sandwich with goat cheese and bacon.  It was good, but it wasn't an \""OMG, this is the best sandwich I've ever had moment.\""  I really think serving it warm would bring out the flavors.  Worth $12?  I think not.  Sweet potato chips were a plus!\n\nWhere they really lose points with me was service.  Not terrible, but definitely left a lot to be desired.  I had to ask for utensils and napkins.  Also, she offered a box for half my sandwich and left the room, but came back empty-handed.  Empty hand, empty head.\n\nJust okay for me.  But I might have to have a party for one catered just to get those appetizers again!"
3,"This is a nice discovery on the North Phoenix landscape.  They have a good variety of mediterranean options.  I think everything should be about one dollar cheaper since it's just over the counter service.   However, they use real plates and silverware, which is a definite plus.\n\nThe food is very good.  I eat here all the time during the work day and I'm never disappointed.  I get the soups a lot, which are always good.  The hummus is really good, too.  I'm a fan of the chicken shawarma and shish kabob as well.  The adjoining market is a nice addition and can make the trip more worthwhile.  \n\nI've been very happy with the veggie platters.  I think vegetarians will find plenty of options either with the platters or by building up sides.\n\nI'll continue to frequent this place because I work close by and this is far more interesting than most of the food in the area.  They never let me down."
1,"I really wanted to like Tommy V's -- unfortunately this review will be less than flattering.  I'll begin with what I did like:\n\nThe happy hour drink specials: $5 glasses of wine, $3 beers, and $5 house cocktails from 5-7.  Not bad.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\nThe pizza: The pizza tasted OK, but averaging around $15 per pie - which one hungry adult could easily finish -  was a bit outlandish. The quality was nowhere near that of The Parlor, LGO, or Grimaldi's. At those prices for \""personal\"" pizzas, I'd expect to be wow'd.\n\nThe service: We were surprised to see only one vegetarian pizza on the menu (not including the standard cheese pizza).  When we asked the server if we could substitute veggies for meat on any of the pizzas, he acted like he's never heard this request before -- and he had to ask the chef.  His sanctimonious attitude about substituting artichoke for prosciutto was just odd. And when he finally allowed us to make the substitution, the pizza came out wrong.\n\nWe gave it a shot, but most likely won't be going back."
0,Made reservation because had other engagements. Showed up and waited twenty minutes. They said sorry people who have your table haven't left yet. As if they only have one table. When we informed them of our time constraints. They made no offer to help out. Like the food but not so good at keeping the reservation. And really that's the most important part
2,"There's not anything especially spectacular about this place, but it's must nicer than I thought it would be.  The rooms were renovated recently and the upgrades are apparent.  Very large wooden console built-in to the wall with a desk, drawers, and a flat screen television. In my room on the 18th floor I had a view of the Strip and of the twice daily Sirens show out front (the fireworks were impressive, but sometimes they got a little annoying).\n\nThe casino is very large with tables and slots of every denomination.  I was up quite a bit a few times here (in contrast to not making any money at other casinos) and my Player's Club account is full, so I hope that they'll send more room comps my way.\n\nAs with everything it seems like the small things are always what create the tipping point.  For example, they take pride in being able to provide personal items to guests when needed.  Well, I needed some shaving cream because the TSA threw mine away.  I got two razors instead and when I inquired they said they didn't shaving cream.  Hmm...\n\nThere weren't many places to eat late at night, which struck me as odd considering that I did most of my gambling after midnight and/or just before dawn.  I received comp for the $22 dinner buffet, so I checked it out.  After waiting outside for 10 minutes at 9:00 p.m., I was lead through a dining room that had tables covered in dishes that hadn't  been cleared.  I apparently waited because no one could pick up some plates.  Again, it's the small things.\n\nGreat location on the Strip and the rates are pretty reasonable for everything that they have available.  I don't think I'll be back unless it's free, but if you do pay the bed will be what makes it worth your money... Amazingly soft and comfortable!\n\nOh - and the pool wasn't anything special.  Service was quick, but the chairs are old and the pool is pretty small.  I got a little annoyed whenever the speakers would crackle almost like static on an old FM radio.  It's 2008 and you can buy satellite radio and outdoor speakers. :)"
0,"Great location and interior. Food is noting to write home about , and service is poor.\nThey tout the the Chinatown experience but it's about 2x the china town price . Don't go here if you want the Vegas food and service experience because it will disappoint and leave your pocket book empty for not."
2,"All of UPMC was elated when we got a Starbucks in the hospital. Walk down and back up cardiac hill just for non-cafeteria coffee?? No thank you! The line can get long, but it moves pretty fast. They've got breakfast pastries and sandwiches, little salads and snacks, and a wall of retail. Be warned, though, that this location commonly does not participate in regular Starbucks promotions."
4,"Lime service is on point, but vodka OJ's have to be approved by management. Rules are rules though..."
3,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Upon check in the staff was courteous enough to give us a complimentary upgrade to a lake view room for my fiances birthday. I really liked our view (see picture). We didn't get a map of the property at first so we didn't know where our room was until we asked the bell hop. You're on the 4th floor at the main lobby so just remember that.. The beds were super comfortable and the bathroom soaps were delightful! There are no microwaves in the rooms, heads up but the food from the restaurant is pretty good. We had the pizza, it was delicious and the breakfast buffet was nice. There's an omelette and waffle station that could get a little backed up but it's worth it they're really good!! The servers were very nice as well. The Dominican Server we had.. Jose, I believe is his name? He always seemed to be around with a warm friendly smile. He served us both at the breakfast restaurant and at the pool area. He def stays busy and does a wonderful job at it all he deserves a raise! Please don't make any phone calls from the hotel it's extremely expensive! Overall we enjoyed relaxing at the pool although, I understand it's not summer or anything but the pool closed around 5pm that bummed us out a lil but we loved the water slide! The resort is lovely and the free kayak rentals were fun! I highly recommend this place if you're trying to stay away from the craziness if the strip and relax but also not be to far away to drive to it too. The area is really nice and the free shuttle gets full fast so book ahead in advance! Thanks westin lake Las Vegas for an amazing mini vacation! And for the complimentary bday champagne!"
0,"Do I even have to give a star? In Australia we call this style of dining yum cha.  \n\nFirstly, They say the kitchen closes at 3pm, and we arrived at 2pm. The dim sum cart came around once, then we were told to order from the menu if we wanted more food. The service was SHOCKINGLY BAD, they would ask you a question, and then ignore the answer, only to ask the question again, only to get caught up in a conversation with another server, only to ask the question again.\n\nI can't even be bothered telling you all the other issues here, because I want to clear my head space from people/businesses like this.\n\nNEXT!"
2,"I stayed here one night with a friend recently during the March Madness festivities. The location on the strip is great and overall is a nice hotel. The walk to the elevator and then to our room was a bit of a trek, but not too bad. I'm not sure what my friend paid or booked, but it was a double bed room and had a nice separate shower/ bath tub combo. The view was the backside of the strip so not much to look at. \n\nI had wanted to go to the pool the first day we were there but we had to wait until noon for it to open which was annoying. We waited in the bar outside the elevates and they had $9 mimosa & Bloody Mary specials so not all was lost. We ended up just doing a lap around the pool deck and not staying as the pool was nothing special. \n\nMy biggest complaint was that the helpful old security guard gave me unsolicited directions which ended up having me walk an extra mile through the Bally's construction zone just trying to get back to the strip after he told me about \""a great short cut\"". Never again Wyatt, never again..."
3,"Thanks to the Yelp community, I found Isla, an nice oasis in the madness of Las Vegas. I would come again for sure, if I ever visit come to the Strip again in my entire life.  Guac and chips were fresh and lovely.  Entrees so good.  And I broke my one-margarita rule and ordered a second one.  Service was a little slow but very friendly.  Might have had something to do with the large bachelorette party in the same section.  I do recommend it.  Above average Mexican food! (And I know my Mexican food!)"
2,"There's something fun about walking around a room full of books and I love a good audio book for my daily commute. However, what gets me in here is the wifi. Not the cleanest system for wifi, but its free. When I want to use wifi I'm grateful for the wifi.  I'd be happier if it didn't keep booting me out. That criticism in mind, I'm going to have to go 3 stars, even though I love this place and have spent countless hours here and bought a good number of audio books."
0,"If you're looking for appliances, plumbing supplies, toilets, keep looking!  Pacific Sales has difficult to understand pricing, limited products on display, and long wait times for delivery.  Most ordering is from a catalog that does not have prices.  Do yourself a favor and skip the aggravation that accompanies shopping at Pacific Sales."
4,"We just moved to the neighborhood and we were looking for that new local spot, we were nervous after reading the reviews about slow or bad service.  My wife and I have been several times just for drinks as well as we have brought the whole family for lunch and dinner.  We have not had a bad experience yet!  My guess is some of these reviews may have been when they first opened and were not quite the fine oiled machine of today.  Good food and drink menu with reasonable pricing and specials.  Check this place out!"
1,"In person, the staff can seem friendly or helpful. But over the phone, they don't even bother. They've called me to show up early only to switch doctors on me. The office isn't very clean. I had hoped to never go back, but they wouldn't respond to prescription refill requests and I had to go in person to fix the situation. First they told me I would need to come in and be seen every three months for my refills, but when I began to question this they folded and gave me my prescription. They seem like they want to force you to have as much done as possible to line their pockets with your insurance (hopefully) money. I'm back to hoping I never need to go back."
3,"Tonight I took my girlfriend out to dinner to the Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park. We arrived early and there was no wait. We were quickly seated in a dim lit booth. After searching over the 16 page menu we finally ordered edamame and calamari for appetizers to pick at before our entree arrived. They came out fairly quickly and were great. I ordered the orange chicken and was quite satisfied. My girlfriend ordered shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Both of the meals were largely portioned.  We were too stuffed to order dessert. But I have had their pumpkin pecan cheesecake and it's delicious. Overall, I would return there again and recommend it to anyone seeking a good meal."
2,"I came in this week to grab a quick slice in between meetings. I love pizza - any kind. When I've had a busy schedule at work, I usually come in and grab a slice and sometimes get it cold because I'm moving so quickly.  I was surprised to find your new made to order format.  I was short on time but gave it a try.  \n\nPros: 1) I love that you can get as many toppings as you want for the same price.  That's awesome. 2) Coke products - yay!  great choice. 3) The pizza was really good.  It hit the spot.  \n\nCons: 1) There are no grab and go options. You have to order and wait for it. I went after 1pm but I imagine there is a long line at noon.  It takes a full 5 minutes to cook. I wanted it to go and then I had to wait for them to box up. Seems silly to complain about another minute but I just wanted to go fast. 2) cost - pizza and a drink was over $10.  I usually came in for a slice and a drink for $5. I recommend that you consider some type of cheaper option for the lunch crowd if you are going to make this work.  Maybe a smaller pizza size for $5? I know your audience is not kids but a smaller size would work for that population too.\n\nI'd love to see you make this work because a slice of pizza during the work day is my preference for lunch. I was excited to see a place to get slices when I took this position downtown. \n\nLOVE the coca cola products (I used to go next door for a coke). Big plus!"
4,Great brunch!!  I had a lobster omelette.  We were in a rush and they got our orders out very quickly and were extremely nice.  Will definitely go here again when I'm in the area.
4,"5 stars for the vibes.\n5 stars for the rad chicks running the joint.\n20 stars for the Coyote Oatie ice cream sundae!\n\nStopped in on our way out from the Glendale Chocolate Affair and found heaven in a bowl.  I got the famed Coyote Oatie ice cream sundae and it was facking awesome.  Its basically the best ice cream sundae you've ever had with one of their signature Coyote Oatie cookies all warmed up and on top.  This is the perfect dessert.  When the cookie crumbles into the ice cream and caramel it is awesome.  Loved this little joint in downtown Glendale, loved the ladies running it.  I'd much rather give my money to a local joint like this rather than a CORPORATE Coldstone or Baskin Robbins.  \n\nAlready planning another trip.\n\nMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Went there after the club waiting to get my hands on some wings...after waiting for a table for 30 minutes, we sat down only to find out that they DISCONTINUED THE DAMN 25cent WINGS!!!!  It's $7.99 now for 10 wings and fries, BS.....anyways, it is cheap food price and quality wise.  You get what you pay for.  Waiter messed up the order, but whatever.\n\nAnd if you want wings tossed in butter, get mild...:/"
2,"Oh Lucille. Why do you always disappoint?\n\nI went to Lucille's a couple of times a few years ago. I think it was pretty good the first time. The second time, for some reason, I left with a negative feeling. I remember paying $20 for hardly any food. On the other hand, my coworker paid much less and had way more food.\n\nAnyway, that experience caused me to avoid the place for several years. I finally went back a couple of weeks ago. This time, we all ordered the same thing - the Smoked Beef Brisket & Portabello Sandwich from the lunch menu. This time around, the price was right ($8.95) and the sandwich was delicious and satisfying. The problem now was that the service was incredibly slow. I'm going to chalk it up to being the last week of the year. Fortunately, the company I was with made it not seem that bad, but even the people I was with mentioned how slow it was.\n\nOverall, I think Lucille's is A-OK. It's never been somewhere that pops in my mind as a choice I would make. But at least now, if someone wants to go there, I'm not against it."
0,Had our credit card swiped twice for one bill on one visit and then it happened again a few months later...definitely not going back here.
0,"I am a regular at the good egg. Ray location on mondays and fulton ranch on tuesdays. And when Im in tucson I'll hit the speedway locaton ( Which by far has the best food!) \n So you would think that the food would all be the same since its  franchise, but its not! the ray location food quality is 3-4star, tucson definitely 5star and Fulton ranch is the worst. so bad I refuse to go there even though its walking distance from my house."
2,"Pierogi pizza is amazing!!!! They ran out of traditional pierogis which was a total bummer but then we saw the pizza. It was more satisfying than pierogis on a cold rainy night. The red leaf side salad was tasty but over dressed and didn't come with the blue cheese the menu promised. The special pierogis of the night were not amazing because the butter added in unwelcome sweet flavor to the jalape\u00f1o, cheddar bacon yumminess. The beer was great and the interior of the place is fun. A large brewing system sits on the alter and is  quite beautiful. The reason the place did not get 5 stars is because honestly out service sucked and the fact that they use styrofoam to go containers. The waiter did not greet us, tell us specials or attend to us. At one point when we were finished (napkins on plates) for a few minutes waiting for the check he was in the corner watching the game."
4,The cinnapies are sooo yum!  And their $5 pizzas are great for last minute potlucks.  Every time I've ordered from them my pizza was always fresh and generous with toppings.  If I had to mention a downside it's that they don't take Discover and I like when business take all forms of payment.  But that still isn't enough to mark them down.
0,"Really wanted this to be good.....very dissatisfied.  Fish was dry, food was, in general not to the caliber I would have wanted from what they are representing.  Service was fair.  Good idea but for us, a miss."
2,"Quel beau choix de poutines! On en retrouve au g\u00e9n\u00e9ral tao, au steak au poivre, au boeuf \u00e0 la s\u00e9choinaise, etc... Les frites sont bonnes et recouverte de juste assez de sauce. \n\nMa suggestion: la sp\u00e9ciale No\u00ebl \u00e0 la tourti\u00e8re avec ketchup aux fruits et betteraves. le m\u00e9lange des saveurs est parfait. \n\nPetit conseil: La petite est amplement suffisante! Le bol a l'air petit \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, mais avec la montagne de garniture servie sur le dessus, c'est bien assez! \n\nLa salade de chou vaut \u00e9galement la peine.

0,I am really disappointed overall-overpriced for portion of chips which looked like soggy potatoes (not very clean either-they should change the fryers more often). I have been ask to pay extra for mayo?! Really????
0,"The dog volunteers and front desk were so friendly.  The volunteers in kitty city were another story.  I've never had people make me feel like less than a human being than I did there.  A human being who came ready to adopt this afternoon had one of the cat volunteers given me the time of day.  I'm really sad cause I am a cat lover and our cat died in November.  The dog people were so nice I thought for sure kitty city would be the same.  I fell in love with a kitten in minutes but the attendants gave me either funny looks or completely ignored me for a family that was still looking around.  The service here broke my heart.  They are doing such a great service for animals, but I didnt feel welcome.  I'll have to find someplace else to go."
1,"I am from Missouri, the land of Steak 'N Shake.  I was excited when they announced plans to open a restaurant in Vegas... I thought it would be a taste of home.  However, this is NO real Steak 'N Shake.  The food and service is very inconsistent.  I keep coming back and hoping it will be better, but sadly, it isn't.  Cold burgers and fries, watery shakes, rude waitresses..."
4,"I've been enjoying their food since 2004 and it still until this day is my favorite Chinese food place. I'm not really big on Chinese food actually...I'm veeeery skeptical of any place new. With that being said House of Yang more than exceeds my expectations. \n\nFirst the staff is super friendly. Usually when I go in and pick up a dinner order the same guy is working the counter; I want to say he's the owner or maybe part owner? He's very friendly and engaging (ok he's kind of handsome to boot, I'm just saying) and doesn't mind when we substitute egg rolls for the soup in the dinner combos.  That's an extra plus right there. \n\nNow for the food...what can I say, nothing is bad that I've tried on this menu. The egg rolls are extra crispy, my go to is tangerine beef and man is it good. Volcano beef is also delicious, orange chicken, cashew chicken, sweet and sour pork....I can go on and on here peeps but you get the idea - it's delicious! \n\nThey do deliver; unfortunately I'm just outside their delivery range or else I'd eat there way too much. Anytime I'm craving it or I'm close we'll head there to pick up food. You'll be glad you did too! You're welcome!!"
1,"This place was terrifying to me.  I did not feel welcome whatsoever.  I came in and it took a pretty damn long time for me to place a drink order and then it took even longer to get the bartender to process my payment so I could get the hell out of there.\n\nThe bartender wasn't rude to us at all.  Just indifferent.  I still felt like she hated me, though, and did a good job of masking it.  If a magical being granted her the ability to do something without any negative effects of it while I was at that bar, she would have chosen to put a cigarette out on my face.\n\nThe two gentleman sitting at the bar next to me both sounded like Billy Bob Thornton from Slingblade and kept saying the words, \""faggot\"" \""cocksucker\"" and \""brown chick.\""  I was wearing purple shorts and a tanktop and I was with my Mexican girlfriend so it's kind of impossible to think they weren't talking about us.  Who knows, though, they had rotten hillbilly teeth and I couldn't understand much else that they said.\n\nStill, man, my drink was stiff and cheap and I got kind of drunk off of one.  If this place was dead I'd like it much more.  I mostly just am terrified of the clientele.  I liked the booze and I was okay with the bartender who was slow to take my order and may have or may not have wanted to burn my face with a cigarette."
3,"Since being pregnant I've had a craving for none other than pizza. Pizza in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. Every meal. Pizza. Needless to say, I did drive from Henderson to Summerlin to FINALLY try Dom DeMarco's.\n\nBeautiful restaurant in a great Summerlin location. Excellent service. \n\nDom DeMarco's actually has the recipe to DiFara's pizza, consistently rated best of Brooklyn, and it was such a treat to have a Brooklyn favorite right here in Vegas. The sicilian pie has the thickest, flakiest most delicious crust. You just don't find a square pie like that ANYWHERE else in town. \n\nHeard a rumor that they may be pulling the trigger on a Green Valley location! Please do! I've been craving their square pizza pie a while now but going to Summerlin for pizza seems almost as inconvenient as going to Brooklyn."
1,"Every time I play here something makes me angry. Today was slowness. Usually it's service and miserable people but today all staff I encountered were very nice. We played 13 holes in 3 hours and waited at least 5 minutes if not more per hole. Don't go here if you want to play a quick round and don't use the vending machine on the 4th hole. Wasted half my day waiting so we just left. I will say the greens were in excellent shape which is why I gave 2 stars not 1! I am a self proclaimed golf snob so I may be a little bit dramatic but when I pay $30 and barely get through half a round, this is what I have a problem with."
3,"Another successful transplant from NYC, this place is great.  Spendy, trendy, and a little confusing menu wise if you have a big group like we did.  we had a great waiter that helped us with our order and nobody left disappointed or un-full.  The place is loud and full of energy and beautiful people.\n\nAsk for help with the menu if theres a group.  If youre a couple youre golden.  So many things to try, you could eat here 100 times.\n\nNo complaints at all."
4,"Food tastes incredibly fresh. Got the drunken noodle dish - it was a really large portion. Service is efficient. They have no problems accommodating patrons and can make your dish vegan if you ask them.\nBTW, unless you really don't care about costs, don't be fooled by the nonchalant offer of an alternative for a drink... my friend said yes to the coconut milk/water and then was shocked to see 12$ on the bill later on. ^^"
0,"Jollibee, why'd you have to go and break my heart like that?\n\nI've always had a special place in my belly for this one of a kind Filipino fried chicken and fast food establishment, until yesterday. I haven't been here for a good 5 years...oh how much things have changed. \n\nFirst offense: an army of chicken fried in advance and sitting on heat racks. The chicken was soggy, slimy, very fatty and the crisp factor was out of the door. That's a fried chicken no no! Ugh\n\nSecond offense: 2 sausages in my sweet spaghetti. What happened to the promised \""meatiest, cheesiest, spaghettiest?\"" This used to be my favorite item on the menu too! Double ugh \n\nThird offense: that burger steak combo meal was so bad, I really couldn't figure out if they wanted it to taste like a boot or what! Triple ugh\n\nMy beloved quirky Filipino fried chicken chain went down the drain. Cutting corners is what looses customers! Ugh to the ugh!"
3,Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was good but don't order a side of beans...not very good and weren't worth the money.  Wait staff was great and food came out quickly. Would definitely go back.
4,"We went here last weekend after craving some burgers. The menu looked a little confusing, mainly bc the place is so small and it seems like there are so many options. We each got a build-a-burger where you can choose two toppings for free. I got mushrooms and bacon and my boyfriend got green chiles and bacon. We also got chili fries and a chocolate milk shake. It was soooo good!\n\nThere's this place in Berkeley back home called Nation's that has awesome burgers as well, and it's bigger. But it's more expensive and you can't get the toppings for the price at Lenny's. My meal with reg fries and  a large drink with a burger and my toppings was only $5.99! It was very tasty and we were stuffed. The chili fries were better than Nation's too bc it had more chunks of meat. I also liked that their fries had this yummy paprika garlic salt on it, it was so good!"
0,"Where do I start?  If you know anything about music and what a DJ should actually sound like, stay far far away.\n\nI went here to see Craze and never thought I could be so disappointed.  The opening DJ was painful to listen to.  Even with a serato, he couldn't beat match to save his life.  He also couldn't get his levels right, come up with a decent track selection, or scratch (um, you're opening for Craze... stop embarrassing yourself).  The crowd still ate it up.  I'm not normally very judgmental, but this crowd was the lowest of the low and not what you would expect in a Vegas club.  The go-go dancers were ok with the exception of one - she had no clue what she was doing.  The dancers are supposed to set the tone for the crowd, so I guess she fit in perfectly.  When Craze went on, he totally played for this crappy crowd.  I had to book it out of there.  It was a very disheartening experience.\n\nI wish I could give this place zero stars.  The staff was nice, so I guess that's how they earned their star."
2,Crepes station is top notch. Seafood was okay.  Kind of worn down in the last 5 years. A deep cleaning would be great for this whole seating area. Probibly backstage too.
4,Great shop.  I can't 89 agile why anybody would complain about speed of service.  Slow is better when doing mods.  This ain't jiffy lube.
1,"I'm a frequent visitor to Kabuki, mostly for work lunches during the week.  Today (Saturday) I decided to treat my wife and kids to sushi!  I'm not sure if I'm tainted by the larger and quicker lunch staff, but service was absolutely atrocious.  Our server, Andy, was covering what appeared to be 4-5 tables.  His priorities, however, were more targeted towards complaining to fellow waiters about having to work on such a nice day and discussing weekend plans with the hostess.  To give you an idea on what I mean by \""bad service,\"" our appetizers and salad (that comes with the special) came after we were done with our sushi rolls, drinks were not filled, and it took him approx 20 min to pick up my card and check after dropping it off.  It's too bad they couldn't find anybody to work that wants to work!  Buyer beware, bad service, \""okay\"" food."
0,You asked me to email to further discuss my experience at your hotel about 3 weeks ago . I actually emailed you on two occasions. I have yet to get an email back . Customer service yet has been up to par with my whole experience with the hotel. This is the reason why I made a complaint the first time . If I could give less than 1 star I would.
0,"The seats in the theater are uncomfortable and broken. They squeak and squeal if you even think about shifting your weight. Also, the sound from the other theaters bleeds through really bad. I'm currently hearing someone singing two theaters down, an ominous bass rumble in the next theater, and static/white noise from the speakers in the theater I'm in. Way subpar experience compared to Harkins. It's worth the drive to go to the Harkins at Az Mills rather than coming to this crap hole for the 'convenience'."
1,"I really enjoyed it. They did put ALOT of work into this place with even more crazy people to work the house. Somethings that really bugged me were the large groups we had to be in (4 to group would be a great/ isolation is key) and the unprofessional staff. We had two guys infront of us who were clearly intoxicated and ruined the entire event for us due to everytime someone approach them they were childish and mocked them back.  We told the staff inside the situation and if we could wait just to separate from them a bit but no help was offered and just told to  \""keep moving\"".  Once out side, we were told them same. \n\nGet the VIP tickets. The line outside with out them was crazier then ever."
1,"Stopped in for some Gelato for my nephew since it was so hot out. I understand this stuff melts, but why did it seem like it was melting before she scooped it? the gelato did not look appetizing one bit."
0,"The office seems really nice until you are serviced by the staff. It is rare the women at the front desk notices you walked in the door or greats you with a smile. Getting them to return a phone call is a joke. Now waiting on day 3 for a return call. I have called 4 times. Most of the nurses are nice though. I just went in and am sure Dr. Webb is on drugs from his surgery. He could hardly get a sentence out and could not answer any questions I had. The one person that was so nice however, is the lady who does the ultrasounds. One nurse completely blew me off with questions and concerns I had. I will never go back to this office and NEVER refer them to anyone, unless you want the worst service and care. We wanted 6 children thats a lot of money you just lost."
2,"Wanted to try something in the Vegas area recommended by Guy and Diners Drive in's and Dives...well this place was a dive alright, we couldn't even find the place after 3 drive by's..no signage, nothing in this strip mall!  Great array of international Flavors in small street sized tacos.  We had the plantains and black beans for an appetizer, yum, crispy and beans were flavorful and a bit sweet.  I had the Bombay, chicken in an Indian curry, good Flavors, i think mine was missing the chutney, because all I got was chicken in a curry sauce, nonetheless was flavorful, yet one dimensional, could have used that chutney.  Also had the pescador, a fish taco, a bit bland, but in a red cabbage slaw, white sauce and guacamole, the guacamole was a bit brown, I think it was a bit old - not memorable, but we come from San Diego, some of the best fish tacos anywhere!  Hubby had the shanghai and texano, he loved them both.  Good Flavors for a hole in the wall, right across the street from UNLV"
0,"I really don't want to have to do this because I've had such amazing experiences at Lebowskis before. But if this had been my first visit I would never be going back.\nWent for a Saturday night dinner and drinks treat and expected a lot better. I'd have the meat platter before and was craving it so was disappointed when it was no longer on the menu. When I asked the waitress about it I was reassured they still did it, it just wasn't printed on the menu. I happily handed over my money and sat back in anticipation. But what turned up was worse that dreadful. 4 slices of what i can only assume was Salisbury's bread along with a bundle of salmon, a bowl of haggis, bowl of black pudding and the worst over cooked steak I've ever attempted to eat. And that was all. What happened to the salad, the oatcakes, the chicken, the cooking skills??!! Eventually after prompting, the waitress brought me some cutlery and a few slices of lemon from the bar. \nI don't know what was going on in Lebowskis on Saturday but it was all dreadful. Our table was filthy, as was the one in the next booth. And no one came to clear our table long after we finished eating. \nI would have been irritated if I'd been told the platter was no longer available but at least that would have been honest. Instead I was fooled into buying a substandard meal. \nI think Lebowskis need to make up there minds about what they are offering as there customer experience. At the amazing yelp elite event not even a month ago they were all about gourmet, locally sourced food. Cooked to perfection and served in style. That all went out the window on Saturday. \nWill i go back, maybe. Should you go......? That's up to you."
3,If you are looking for a local BBQ and don't want to wait then Ryno's is for you.   They may not have the best BBQ but the service is normally pretty quick.   The mac n cheese is pretty good.   It can be kind of smoky inside. Staff could be a little more professional but it is quick service and decent food.  You won't leave hungry.
4,"We had dinner at Pasta Brioni the other night with my wife and some friends.  The atmosphere is quiet and inviting.  Max, our server, was very attentive and informative.  I normally eat chicken parmesan at italian restaurants but decided to expand my horizons and ordered the osso buco...what a pleasant surprise...very tender and tasty.  My wife and her friend had the home-made mushroom ravioli and said they were excellent.  We shared  bottle of wine and polished off the evening with home-made cheescake, which was to die for!\n\nI highly recommend Pasta Brioni for an evening out with friends or a date."
2,"I had reservations for 7PM.  I was promised a table overlooking the fountains.  My party and I arrived a little before 7 and the place was packed, the bar was overflowing with people.  I checked in with the hostess and was told it'll be a moment while they set up our table.  Ten minutes later she tells me that there are no tables available overlooking the fountains.  I said it fine, just seat us anywhere.  Finally, thirty minutes later we were finally seated at some cramped up table next to the restrooms.  How lovely. \n\nService was slow.  Food was whatever.  My brother ordered the special surf and turf.  Lobster was way rubbery and dry.  His steak was alright.  I ordered the special kobe beef plate.  It had 3 oz of each rib eye, filet mignon, and boneless sirloin.  A total of 9 oz of kobe for $240.  It was the most expensive plate I ever ordered.  And sadly I wasn't really that impressed by the food.  I had ordered them medium and the filet was beyond well done.  Sigh.  I had nothing to say about our sides and starters.  The wine we ordered was the only good thing about the meal.  I usually am a big fan of dessert but I was so thrown off by the food that I had to skip dessert.  \n\nFor our party of four, our bill ran out to a little over $600.  Thank God it was comped by the hotel (thanks to my mom's love of the slot machines), otherwise I would have had to make a run for it. I suggest dining at Michael Mina or Picasso when at the Bellagio.  Prime Steakhouse is for old folks with limited taste and too much time and too much money on their hands.  I feel a little bad saying that, especially since it seems like so many other people on Yelp enjoyed this place."
0,"darn it, wish I would have looked at this before sitting down to eat here. It took an hour for us to get our food served. Food was ok if you like a pound of curly fries served with everything. Mine was ok, ordered fish and chips but looked like the kind you buy at the frozen food section. But I was so hungry I ate them all. \nPrices seemed overly high considering the wait time and the quality. \nAlso, had some crappy service from the nearby arcade people after buying some ride tickets for virtual nascar, had to get a refund after waiting an hour there. Thats why we chose the cafe cuz we were tired and hungry. Would definitely advise NOT to eat here or use the arcade services."
0,"This is one of the worst places. Really I can't believe that they expect people to pay for this stuf they serve as food. We ordered fajitas & were served scraps of meat. Also, for a Mexican food restaurant to serve guacamole from a package is a bad sign."
2,Over priced food. Food was OK. \n\nNothing really speical about it. Maybe just the decorations.
2,"I had a great burger here the night--it was a no-frills deal, like something you're mom would've made if she were in a rush. But it was tasty. Coupled with a few beers (and the P-stone has a TON), it was a great little meal. \n\nThe P-stone's a cool little place, although it doesn't look like much from the street. In fact, it really doesn't look like anything at all, really. Groovy, mellow crowd hangs here, so it's not a real rowdy scene if that's what you're looking for. Very familiar feel--like a mom and pop deal, if that makes sense. It seems like a cook place to hang out with a bunch of friends on a random, quiet night."
4,"Tried this place for the first time on a Saturday last month and went back the very next day! Yes, It is that delicious!\n\nWithin our group we tried their stone crab, shrimp in garlic sauce, fried chicken, steak, macaroni and cheese, and roasted corn and if I could I would of tasted more! \n\nTheir service was also excellent and fast, and valet parking is free! (Gratuity still appreciated however). \n\nI cannot wait to go back!"
1,"Absolutely appalling customer service. I waited almost a half as hour to exchange a tool and EVERY one they had in stock was also broken. Complete garbage. The staff seems completely uninterested in long wait and lines. I watched other customers stand and wait equally long for tools from the back warehouse. If you go, don't be in a hurry and fully expect to return half of what you buy."
2,"Had dinner with a large group. We had a superb wine, but I'm sure it was not cheap and was chosen by the host of the dinner. The food? Well...the chopped salad was pretty mediocre, and too filling with all the red kidney beans it it. The table breads and muffins were too dry, kind of inedible.\n\nDuck pancake...like someone had poured half a bottle of cheap, sweet syrup on it so who knows what the duck tasted like.\n\nThe porterhouse lamb chops - very good. This was by far the best thing I had. The lamb was perfectly grilled, and the sauce was inoffensive so you could enjoy the meat. \n\nDessert - that warm, pudding-like cake that I can't remember. It was good, and chocolate. Like many restaurants they served the dessert and then came around asking for coffee as kind of an afterthought. The coffee service took so long that it was tough to wait on eating the cake. Dang, I like coffee WITH dessert. But, most restaurants haven't figured out how to serve both at around the same time.\n\nThe restaurant is a nice spot in Caesars so I don't want to dissuade people from going. But, I'd make the grilled meat the centerpiece of what you order and not get too high on hope for the rest, based on what I experienced. And get a nice bottle of wine to go with it!"
0,"Spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting. Weird, pasty sauce. Whole place seems kind of dirty. Booths need to be wiped down. Don't go here unless you're an undergraduate with low standards."
3,"Toast is an excellent place for a weekend breakfast out. The service is very efficient and all the wait staff seems to work as a team (anyone will refill your coffee or fill any immediate need you may have). Prices are very reasonable and the food is above average, By that I mean their eggs, coffee, corn bread, fruit, etc. are all better than what you would expect from a popular price restaurant - most breakfast entries were $8 and under- but the fruit salad was as good as you have at home, if you had a well stocked kitchen. The place is perfect for young families as service is fast and prices are very moderate. Not only will your children like it but you can bring the grandparents as they will be the only ones who will recognize the music playing. \nIf you find their food is not up to your very high standards then breakfast at The Gallery or Cafe Monte or Zebras and pay two times Toast's prices; for me Toast hits the sweet spot between quality and price,"
2,Really good tacos but overpriced for what it is.
1,"Waited an hour for a flu shot... Ridiculous\nI came after a suggestion from walgreens that it was cheaper and easier there. This was not true. My time is worth more than a $7 discount. Also staff was not impressive, massive bruise the morning after from adjusting the needle in my muscle. Will not return."
1,"So when a friend suggested this place, I thought, \""Cool.  Another restaurant to try. Glad Charlotte has stepped it up for the foodies.\""  Except...they didn't. \n\nThe service (by Nathan) was great and attentive, but the food was forgettable at best, and embarrassing at worst.  We ordered a salad with chicken which was good, and the she-crab soup, which was actually very nice, but everything else needed serious improvement.  \n \nAmong the five of us, four of us had to add a significant amount of salt and pepper to our food.  The fish was overcooked, the risotto under-seasoned and looked as though it was being \""vomited\"" out of the squash \""bowl\"" in which it was served.  As for the shrimp and grits, the grits were sticky and bland, and the sausage was flavorless, gritty, and drowning in an oily gravy.  For a price tag of 20 bucks, there should have been more than five shrimp included. \n\nThe only save of the evening was the ass-kicking piano player, who worked through a repertoire of big band classics, pop tunes, and a Super Mario Brothers medley that was spot on.\n\nBottom line?  Go for the drinks and the music, but skip the food!"
2,"Things did not go as well on another visit with a different couple.  First of all, one of my favorites, the Asian Dumplings, having been cut from the menu, are no more.  And Mango for Mango Iced Tea has been replaced by a mango-flavored syrup which was not well received by two of my fellow diners.  A new app, Thai Phoon Shrimp is billed as tender and crispy shrimp tossed in a Sweet & Spicy Chile Sauce, but I and a table mate found the shrimp to be too heavily breaded, and the sauce too cloyingly sweet.\n\nMy Jambalaya Pasta, consisting of chicken, shrimp, and slices of Andouille Sausage mixed in a creamy sauce with linguine was hot and spicy but not that flavorful, and the sausage tasted like thin, spicy pieces of fried hot dog.  As usual, the make your own salad from the Salad Bar, this time with French Dressing, was excellent, although few spring greens were on hand to go with Iceberg Lettuce and spinach leaves.  Diane very much liked her Coastal Trio of sweet lobster, tilapia, and skewered shrimp.\n\nService was good, and booth seating comfortable."
1,"Had a meeting at ASU after lunch and picked this place to eat and prepare. No wi-fi was a HUGE downer. I suppose I understand the management not wanting people to stay all day, but next time I'm looking for a place to do a working lunch, I'll look elsewhere.\n\nFood was okay, too. And canned sodas meant I couldn't take a refill with me. I had the plain chicken sandwich and it was plain."
3,"Awesome place. Great service, superb food, and fun drinks. What more could you ask for?"
1,"Went here for lunch this week. All of Lake Las Vegas is pretty much deserted, so there weren't very many lunch choices to begin with. The food was par. The cobb salad was your run of the mill. The wine was decent, but a stingy pour. The waiter was friendly, maybe a little too much if you catch my drift. Overall an average experience. The food is a little pricey and the service seemed to be a little slow considering the lack of a crowd. I probably would not go back."
3,Ate here twice during a recent visit to LV.  \nGreat food & great staff.  Super helpful in navigating significant drink and food options.  Typical overpriced LV though. Perhaps 30-40% inflated just because it is inside of ARIA.
1,"This Terrible's is pretty close to my house. I stop there for beer on my way home.\n\nUsed the car wash one time, I felt I payed way too much, for a horrible car wash. \n\nNever pumped gas there, because it's higher in price than most gas stations in my area. \n\nThe convenience store has a good selection of products, at a decent price. \n\nThe beer cavern is great, because it's the coldest beer, in miles.\n\nIt's not the easiest parking lot to get in and out of. It's usually crowded, and parking spots are hard to find.\n\nThe employees are pretty much what you can expect from Minimum Wage Employees.\n\nI will still go there, as long as the price is right."
2,"I am a Mediterranean food junkie!! Khoury's is really authentic Lebanese food which always satisfies my cravings. It is extremely delicious and addicting! I recommend the chicken kabob plate with hummus. The fatosh salad is amazing too! I've had problems in the past with slow service but they are very friendly which, for me, makes up for it. :)"
2,Went for the first time on a Saturday evening and I don't think I've ever had as much fun at dinner before.  I had never heard of the restaurant before and have to admit I was leery about combining chicken and waffles for dinner.  Just reading the menu had me laughing so hard I was nearly in tears.  I ordered the Betty Boop which is a breast & a waffle.  The breading was tasty and the chicken was fall of the bone tender.  Pricing was reasonable and the experience was overall good.
4,"I've been shopping here for a few years and this shop is the best. Fantastic prices, friendly staff, shelves full with great selection, open late. I'm always glad to support my local businesses!! Highly recommended!!"
0,"Horrible experience! Got there at 1 am and the front desk worker wasn't there. The lights were turned off so I called with the after hours phone. After 10 minutes, someone let us in and we stood at the counter and he finally walked up, then told us we couldn't check in for an hour because the computer was down. Finally got to our room 2 hours later! Horrible experience!"
1,"Cute place, high priced cup cakes for the size. Nice that it's gluten free but I spent $30 and really can't say any thing I bought was memorable"
1,Was really looking forward to eating here but was so disappointed. I ordered chicken Marsala and I got chicken swimming in basically soup. It was just terrible. Guess I should have stuck with the pizza.
1,"The food was ok. I got the Orange Chicken and it was plentiful. The service was terrible though. They were mean little Asians here. Told me I couldn't add shrimp, then charged me $2 to take more rice??  I felt like I was in s different country. They gave me a kids cup to start with. Will never be back."
0,This is the worst place ever. They don't even deserve 1 star. I went to get my\nOil changed they recommended I have my battery cleaned as well. My car was then stuck in 4wheel drive. I had to go to 2 different mechanics to have it fixed. The people at this jiffy lube should NEVER be able to touch anyone's car.
2,"last stop on the \""cosmo food crawl \"" \n\nStarting to feel the effects of the crawl but we gotta make a final stop for the restaurant that allegedly makes some of the best pasta in the U.S. \n\nAgain, sat in the lounge area of the restaurant. While waiting for the table, i tried a few of the chips that are complementary at the bar - very good ! had fried basil blended in with some bite to them - not sure if it was red pepper or not. \n\nWhile we were virtually ignored at Comme Ca, Scarpetta was the other end of the spectrum ( an not in a good way ) - our server was nice but man, way to pushy on trying to up sell, especially the drinks. \n\nWent with lighter wine this time - name escapes me but it was a $10 glass - nice. We also opted for some sparkling water - $9. \n\nOrdered the spaghetti ( $24 ) , the creamy polenta with fricasse mushrooms ( $16 ) and the branzino ( sis wanted the cod but the server almost insisted that the branzino was the way to go - she relented - $26 ) \n\nThe spaghetti was a joy - might be tad bit too strong in basil , but it worked for me. What surprised us was a little heat to the sauce - the server was also a little surprised to hear this ... to the point i don't think she believed us. \n\nThe polenta was extremely rich but dang good. the fricasse was better here than the mushrooms we had at comme ca and helped cut through some of the richness of the polenta. \n\nThe branzino was perfectly cooked, simple seasoning but great taste. nice. \n\nWe went with the amedei Chocolate cake ( basically a molton lava cake $11) with a toasted almond gelato and a salted caramel sauce ( the reason why we got it - $3) and then a separate scoop of tangerine sorbet. \n\nI tell ya, that tangerine was a heck of finish to our food fest - so frickin refreshing - I will go back for that every time i'm in the building !!"
0,If I could give them a lower score I would. Horrible decline in quality of service. Very low morale of employees leading to poor service. Used to be great and I would go there before any other car wash or other service.
2,"Food is average with sandwiches being $8-$10.  Had a burger with Pork Barbecue on it and onion straws and an iced tea for about $14.  Little pricey at lunch.  Surprised there was only 1 bartender/waitress for the whole bar area, but she did a good job managing it.  There were probably 20 people at the bar.  The restaurant has a bunch of TV's on sports or trivia.  The restaurant was crowded which is probably due to its location in the USX building."
1,Asked for a goose island ipa. They were out but offered a sam adams ipa. I said sounds good. Waitress came back and said they were also out of the sam adams. So I just said bring me whiskey on the rocks. 2 stars because they didn't have the beer I wanted. On a positive note the waitress was very friendly and apologetic.  Although she was slow to get our bill and serve our second drinks. Don't order anything to close to boarding you might not make your flight.
1,Food was good but nothing special. Portions are small. For what you pay you are better off going somewhere else. Will never go here again.
2,"This place has lost a star.  Ok, I love my club host, who totally sets me up with getting into places, and he didn't disappoint here either... \n\nbut maybe it was the night I was there (fri) or the crowd or something, but it was just off.  Like not good off the hook, off.\n\nThe club wasn't nearly as busy as it usually is, there were tables empty, the bartenders were actually smiling and waiting to help serve you, rather than being 5 deep in customers, and there was no wait for the women's bathroom.  (that right there should tell you 'something is wrong')\n\ndrinks were good, i can't say I didn't have fun, but by 1am i was ready to go, and headed back to the strip to do some other clubs."
4,"Oh my goodness. I didn't know what outstanding auto service was until I came to Rebel Auto!!!! So professional. So kind. The free play arcade while you wait? AWESOME! It isn't like a cheap gimmick. It's legit!!! The price is perfect - way better than what the dealer charges for my  2 year old car. I couldn't believe how fast they got my oil change done, either. And they gave me recommendations but didn't pressure me. Being new to the area, I'm so glad I found Rebel Auto. I believe they have gained a customer for life!"
1,"I hope you don't think that I'm too critical by the end of this review. \n\nBut honestly I've been to better dive bars. The first thing that struck me was the location. Crap! It shares a wall the the Trunk Space, on a corner of Grand Ave and 7th ave I believe. Getting there, maneuvering the strange sharp turns, and then locating a parking spot definitely downs my drinking enthusiasm.  -1 for initial placement. Although, if you happen to be catching a show at the Trunk Space, this place is 5 steps away. \n\nWhen I first entered the place, I admit I was impressed with the interior decor. The whole tiki-style theme was nice and consistent. Except for all the stuff behind the bar. I mean a piece of paper with a note written with a marker saying \""We have the right to refuse anyone service\"", just screams \""low class establishment here\"" to me. At least the air conditioning and lighting were comforting.\n\nThe service was decent. The lack of crowd allowed my party and I the utmost dedicated attention. I ordered a large pitcher of Blue Moon, which if you have a three person group, the price is pretty good. You get three smaller than usual frosted glasses which I liked. However, as a fan of Blue Moon, I was unimpressed by how bland the white ale tasted!! I'm sure it was flat. It was cold though. Ill give them that.\n\nOverall, I would come back again, but only if I happen to be at the Trunk Space. I see no reason to deliberately make this place my destination.\n\nBy the way this place is Cash Only......"
3,"Don't let the appearance fool you, this had good quality sandwiches. Get the grilled pork it's my favorite. really good prices too."
3,"Everything I've ordered from here has been pretty good. I will often stop here when I don't feel like cooking and the food comes out fast. The atmosphere isn't the greatest, but I'd you're doing take out that shouldn't be an issue."
4,"Wow! I'm sad that I didn't find out about this place earlier. I'm just glad I now know of a great sandwich shop that is very unique and not like many others. They really seem to come up with some creative and delicious creations. I got the bobbi and the cheese steak and both were very very good.\n\nThe Bobbi tasted like the morning after Thanksgiving day which turkey, stuffing, and cranberry. It really was the perfect combination. Not too soggy, not too dry. \nThe cheese steak had a little bit of a kick with the peppers and it definitely had the right amount of meat and cheese combination. I can't wait to try out the Capistrami next time which looks amazing. \n\nAs for value, i think it's quite good for a 9' sub (plenty for me) for about $7. I would definitely recommend this place!"
3,"Quite nice. Small, casual, and reasonably priced. I'd recommend the Tom Yum Soup, Spicy Basil, and fresh rolls! BYOB. This amount of food was about right for two people of moderate hunger."
4,Pools!! Room!! Nice place! Lots of Fun!! The pools are allot of fun!!  FUN FUN FUN

0,"Well I hate to be the first one to write a bad review, but with how much they wanted for repairs on my truck was ridiculous. I went to Howies based on the reviews on Yelp. I told them what I thought was wrong with my truck, but I did this to see if they would go along with it. Next thing I knew they agreed with what I said and gave me a labor quote for $1200, but 2/3 of the repairs they quoted weren't needed at all; those were the $$$ ones.  So I took my business elsewhere and had my truck good as new for $175 in labor."
0,"I really would like to love this gym, but their salespeople have driven me to hate it. They went to the used car salesman school of membership sales. Rather than telling me how amazing their gym and equipment are, it's all about how I need to sign up today, this special ends today, and your life will be much worse off if you don't sign up today. Honestly, probably what set the alarm bells ringing was them demanding my social security number. Why on earth does a gym need a social security number? I only give my SSN to banks. Period. A gym is not getting and does not need my SSN--particularly since they withdraw dues from your credit card automatically! \n\nBeware, the 7-day free pass is not a free pass. They force you to sign up for a membership, which they say they will allow you to cancel in 7 days. Simply disingenuous.\n\nThe gym itself is nice, clean and has plenty of equipment. It's just too bad that I feel like they're trying to scam me when I try to join."
4,"Ok, if you make a trip to Las Vegas, you must frequent O'Sheas Casino. Let me preface this review.  If you are one of those up class folks, looking for fancy pleasantries, that usually cost a lot of money and require dressing up, this is NOT the place to go.  However, if you are trying to find a homey, casual bar, probably like the one you frequent at home, the O'Sheas on the Las Vegas strip is the place to go. There are no foods I can't pronounce, no long lines with 21yrs in barely nothing, no covers, and no bouncers that think they are god's gifts to mankind. Nope, none of that. \n\n\nLocated across from Ceasar's this place has everything you need. Cheap tables, lots of slots, live music, cheap food, and beer pong....yes, I said beer pong! O'Sheas has several Hold'em tables located right at the entrance that have not only a minimum $2 bet, but also a max of $6. This means no high rolling rich guy can buy the pot...you gotta know how to play. They also have the usual; black jack, roulette, crazy poker and tons of others. Most times, as low as $5 with really nice dealers. There is a \""high roller\"" section for poker. In back, there are several affordable food places; burger king, pizza, subway, and little place that sells awesome rice and chicken and $3 hotdogs.  In addition to the music playing in the casino, on the weekends, the place has live music up front. I have only seen three groups but they were all great singing a variety of music.  And lastly, while I don't play true beer pong (dirty ball rolling on the ground in my beer) I do think the game is pretty damn awesome.  And watching drunk people play is equally as fun. So I applaud the place for appealing to what people like."
1,"Third visit to the Flamingo,first two were wonderful. Desk staff on last visit was a nightmare, Casandra seemed to take pride in her rude ,bulling attitude. I don't know if she treat all seniors this way, but we insulted. For some reason she thinks if your hair is grey it is ok to treat us as  second class persons, who's credit card she controls.\n\nFlamingo shame on you, your front house staff is the worst I have ever had to deal with."
0,If you order online and it's wednesday or later in the week DO NOT  use 2d day UPS you will not get your part unless you're  very close by. I'm in Texas and ordered on wednesday thinking I could get my parts by saturday latest.....nope 5 days later they arrive(what the Hell is 2 day air?) needless to say no more business from me. Yes I wrote them and they didn't have the courtesy to reply either.
2,"Came here for a networking event a couple weeks ago. They had some apps out to try and my friend ordered the quesadilla that was on happy hour. Nothing remarkable about this place food wise. I ordered a moscow mule and it was good.\n\nWe were outside on the patio which is super cute. Definitely a great place to have some wine and sit outside and enjoy the perfect weather. \n\nI need to try the main dishes because I wasn't that impressed with the food we had. We tried their chicken wings, ahi avocado salad of some sort, flatbread and parmesan, and then my frriend's quesadilla. It wasn't that the food was bad, it's just not something that I'm ever gonna think about and be like \""hey, remember xyz at Kitchen 56?\"". \n\nWorth a shot to try but it's just whatever."
1,"This place has some potential but has a lot of kinks to work out in order to avoid frustrating the customers. \n\nPros: The bowling lanes are very cool! They take photos of the bowlers and put them alongside your name on the screen that shows the scores. And they superimpose the faces from your team onto various cartoons during the game. My kids thought this was HILARIOUS. \n\nMy kids also loved the interactive video playing on the floor outside the bowling area. I watched jumping on pretend bugs, toppling pretend bowling pins, etc for a long time. They all seemed to love it. \n\nCons: I was able to watch the interactive video area because I waited nearly an HOUR to be helped at the dining table in the bowling area. I think I would *still* be there if I hadn't sought out a server myself. And there was a cluster of people near the entrance to the bowling area, which was annoying and made it hard to get in and out. I don't know if they were waiting for a lane, or just socializing there bc they had friends playing in the nearby lane, or what?? But the staff should have relocated them and cleared the flow of people in that area. \n\nAlso the process of buying a ticket for the gravity ropes course was very confusing. We waited in one line, then were told to move to the other line, which meant we had to go to the back of that line and start the wait all over. The bottleneck also blocked the entrance to the shop. \n\nLet people buy laser tag & ropes course tickets at the kiosks instead! And make sure the staff doesn't ignore people waiting to be served. \n\nAlso the nachos were terrible. They were served without salsa (?) and so once you got the few toppings off the top layer, you were left with a stack of chips and nothing to eat them with. The pizza was very good."
3,Solid 4 stars for the food itself.  Service was a little lacking though.  The brunch menu was delightful.  I ordered the grilled cheese and it was made from Tillamook Cheese!!!  I'd recognize that taste anywhere.  Took me back to the grilled cheese sandwiches I used to make myself when I was growing up on the West Coast.  Will probably be back to try other items on the menu.
3,"Yum if you like buttery selections (eg. Broccoli , mac'n'cheese, mashed potatoes).  They do have a nice selection of Asian foods.  We went for lunch.  The dude cutting the meats have a positive attidude and makes the experience more enjoyable .  Though the price is a little high $41.99 for weekend brunch, but definitely worth a try.  You can save a whole buck if you are a current Caesar card holder, woot."
0,"It pains me to write this because I've been a patron for many years buying various odds and bits when I couldn't wait for online orders to ship. But their repair service has repeatedly let me down to the point where I don't think I want to give them any of my business anymore.\n\nOn the first occasion, they managed to completely lose track of a fairly expensive lens I had left with them to be repaired. They never called me with updates like they kept promising. I was always the one calling them, and having to re-explain my story to people who all gave me different excuses and were more preoccupied with shifting the blame than figuring out where my lens had gone. They seemed to be making time more than looking into it.\nThankfully they eventually found it, but the ordeal took a few months. \nGood thing I had other equipment that could stand in.\n\nOn the second occasion, my worries began on the day I left the camera with them because three employees were confused as to how the form was filled out, and whether that was the correct form at all, of course blaming someone else in the process. I was glad I hung on to my receipt.\nI was told they would contact me within about a week with an estimate. After three weeks I was still without news so I called them, and was told off-hand that because of the type of camera, it could easily take four to six weeks. I wasn't happy but it didn't look like I had a choice. Finally after two months with still absolutely no news from them, I called back and explained the situation. Apparently the repairman was waiting to get some additional equipment from me to test the camera. I asked why no one ever contacted me to tell me this. No answer. I asked how long that request had been pending. Apparently since after one week. I asked why I was told 4-6 weeks, and why no one checked my file at that point. He didn't know, and said 4-6 weeks is completely wrong.\n\nI'll now be dealing directly with the repairman, as it seems the Photo Service team is incapable of getting their ducks in a row, or of providing a suitable explanation for why things go wrong. Unprofessional and unaccountable are not qualities I want to see in people I let handle expensive photo equipment.\n\nBottom line, if you rely on your equipment for work and need it back in a predictable amount of time - avoid this place. Having broken equipment is difficult enough; if you need the repair experience to not be an additional source of stress and frustration - avoid this place.\nIn fact, probably best getting acquainted with mechanics and repair shops directly and developing your network of people who can stand by what they do."
4,I was nervous to try this spa because we stayed at the Monte Carlo and the hotel really needs an upgrade. My room was gross. But any way the spa was very nice. I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nStaff was very friendly. Clean facilities. Has everything you need. The showers are nice private rooms. I got a signature facial and it felt amazing. Im 8 months preg and it took a while for me to get comfortable laying down but the therapist was very helpful offering extra pillows and moving the bed around for me. It ended up a very needed relaxing experience.\n\nI wouldn't stay at this hotel again but I would def recommend the spa
4,"The d\u00e9cor is simple but upscale, service is very good, and the price is way high for the tiniest plates I've ever had, but this is some of the best food I've ever had!  Just a beautiful exotic dance of familiar flavors, warm and melting in your mouth.  The steak melted on my tongue!  Where did it go?  Just slid down my throat!  Sweet Jesus!  Went there on a date, spent over a hundred bucks, ordering plate after plate of food that made me cry for what I've missed all my life.  Do I still think it's over priced?  Yes, because I haven't been back since this time last year!  Just too much to pay and still have no leftovers.  FYI, I'm 5'8 with a 27 in waist, no fatty but I expect to be fed!  Perhaps I also fear that our next encounter cannot top the first, so I savor this sweet memory..."
4,"Staff is awesome. Food is yummy. My kids love smashburger.  I prefer some other places, but their food is still tasty."
0,Horrible! Worst FedEx/Kinkos I've ever been to! They need to get new computers or clean up the ones they have.  It takes FOREVER just to load up a browser and don't even think about doing multiple functions on it. It froze up on me 5 times when I was trying to print. Just froze for a good minute. I told the staff (some tall young brunette) and she didn't give me a second glance. Just went about her business (and I was the ONLY person in there)!!!!  This place is absolutely pathetic. Only used them because my printers out of ink...I'll just go get more ink. Avoid!!!!
1,"This Subway is in the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten at this particular restaurant several times and it was just regular old Subway.  There are so many better choices near by for sandwiches,  I can't seem to understand how this place can be so busy.  Subway claims to want to offer better health choices for customers, yet they regularly offer \""footlong\"" subs that are marginally more expensive than a 6-inch sandwich.\n\nIf you are looking for a decent sandwich in the area, head over to Crave (my favorite) or corner bakery."
1,"This place is terrible. The only redeeming thing on the menu are the shakes. We ordered the drunken monkey which was nice but too watery for my taste. I prefer a thick shake.\n\n The burgers were overdone and the meat did not taste like quality meat. We asked for medium but they were beyond medium- dry and tough. The fries were also overdone. I ordered the Funghi burger. Wouldn't recommended it. Their \""best seller\"" the Gold Standard wasn't great either. Neither of us ate even half of our burgers and neither did most of the people at the table next to ours. \n\nThey bring you a spicy zesty mini bucket of popcorn which tasted better than any of the other things we ordered. \n\nThe service was friendly and helpful but the food just isn't good. It boggles my mind that this place has a 4-star average rating. It just doesn't make any sense.\n\nMaybe it was just an off night for the food but I wouldn't go back."
3,"As my boyfriend and I was walking around the food court in the Metro Center Mall, one of the employees in front of Charley's Grilled Subs handed us a sample of their special limited time offer Chicken Sub (I don't see the exact name on their online menu).  After we tried a bite, we knew we were getting one.  :D  I guess the employee noticed our smile of approval so she handed us each a coupon to save $0.50 a sub.  Woot!  :)\n\nThe service was fast and subs were prepared as they were being ordered.  The regular french fries were really tasty.  Humorously packed in a cup, too!  :D"
1,"Very unimpressed. I expected alot more based on all the hype.  All the fries that came to our table were cold and soggy. My chicken sandwich was cold as well, and the chicken was VERY bland!  Both the Sprite and the Ketchup were amazing though!  I hope they can get it together.  DTLV needs some decent places to eat. Good luck.  Service was acceptable."
4,"We originally found Joe's while vacationing in Anaheim and were SO HAPPY that they have one close to us in Tempe. The atmosphere of this place is AMAZING. I love how they are so patient while you decide from the infinite list of ever changing flavors, and let you sample everything you like! Service is amazing, and of course the product is one of a kind. Nothing compares!!!! We will definitely be visiting frequently."
4,"Let me add to the 5 star reviews here!\n\nMy husband and I got the sampler plates and oh man....we are so glad we found this place. Best BBQ ever. Brisket was tender & flavorful, pulled pork was juicy and tender and smokey, sausage was perfect, sauces were amazing....\n\nThe sides were all great (get the beans!)"
4,"Just randomly stopped by the container park today for the first time. My wife and I had no idea this place was here and decided to try it. We ordered the raw \""chicken\"" salad wraps, and the tlc juice. We normally wouldn't order a juice but thought we would give it a chance. And we loved it! The chicken salad is now our new favorite food in Las Vegas!!! GO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!!! You won't regret it!"
0,"YUCK! Why does everyone rave about this place? The pizza crust is TOO thin - it was SOGGY!  And they cut a ROUND pizza in SQUARES!!! WTF??? So I wound up with little weird-shaped outer pieces, and two large SQUARE center slices that were SO soggy that they just hung down when I tried to pick them up. Soggy and greasy. \n\nThe cheese and mushrooms were good, but the sauce was indeed WAY too sweet as others have noted, and the so-called 'crust' was nasty and mushy. This is NOT Chicago pizza! I've had pizza in Chicago, deep dish AND regular, and this was NOT like any of it."
1,"It's okay, but not great. If you can pick up tickets on the cheap, or if you have magic-minded children, you can have a nice hour of entertainment that will give you something to discuss later at dinner.\n\nThe difference between good and great illusions is in the subtleties. Nathan is a pretty okay magician. To be great, it would take a substantial investment in time and money in the production effort. I don't suspect that's the future here: they are going with cheap ticket prices and variations on classic illusions. It's a business choice.\n\nPlan to play \""spot the hiding space\"" a lot. Even your kids can take part in the adventure."
2,My only complaint is they are pricey compared to other quality sushi restaurants ie sakana on Hayden and Indian school but the food was good service was good and the ambience is comfortable
4,"Best pizza and variety in Vegas. So many awesome varieties. Normally I'm a one trick pony, pepperoni and I'm good. But here I've had the Margherita, and Honey Pie which is amazing. \n\nCan't go wrong here."
4,"We had Jessica, she was great! Our 14 month old boy's haircut turned out perfectly and she was very patient with him wiggling around! He had his first haircut at a different location and I didn't like how it turned out, but I read good reviews about this location and Jessica, so we gave it a shot. Glad we did! We'll be back!"
4,HONEST. RELIABLE. CARING!!!!! \nHands down this is the ONLY place I come to when I need automotive replacements and repairs!!! I just changed by spark plugs and tightened my belt. Great service with great prices!! Recommend Hondoctors!!!!!
0,"If I could rate them 0 I would. I am still sitting on the side of the road waiting for them to arrive I called 3 hours ago and they said 75 minutes and they still are not here. Last I checked 75 minutes was 1 hour and 15 minutes. After reading all the reviews it's clear this company does not care about their reputation. I have say in the Arizona heat for 3 hours because of their lack of professionalism.  Do not use this company at all seriously call someone else. I just called another company because it's been 3.5 hours and I haven't even gotten an update or courtesy call. The other company said 1.5 hours give or take 15 minutes let's see who shows up first. I will update with answer soon\n\nCentral showed up after 4hours, I did cancel the other tow cause I'm not rude, but I will never use central towing again because they were not remotely close to the time promised even 30 min late would have been forgivable but 2 hours 45 min late in 100 degree weather is unacceptable. Then offering no discount or anything stay away"
3,My friend and I have a list of places we want to try and this was on it. We went on a Saturday and had no problem being seated. Our server was great. He helped us with recommendations since it was our first time there. We started off with the Snoqualmie Riesling and it was delish. We then split a salad and a sandwich. The salad was roasted beet and the sandwich was the kobe burger and fries. Both were good and cooked to our specs. I would go again and try some other things on the menu.
2,"At 5:30am on Las Vegas Boulevard, Denny's is your friend\n\nI usually do not have much love for Denny's these days, but after a long night of partying, this location on the Las Vegas Strip can be just the right place for the right price. \n\nDo not go here sober: you will be the only one besides the staff and will not like it. \n\nHordes of sweaty tourists and drunken revelers slide through this place 24 hours per day all year long and it shows. It is the dirtiest Denny's you will ever sit in, and that's saying a lot. \n\nBut do not mind those minor details; remember, you are drunk and hungry, and Uncle Denny is here to help with that headache. Inside this diner you will experience the greatest craving for substandard food in your life. In a swirling and spinning haze with sounds that cut in and fade out, you will throw out your sensibilities and last vestiges of decency and want everything on the menu like an uncultured swine. Gazing at the menu with a childlike sense of awe and amazement--somewhere in your brain's basement a little voice will pose this question: does this place employ a hypnotist?--you start to feel that each perfectly posed piece of colorful food on the menu is beckoning you. \n\nGive into those feelings my hard-partying friend; you've earned the right to sit at the booth of frat kings that has comforted hundreds of thousands of bacchanalian souls coming off 15-hour sprees of drinking, gambling, and dancing with Dionysus just like you. You are now in the sticky, vinyl throne of Vegas. You have arrived. \n\n(For the best 24-hour eats in Vegas, head to Mr. Lucky's 24/7 in the Hard Rock Hotel; that diner cannot be beat during the in-between times)."
2,"Typically a nickel to seven cents cheaper than the national average and a better than average store. Always congested and on a very busy corner, but worth the stop just in gas savings."
1,"very blah food.. The gumbo was decent. the truffle mac and cheese was ok, but lacked salt. I ordered the salmon and specifically told the waiter that I wanted it close to rare, but the salmon that was brought out was well done. I can understand if you cannot cook the salmon rare.. but if u are telling me that you can, you better bring it out rare. my friend had the porchatta - said that it was ok, but felt like spam. overall, very blah food."
2,"Ordered food togo. Pizza was okay, not great though my daughter liked it. Order not exactly what I ordered, but not bad. Ordered linguini with mussels in red sauce, got just mussels; preferred string green beans with spinach, got soggy spinach with broccoli and cauliflower, no green beans. Calimari was fresh, but not crispy fried-soft. Maybe things were off this night. Will give it another shot. I wanna like it. Hope it is better."
0,The restaurant no longer exists.
2,"I've been here twice.  My first experience was awful.  After being seated for 15 minutes and having at least 5 different servers all make eye contact with us as they were tending to people who had been seated after us, my husband, daughter and I walked out.\n\nThe second time we went, the service was only marginally better.  The server was okay, but only good enough to get a \""c\"" grade.  Never once did she or anyone else even ask how our food was once delivered.  She made it seem like we were an unwanted obligation.  \n\nI will say that the food is truly amazing.  The green chile pork is wonderful and the have the best mimosas I've ever drank.  There are so many items in the menu that I'm excited to try but only if the level of service improves--it definitely sets a negative tone for the entire meal.\n\nCan good food be ruined by bad service? Without a doubt!!! I will give this place one last shot and hope that the third time I a charm."
2,"I don't hate it. \nI don't love it. \nI'm very blah about it.\n\n\nInitially wanted to come here after seeing pictures on Instagram. I was super excited as I was hoping for snow like that from Hawaii snow places, like Snow Factory or Frost City.\n\nMy friends and I had #3, #4, #5 respectively. I don't like the \""popping pearls\"" in my #5 so, I replaced it with butterfinger.\n\nI'd like to say it was similar in texture being kind of creamy but, they need to improve on their flavors. I got to samps the taro, green tea, and \""kuma snow\"" (whatever flavor that it) and it was whatever......it quenched my thirst in this heat we're having.\nI'd like to see more variety ---- I'm thinking of the variety that Snow Ono food/shave ice truck had --- I miss horchata flavor, I guess.\n\nI loved how the decor is all bright and cute. Tryna get the whole Asian-kawaii market. I mean, that's what got me.....very Instagram worthy pics outta here.\n\nOverall, I'll be back. Businesses tend to get better in time ***cross fingers*** \nI wanna bring more people so we can \""samps\"" more things; this way I don't base this review on just 3 flavors."
0,"First, let me say that Cafe Rio as a whole is a good fast food choice.  I've been to other locations and have been satisfied.\nHowever, this location is very poorly managed.  Service is horrible, whatever the time of day and however many people are in line ahead of you, it's just painfully slow.  Amazing, really, given the 10-12 workers they have behind the counter. They are always out of items on the menu, and the obnoxious day manager just blames the night crew.  No apologies, no offer to try and make it right, just blame and a blank stare (pick something else! is implied, I guess).  I've given this place 5 or 6 chances now, but I won't be back.  Shame, really, since it's right down the street from where I live and would be very convenient."
2,"Oh Paris, what happened? We used to love staying here, but this time may have been our last. The restaurants are still good, but the drink service is nearly non-existent in the casino, and the rooms are very outdated. Also, the casino had a stronger smoke smell than other casinos we visited (MGM, Mirage, etc)\n\nI was happy to see an empty fridge in the armoire replacing the old tube tv, but later that happiness was replaced by shock. Who decided to place the new flatscreens way to the side of the bed?  \n\nMy husband and I were enjoying our kid-free holiday and watched several of your $15 in-room movies during our stay. However, we were forced to either get cricks in our necks or move to the very uncomfortable french style couch in order to view them. At one point, we almost moved the entire bed. \n\nWe heard there are some renovated rooms in the upper stories, so be sure to ask for them."
2,Delicious cocktails! This will be a hot spot now that the weather is warming up for sure. I wish they had outdoor seating to soak in the view and provide additional space. Valet is $10 - $7 if you validate. I parked in a lot a few feet from the valet for $6- if possible I would recommend walking on taking the train as the entrance was a bit tricky to find. I will come back and sample the food - just enjoyed well mixed drinks after work.
4,"My family and I are so thankful for Allison's help!! We were renting a home here in Vegas for about a year and she helped us buy it recently! I found her  here on Yelp due to her outstanding reviews and thought obviously lets call her!  I'm so happy I did.. I mean, she is an amazing person! I think she is super cool and we actually have alot in common. Great person to work with, and she was able to help us with so much more including inspections, appraisals, any questions we had she was there for us or knew someone that could help us. Made this easier than I ever imagined it to be... Thank you so much Allison!!!"
0,"I really want to like this place, but I've had a bad experience every time I've ordered from them. A few weeks ago, I ordered delivery from Nam's and my food took almost an hour longer than the estimated arrival time. When I finally received my food, there was a curly black hair sitting directly on top of my curry. Luckily, I still had my crab rangoons and I was able to eat those, but I certainly had no appetite for the curry... I called Nam's as soon as I found the hair and was told by the employee that answered the phone that he would \""leave a note\"" about getting me a free entree next time I ordered from them. Well, I just ordered food from them again and received a very rude phone call from one of the workers demanding to know why I was receiving a free entree. Let's just say that I am a little insulted that, after I gave them a second chance, they would call me and accuse me of lying to get free food. \n\nSide Note: After being reassured that my food would be here in 45 minutes, it has now been an hour and I am officially never ordering from here again."
3,"they have reallyreally good umeshu.  i have no idea how much it was but it was so rich and sweet and mmmm.  good cooked plates, pretty good sushi chefs.  id definitely recommend sitting at the bar.  they also have very good teppenyaki.  they serve kobe beef teppanyaki.  awesome.  i like the atmosphere.  but not the beeest japanese ive had."
1,"I appreciate when a restauranter ventures to the restaurant waist land of ne mesa to give us a chance to enjoy a better selection of grub. I have been here 4 times now and have experienced a good breakfast with mediocre service to great service and medicore food yester day i had the  wolfpack hashbrowns with 2 eggs and bacon covered with more hashbrowns i requested eggs poached med. they came more to the hard side when one of the employs asked me how my eggs were i said there more to the hard side ,she said   O and walked away  I then asked for a side of holindaise my wait person brought it to me ......cold ....i said can you heat this she of course said no problem .....brought it back an over micro waved sauce that now looked like cottage cheese sent to my table by the (chef???) and delivered by the waitperson  didnt either one of them think lets redo this and not serve a coagulated mess to the customer. i must say the 4 times iv been here theres always been something not quite right from not having change for a $20 to waiting to long for my food  and yesterdays holindaise debacle."
2,"Let me start by saying that if excellent customer service is what you are looking for, this is not the place for you.  Are the waitresses nice?....Sometimes.  Are they efficient?.....Not usually.  Do they get the orders right?.....most of the time.  Do I love this place anyway???.....ABSOLUTELY!  Here's why - \n\nValue of Happy Hour / Reverse Happy Hour / Weekend specials - 5 stars!  There are not many places you can get a slice of pizza, a basket of wings (Golden Medium, yummm) AND a 32 oz frosty beer for about $10 bucks.  They have daily specials, happy hour specials, weekend specials, and late night specials.  If wings are not your thing, try the Monaco Focaccia - it is to die for!\n\nAmbiance - Ehhhh - 3 stars.  This is just your typical sports bar.  No special ambiance to note.  However - bring your shooting skills, and give the arcade game Big Buck Hunter a try for some laughs, OR coerce your friends into playing some pool.\n\nI will concur with previous guests comments that the management at this establishment leaves something to be desired.  I have had several experiences where management failed to provide a service or take care of a customer, and was less than apologetic about their unwillingness to help.\n\nAll in all, I love Zipps - mostly for its convenience and it's cheap prices.  I'd still recommend it though! :)"
0,"I will not be using this company again.  After confirming with the person who answers the phone and schedules the appointments, Jan, that my fee would include the same services as last year's weed control, the service man, Alex, did not complete my lawn application properly.  Because I have health needs, I cannot do the follow up spray with the hose a few days after the application.  In the past, the service has always included the watering as well with no issues.  Apparently the spray wasn't completed at all.  This resulted in more weeds.  I called as soon as I noticed new weeds popping up and Jan assured me that the service man would be by that day to spray again.  I waited and did not hear anything so I called again the next day.  Jan told me there had been an emergency (bees) and he would actually be by the following day instead to spray.  At that point, I assumed it had been done.\n\nOne week later, I notice more weeds and called Jan again.  She told me that Alex had been there and sprayed and she would call him again and follow up.  She called me back shortly after to tell me that she had misinformed me-  he had come by but there were not enough weeds to spray and it was my fault that I had not sprayed the water after the initial service.  She then proceeded to attempt to sell me pest control services and charge me a re-application fee ($40) to come out and spray.  When I told her I could not do the spray myself, she was sarcastic and rude and wanted to know why.  I should not have to disclose my medical information to a pest control company.  I confirmed on the phone before I scheduled the application to avoid that conversation.  I told Jan I would not be paying and asked to speak to her manager.  She said she would have him call me back.  \n\nAn hour later, I received a call from Alex who said because of the miscommunication he would take care of coming and doing a follow-up spray at no cost.  However, he was unable to come for a few more days and the weeds wouldn't die for 7-10 days.  \n\nIt is now a week later and my yard is littered with weeds.  I have also now received a complaint from my HOA.  I will now have to hire an additional service-NOT Apco to fix what they should have addressed from the beginning."
1,"4 stars for the price and location...Had spa suite with incredible view of city center, strip and pool. 0 stars for cleanliness as our room had mold around spa tube and an item I shall not mention stuffed between the couch cushion.  Thank God my wife didn't see it as she would have been physically ill.  We never sat on the couch after that.  Staff was great and very helpful although I have not mentioned our room matters to them yet.  Pool was o.k but cramped and the lazy river was just too small to attempt to navigate the kids on a Thursday afternoon, I'd hate to see it on a weekend.  Very smokey place and just not kept up like it should be."
4,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The spicy chicken bowl is out of this world. I always get just the chicken and white rice (never the veggies). They always give extra terriyaki sauce to put on which makes it even better! The spicy beef is good as well but the chicken is by far my favorite. If youre in a rush call ahead and it is usually ready within 5 minutes. I love how fast they are and friendly. This place is my go to take out when im in a rush and want something delicious.
3,"I've frequent this establishment a couple of times for takeout. Each time I got the hot and sour soup. I decided to dine in tonight because I wasn't feeling well. The restaurant was half full, yet quiet. My hearty shrimp in lobster sauce was delicious and filling. I didn't realize just how hungry I was until I saw the bottom of the dish! \n\nThe staff was very pleasant, but they speak Chinese. I found it difficult to understand them at times. They sent their best English-speaking guy to my table and I was able to order a dish that wasn't on the menu (yay!)."
1,"I was getting my nails done here on Tuesday night, and while my nail lady was fabulous, the ambiance was not. There apparently who is a hairdresser there, Barbara, and she lets her kids run around the entire salon as she works. I think it is highly unprofessional. I was in a complete opposite area of the hair salon, and I could hear the kids. Not to mention, the same lady, was on the phone screaming at someone...also very unprofessional. My nail lady said that was pretty normal and the kids were always at the salon being loud and the mother is very loud herself. I just wanted to relax for an hour or so, and could not do so in that atmosphere. I will not go back, just because I don't want to be bothered with an employees children running around....again....highly unprofessional."
0,"Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service"
0,"I am reluctant to give only one star seeing all the 4-5 stars on Yelp for this place which was what brought me to Los Paisas in the first place. My husband, son and I went Sunday 2pm. The place was packed and we had a short wait. We were very excited to see the place packed translating to a good restaurant and seeing the food being served to other patrons looked delicious. Unfortunately, my $15.99 seafood bouillabaise was terrible because it had 2 small/medium size shrimps, 4 frozen (not fresh) mussels, 2 tiny pieces of fish, 2 small rings (size of nickel and dime) of calamari, 3 crab legs the length and width of my fingers that was fully intacted in the shell (with no means of cracking the legs open). It came in a deceiving big bowl only to have me fish around in the sauce for the seafood. Why do they even bother having this on the menu only to serve frozen mussels and teeny tiny seafood? My husband ordered a cup of coffee which was luke warm he says. He hailed the waiter over and the waiter did remedy this by getting my husband a hotter cup of coffee. I was also excited to try the crispy pork from my husband's plate only to find it really hard to chew. Way over cooked/fried. The place was packed with Colombians so I would think its authentic and good. Don't go by my 1 star and not try this place, just don't order the seafood bouillibaise. Or maybe they just want to serve to Colombians? I'm fine with that. Its too bad we didn't have a good experience cause we are the type that would patronize a restaurant every week if we love it. Other restaurants would be glad to take my money once a week I'm sure."
2,"They have a great reverse happy hour,  10-close every night. Veggie tempura is so yummy and only $4 and the sushi is pretty good.  My favorite is the green tea ice cream!  It is hard to find a place with great green tea ice cream and sushi brokers has it.  \n\nThe cons about this place is the horrible music. They set their music pretty loud too which just makes it worse. Also the service here is extremely slow.  Every time\nI have been there for hh there has only been one server.  It gets pretty busy at this time so I don't understand why they don't get another server.  I get you want tips but the restaurant shouldn't sacrifice the speed of service in order to do that."
0,"Q: What can I say that would make someone who loves Mexican food want to try this place? \n\nA: \""Nada\"" as they say in Spanish. \n\nAnd thats what you get here in the way of great Mexican food. Nothing. As a third generation \""semi-native\"" of Arizona and part Mexican myself, I can say without reservation that the food here is plentiful for all the big eaters out  there but as far as authentic or even flavorful, I would not waste my time. The Taco shells are similar to store bought Ortegas and the beans are no better than canned. All entrees are served in the traditional \""Americanized\"" idea of a Mexican meal. That is to say that everything on the plate runs together and looks like somebody got sick on your plate.\n\nSorry. The only thing that was good here was the wait staff. Very attentive and gracious. One of the things I look for in a Mexican restaurant that gives me a pretty good idea that the food is decent is by how many actual Mexicans are eating there. Shallow perhaps but this place is to authentic Mexican food what Rawhide is to the \""true old west\""."
0,"Terrible.  The place was empty, yet I was served by beer in a HOT glass?  odd.  I ordered beef fajitas, and they were terrible, with much of it being such bad meat it was inedible.  The food was also extremely bland.  I asked for chips and salsa, only to never get any.\n\nIt was terrible, and I wont go back in my travels to Phoenix."
4,"Went back today for lunch. I had the Chicago Italian Beef sandwich. It was fabulous. Had great flavor, crunchy bread. Came with fries and a drink. \nThe sandwich was huge and more fries than one person needs to eat. \nI had half the sandwich and half the fries. Two people could definitely share this. All for 7.50. \nThe lady who works there is so nice. Makes you feel welcome."
2,Lee's sandwiches are lee's sandwiches iam just excited I don't have to drive all the way to China Town to get my Viet Sandwich fix...Yay!!!
4,"I had the Bronzed Catfish and Grits with pork sausage.   It was a wonderful, taste popping meal.   The grits are a restaurant specialty that includes smoked gouda cheese as one of their ingredients.   This place is directly south of the premium outlets.   We stayed parked and walked to Rick's Restorations, which is across the rail tracks from their parking lot.   This restaurant was featured on DDD."
0,"Had to stay here for 16 days with a group of 12, this hotel should not be allowed to use the Best Western name!  All 12 of us had made our reservations in the same week in Nov, all for the same dates, and not one of us had the same rate...then being a military group we had day and night shifts, the free meal coupon could not be used past noon, so half our guys missed out on this, and the management would not make an exception, they said it would mess up their paperwork and require extra work, so they opted to stick it to the Soldiers.   \n\nSo on to the rooms, they where all newer furnishings, but all where pretty filthy, things like hairs everywhere, and food particles on the floor.   It took over a week to get mine vacuumed properly!  The rooms all have large gaps around the doors and little bugs are common, they also have little window unit AC and heat that kind of works.  But, the best part is the shower, when you first turn it on the water is brown, no BS, and after that clears it won't stay hot, goes hot cold, hot cold...this place is a joke, and It gets better, so to see if I can get a hot something I fill the tub (after the brown clears) and come back to it after a few minutes, well now the water is full of pebbles and dirt.  I confirmed with the others in our group and this was standard for all rooms.\n\nOverall worst hotel I've ever stayed in, even if your just passing through I would highly advise going a bit further to Casa Grande, Goodyear, or Yuma depending on your direction.  Plus it's a very expensive hotel, $99-129 a night is the norm.\n\nI wish again they had a zero star on yelp for this place!"
0,"As a fellow CheeseSteak Lover, I have to try it when I see it on the menu.\n\nNot a fan here.  First, if you want me to come back, Why do you nickel and dime me as a customer?  That's just bad business.  $15 for my meal?  It's fast food!\n\nAnyway, I'll sum it up...  No thanks."
1,"This is NOT the place to go for your lunch hour. They are incredibly slow and they really don't care that they are. We were not ready to order when the waitress asked us the first time so she said she would come back in a few minutes. Yeah, more like 20 minutes!! \n\nI ordered the new bacon, mushroom and onion skillet and I loved it. It has an Alfredo sauce over potatoes, grilled mushrooms & onion, bacon and cheddar cheese. I know it sounds like a heart attack on a plate but it was so good. I had a blueberry muffin also and it came out hot with butter on the side. \n\nAlthough I was very pleased with the meal the reason I am giving such a low rating is for the service. I ran out of water and was looking for my waitress to ask for more. It took a really long time for her to show up again. It also took more than a half an hour for our food to come out of the kitchen after we ordered. With only an hour for lunch that is unacceptable."
2,"Four friends and I had lunch here today. Gave it three stars for my absolutely out of this world French onion soup, and my friends'  Thai salad, Cobb salad, and Reuben sandwich which they all said was superb. My fish and chips however left a lot to be desired. The fish was mushy and flavorless and had a rancid taste.  Sent it back.  Great coffee , excellent service.  \nFrench onion soup is $11 here which is way overpriced for onion soup but have to admit it was absolutely delicious!!"
4,"Oh...my...lanta! I can't believe I haven't visited this little gem sooner! It's nestled atop a Pei Wei and Starbucks so I wasn't sure what to expect.  But from the moment I walked up the dimly light stairway and into the bar, I knew it was going to be a great night.  So first off, they open at 4 and happy hour is until 7pm.  (20% off everything on Sundays!!). They have a huge selection of different booze and brews and their specialty cocktails are definitely something that sets them apart from other bars.  I loves me some Moscow Mule, so when I saw that they had one on the menu (in a real copper mug!!) I ordered one immediately.  It was so tastilicious that I had to order a second.  For my next drink, I tried the Retro Cooler, which in my opinion, is as cool as it gets...think Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused.  It's a mix of St. Germaine (Elderflower liquer) with Champagne and a lemon twist.  It went down the ole' hatch super easy, though, so be careful!  The second time I enjoyed this bar I ordered the White Rabbit (no...it's not vegan and they don't have a milk substitute...I cheated!)  It has Godiva White Chocolate liquer, horchata, stoli vanilla and some other yumness.  This one tasted like candy and I drank it in about five seconds.  Anyway, besides the drinks, they also have a few light snacks like hummus, artichoke dip, etc.  The vibe in this place is super chill and I really dig the way the bar is set up; the backdrop has big circle cutouts with yellow lights behind. There are comfy couches and high top tables and of course seats at the bar.  I almost felt like I was going to see Shane and Alice from the L Word walk in.  On our last visit, it was pretty busy as it was a holiday weekend and there was a dj.  The people of SideBar definitely know what they're doing and I will certainly be back!"
2,"Great place for the price. Not the most luxurious place on the strip but the amenities are decent, the service is good, and the location is fantastic. Very good value overall.\n\nThis is the 4th or 5th time we've stayed here. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and there is a decent selection of food downstairs ranging from McDonald's to 5 star French, and everything in between. The casino floor is a bit small and smoky, but perfect for when you're not in the mood to get dressed up and go out. The spa is small and reasonably priced. And it's only a few minutes' walk to other casinos, restaurants, and shopping at the many malls nearby.\n\nThe only things we didn't care much for were the showers (high pressure mist that's definitely not my idea of pleasant) and on our most recent trip the TV didn't work properly (but we didn't call to have it fixed because it just wasn't that important to us).\n\nYes, you can stay at a nicer, trendier, and/or more luxurious place on the strip but you'll pay about twice as much. We prefer to stay here, where we're always satisfied, and use the cash we saved to eat, play, and party while we're in town."
4,"Awesome loose leaf tea spot in the North Phoenix area. You can have a cup/pot of tea in-house, or buy a variety of teas to go.\n\nHUGE selection of loose leaf teas. If you're a tea fan, a visit to Souvia is a must-do."
0,"We've lived here for a year now and are NOT resigning. The unsatisfactory posts are all accurate for the majority of people who live/lived here. When we first moved in we also had a cockroach infestation.. The place was trashed (coloring crayons all over the walls, back patio, kitchen). Mold was covered in our toilets and showers, the sinks were clogged with hair and other disgusting particles. The dryer had not been cleaned out leaving a HUGE fire hazard had we not caught it. On top of that, many drawers were broken and when we asked maintenance to come fix them it took almost a month. \n\nAbout 2 months in to our lease, our washer broke. It took 3 weeks to get a new one. Four months later our dryer broke. We contacted the front office about it for THREE MONTHS until someone came. Even when they came they didn't fix it and left mess. A month after the mess, and a few more complaints, we finally got it fixed. \n\nFinally, this past week our A/C went out. Our roommate called the office while we were out of town to get it fixed. When we came home it was still out and had to call again to get it fixed. Two days later, we woke up sweating with no air because the maintenance did a half ass job (as always). \n\nAbove all the horrible customer service and lack of taking care of tenants, the community constantly smells like marijuana, is not secure (two locked bikes of ours were stollen) and filled with very rude people and staff. Although this place looks nice and is in a \""quiet\"" location, your money will be much better spent elsewhere."
3,"Friend and I were headed to work and she suggested Gandolfo's for breakfast, now I love little deli shops and was up to trying something new. So off to Gandolfo's I went, already knew what we were ordering so I just ordered when I got there, after I did that I looked up at the menu on the wall and thought dang I need to come back sometime and try a sandwich for lunch. I told the owner this is my 1st time here, he looked shocked and said how did you know what you wanted to ordered, just figured you to be a regular,  I told him I did research before I got there. Too funny.   Got the Huevos Locos, which is sausage, eggs, pepper jack cheese, and salsa on a roll. OMG it was soo dang good!!!!  I saw they have a sandwich called the Rockefeller Ruben, that has corned beef or pastrami on it and its been calling my name, got to try it out soon!!!!"
4,"I don't even know where to start. So here it goes. I had a really tough night and decided the next morning I would get my hair done. So I wake up early in the morning and call the salon where I was greeted by a very friendly guy that assured me I could get my hair done that same day! I was so relieved because I really wanted to treat myself to something nice. And after seeing all the reviews I decided to try this place out. When I walked in I was greeted by the receptionist and he was very kind! The outlook of this place was really cool too. Then I got greeted by my stylist. She asked me what I wanted to do today and I told her highlights. Long story short, between the iced tea, the massage, and the amazing stylist by the name of Bailey, I had an absolutely amazing day. And my hair turned out amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone (:"
3,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! WE picked up a Groupon and decided to check this place out. I'm all for a new Mexican restaurant and Rita's did NOT disappoint! It's right off the I-10 at 35th ave, super easy to get to. We started with the table side Guacamole, which was perfect! two HUGE avocados and super fresh chips. The house salsa was also perfect! The next dish we got was the seafood cocktail de molcatejes (sp?) Talk about a humongoid bowl of awesomeness! (See the pic I posted). it was full of shrimp, octopus, scallops and fresh veggies ($20). I went with this mixed grill Plate, that had pork, beef and chicken with griled veggies and peppers! Thsi thing came out still sizzling on a huge platter! Talk about wow factor! Tehy have a seafood version for a few bucks more, definitely a killer dish. All in all, the food  was fantastic, the service was awesome and we'll for sure be back!"
3,"This place is definitely not your run-of-the-mill movie theater, nestled in a night club.... but what the hell? Why not?\n\nClean, comfortable, fun, and great movie selections.  Definitely more expensive than the average theater... but the seats are twice the size and you can pick your seats in advance.  You also have the option for more than just mediocre movie food + full bar."
0,"Eek! Methinks not indeed. Is this place for you? Here's a checklist. If you like plates fresh out of the dishwasher that are still hot with crusted food on them, and this was with multiple plates, this is your buffet. If you are extremely sodium deficient this is your buffet. If you like carved meats that make you wish for a meat tenderizer to beat them with this is your buffet. If you like semi-frozen out of the box desserts this is definitely your buffet. Go slow on your drinks as getting a server to refill it is next to impossible. When you walk in there are Zagat rated signs on the wall, with all due respect this place isn't worthy of being rated by Zagat. Your best bet is to stay on Boulder Highway and find someplace else to eat. One positive was the stir fry station manned by competent and friendly staff. It's the only thing that warrants a star."
3,"I was a huge fan of the Avalon in Oakland a couple years so when I passed this in Mt Lebo I had to stop! \n\nDesign: Eye catching, funky clothes in the windows, neon sign\n\nOrganization: Typical layout of most buy trade sell shops. Pants. Shirts. Dresses...yada yada.  Nice area upfront with bags and jewelry. There is also a higher end selection( Prada, Gucci, Jimmy Cho) for the desperate housewives of Mt. Lebo. \n\nSelection: Pretty good. Buffalo Exchange has a more stylish/funky selection though. Wide Shoe Selection. \n\nPrice: Affordable \n\nService: Cashier was nice. We briefly chatted about our favorite stores. \n\n\nPros: Doesn't smell like cat pee which most resell shops tend to. Very Organized and great design. Very Affordable ( Tank $8.00 and Dress $8.00) \n\nCons: Could use to clear out some inventory ( old Hollister tanks, plaid short short from '98). Whiney mid-aged women shop here. \n\nOverall: Great place to stop when you have no money but still have the itch to spend and need a break from the Urban Outfitters circuit. Definitely plan on making this a constant in my shopping rounds.  \n\nCheck it out!"
4,"Four Peaks has been the setting for a good amount of cheery drunken debauchery.\n\nMy brother's patronize this spot so frequently you could swear the Prohibition was coming again.\n\nAwesome beer is served at a bar setup that is conducive to good flow and meeting new people.\n\nI'm a big fan of the Peach Ale- it's the girliest of the beers. 8th Street Ale is also good. As is the Sunbru.\n\nFor lunch, try one of the beer breads. The bread itself is awesome... similar to a flatbread or pita. Great texture, great flavor. Trust me, it'll fill you up for $9.\n\nMeet somebody at Four Peaks and grab a beer. You'll be so glad that you did."
3,The Artisan Burger with jalape\u00f1o bacon is the bomb.  Bartenders are fast and friendly
3,"Union Grill was a 10 minute walk from where I lived and this place was a frequent stop for dinner on Sundays and Saturdays. They usually don't have a long wait if you don't have a reservation and the staff is really friendly and checks up on you frequently. \n\nI usually only got the Rich Boy sandwich. Ciabatta bread loaded with shrimp, celery and some other stuff. My friends and I would usually all order this because it tasted like Heaven. I have tried the crab cake sandwich which isn't too bad but it is not as good as the Rich Boy. I did start getting the crab cakes as an appetizer though. For the fries, make sure you get the waffle fries. They are absolutely delicious and complement the sandwiches completely. I have also tried the buffalo chicken salad with blue cheese dressing which is topped with waffle fries and that too is also terrific. However, If you want a good sandwich, get the Rich Boy. Best shrimp sandwich out there."
0,"We planned my daughters 21 st birthday here.  We used a Vip service. There was 20 of us.  The doormen never let my daughter in and we were all upstairs waiting for her.  on Halloween they wouldn't let her in with her costume, a teddy bear..???...\nIf you want to get pick pocketed go to this club!  They took it from his front pocket ! There is a pro crew running with the management , they are letting these crooks in. As if it wasn't expensive enough !  $2000.00. For four bottles....  it gets WORSE...\nDon't take your wallet ! They charge for water too !  With table service ... Arghhhhh a horrible and very dangerous venue... You Cant get out, only down one stair case you have to get down three flights of stairs with 5,000 others.  They know about the pick pocketing and they are still letting them in. They said our wallet will show up in the morning when they clean up .... No.     I met another victim at the airport too, also identity theft. Credit card fraud. No ID either what a hassle at the airport.  \nTao RUINED  our trip..."
1,"We had one thing in mind when we entered Kahunaville, drinks. I had some expired Travelzoo vouchers and I was pleased with how easy it was to use them for the price I paid, not always the case. The drinks and service, however, left something to be desired.\n\nPart of this was our fault, we were not really feeling the crazy, fruity, enormous cocktails. But I had heard their bartenders had won awards and such, so I figured a basic Manhattan would not be a problem. I was wrong. It wasn't disgusting, but it took some work to get it down. After that, we switched to frozen margaritas, which were far better. I would have gone with 3 stars, but the service was just plain bad. We were sitting at the bar, but were often forgotten and the time between drinks was just not OK. We likely would have had another drink or two in the same amount of time had we been given the chance. But we had somewhere to be, so we left with only a mild buzz and feeling pretty happy to get out of there. \n\nUnder different circumstances, like a drunken bar crawl, I'm sure I might have had more fun. Fairly certain I will not come here again."
0,"Very disappointed. I've recently moved to Phoenix from So. Cal. and was really missing some good Chinese Food. This place is right next door so we thought we would try it out. They deliver, so that was pretty convenient, but my food was disgusting. I ordered orange chicken, pretty basic, if a Chinese food joint and can't make good orange chicken, I doubt any of the other dishes are any good. The sauce on my chicken was neon orange, almost glowing. It was just disgusting. Too Sweet, slimy and just gross."
3,"What is there really to say about Roberto's that's new? Most people know about the chain by now. But I will note two things:\n\n1) Many of the stores have slight variations on their specials menu so it's always worth checking out.\n\n2) Just from personal experience, while their menu is standardized, I tend to stick to older locations. Maybe it's all in my head, but the food just seems cheesier and more delicious at the older locations in town versus the super-sleep looking newer ones. Then again, maybe I am a sucker for spots that let their food do the talking versus using decor to convince you that things are better than they are in reality."
2,"Food was good at best, they serve alcohol but there's no scene, no outside seating, and uncomfortable seating."
2,"Half portions of pasta make for a great dinner without being stuffed.  Travel to Charlotte fairly often for dinner, Aria is a reliable restaurant for a good dinner, nice wine selection, and overall good value.\n\nI would recommend dining here, especially if you are dining alone and still want a nice restaurant."
4,"In my opinion, this is by far the best Sushi and Japanese joint in town!  This place is as authentic as you can get for Phoenix, AZ.  My husband and I are addicted to the Chirachi bowl which is packed full of rice, seaweed, and piled high with the chef's selection of the freshest raw fish.  This incredible bowl of deliciousness is $20!  You couldn't find this much fresh raw fish at a restaurant for this price anywhere else in Phoenix.  \n\nIf I get the Chirachi bowl idea stuck in my head, I have to have it and nothing else will satisfy my craving.  Speaking of...I think I'll order one for take out right now!  ;)\n\nI rate Sushi Ken at the highest rating possible: 5 Noms: \""Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom, & NOM!\"" :D"
0,"OK, First thing first: It takes forever to see your doctor. Our shortest wait was 1 hour. It usually takes about 2 hours to see your doc. Be prepared to kill your precious time in the office. The nurses are nice and friendly, but cannot say the same for the office staff! \n\nAlthough we saw Dr. Fleisher regularly throughout the pregnancy, we didn't get him for the delivery. Instead, and UNFORTUNATELY, we had Dr. REBECCA TYRE who was on call for the delivery. In all fairness, we knew from the onset that getting Dr. Fleisher was not guaranteed and that we could get any of the six doctors for the delivery. And we had hoped that it would be OK to have someone other than Dr. Fleisher for the delivery as we had developed a good relationship with him. \n\nNow, the perplexing thing is not that we had a HORRIFYING and TRAUMATIZING experience with DR. TYRE, but that it is almost an established fact that DR. TYRE universally and repeatedly gets bad reviews! And please go check as many webmd reviews as you wish! She is unacceptably unprofessional. Now my question is to the office, Green Valley OB GYN: Why do you still have TYRE on board despite the fact that she has an established track record of traumatizing your patients??? It is such a shame when her own colleagues from the same office badmouth her practice and professionalism big time, yet still keep her there and allow her to ruin people's most important and emotional moments... \n\nNow please read our personal experience with Tyre below if you think that I am a little too harsh and decide for yourself...\n\nWhen Tyre came in to the delivery room at St. Rose Dominican Hospital, she didn't even bother to greet us! First thing we heard from her was \""where are you from?\"" We knew that it wasn't going to be a pleasant experience, but she was on call that night! In only 15 minutes, she was able to traumatize us big time and to completely ruin the most magical and memorable moment of our life. Our daughter was born with a minor birth defect and Tyre broke it to us in an extremely unprofessional way. She looked at our baby and said \""what is wrong with this baby? Take \""it\"" and check \""it\""!\"" She didn't even let us enjoy our baby for one moment, shed happy tears, or celebrate the arrival of our precious angel. Then, of course, we completely freaked out, trying to figure out what was going on, but she refused to elaborate anything, stating that it wasn't her job to diagnose the newborn! \n\nA heartless and unprofessional woman, a monumental shame to her profession! She should not be involved with childbirth, one of the most emotional and magical human experiences ever. She is an arrogant doctor, and a horrible, ugly human being...Stay away from her, and from this office if possible..."
0,"Das Ambiente ist sehr sch\u00f6n. Beim Preis-Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis liegt der Schwerpunkt eindeutig beim Preis. Samstag Abend um 19 Uhr waren die Men\u00fcvorschl\u00e4ge der Karte nicht mehr(?) zu bekommen. \nDas \u00dcberraschungsmen\u00fc bestand aus einem B\u00fcffelmozzarella mit gew\u00f6hnlichem gekochten(!!?) Schinken, anschlie\u00dfend gab es vier ! ganze Gnocci an Tr\u00fcffelsauce auf seeeeehr gro\u00dfem Teller. Lecker aber sehr wenig.

2,"Average food on a very limited menu.  Service was barely adequate, and the prices were very over-priced.  Location is convenient, but parking can be an issue.  Seems to be very popular with the trendy high school crowd [something I shied away from even when I was in high school]..."
1,"People love this place.  I am just not a fan of their pizza.  Then again, I am an ex-New Yorker!"
0,"Had a reservation for 5 for 6:30 pm.  We arrived and within 5 min were seated.  It was Friday night and it was totally packed and about 50 people hanging in the foyer and out the front door waiting for seating.  The noise level was UNBEARABLE.  I could not hear my husband talking to me and he was right next to me.  The people at the next table were trying to talk but had to yell and they did...non stop...as were everyone in the restaurant.  We were waiting for our other guests but could not take it anymore and gave up our table, called our guests who were just getting out of their car and told them to meet us at Twin Creek that this place was not acceptable to a social evening.  What a shame...it is so beautiful inside.  We have only dined for Brunch outside in their really nice patio...and for that experience I would give it 5 stars...but definitely not the place for a social Friday night .....at least inside the restaurant...outside it was pouring rain, so not an option."
3,"Exellant food! Inexpensive lunch buffet ( like 8.95). Friendly staff. Best beans and rice anywhere! Not much more to ask for. Food portions are inconsistant, I think it depends on who's cooking."
4,"In the days where Starbucks is all the rage, I am excited to find a local business that is really delicious. I love their selection of beverages, which are all at a great price point. I don't drink coffee or tea, but they made the drinks work for me. \nI really enjoyed the breakfast bagel I had, it was very filling. I am not a sweets person but they have LOADS of sweet treats. Only disappointment was when I went to order soup because I like to eat savory food and that was it on their menu, they were out of everything. \nBUT I  guess it left me wanting more because I will definitely be back to get some! \nI recommend making it your new coffee spot."
4,YES YES!  Do wish they brought back the jalapeno mashed potatoes! But every time they rock my world with the goto FISH TACO!!!!!
4,Great ambience. Great drinks. Great food. I love this place!
1,"The waiter was nice and very friendly tonight. The bread and salad was good. But the linguini and clams was kinda gross. It was nothing new. The sauce tasted plain and the clams were already on the noodles. It's more spontaneous when you can open the clams yourself. The sauce was also really thick. If it was thinner it would have been better. The cheesecake was alright. I've had better and the portion is really small. I looked at it and said are you kidding me? It was like a \""fun size\"" but I was looking for the king size cheesecake. Other than that I don't think I'll be back."
0,"Worst service ever!  Came in at 9:20pm and as soon as we walked in the manager told us take out only!  I asked why when it clearly states on the door they don't close until 10:00.  He told me it's because he wanted to get out early.  WHAT THE FUCK?!?  I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.  So rude.  He even chuckled as he said it.  Going to call the owner tomorrow, but honestly if he hired someone like this to manage his restaurant I'd be surprised if he even cared."
2,"Sushi Mon isn't bad, but I'd rather go to Oyshi or Yama. The selection of food is not as great as either Oyshi or Yama for all you can eat. However, I like that they have daily specials. Often times, Sushi Mon offers toro, which is not offered at many other AYCE sushi places. The staff is friendly, the bathroom clean, and the food fresh.\n\nTip: don't forget to ask for the stamp card. After enough all you can eat stamps, you get one free."
1,I would have giving another star if the burgers were cooked correctly. I think if mostly all you do is burgers they should be cooked the way you asked for and we were the only table they were cooking for at the time. We ordered two burgers and asked for one medium rare and the other medium. The medium rare one came out rare. The medium one came out medium well. So both of us were slightly disappointed but being one off we could manage and didn't want to waste time having one thrown back on. \n\nThe burger I had seemed to be seasoned nice with a slight charr. About half the people are like me and will only eat half the roll because that's too much bread to eat. I thought the house made garlic knot was good and not too garlicky with the burger. (but I only ate the smaller half not the whole roll) But my companion eat the whole thing and said all together it was too much garlic so it can go either way.\n\nThe truffle string fries are OK but don't didn't taste truffles on our visit. Maybe they left it off or maybe they use real truffle oil that's very delicate? Usually if you taste a lot of truffle flavor it's artificial truffle aroma. So that may be a good thing that we didn't taste the truffle.\n\nWe both had margaritas and I'd pass on them them next time as they were large and too much mixer in proportion to booze.\n\nTwo burgers that came with the fries and two margaritas about $40.00 before tip.
3,Happy hour for drinks. Nice ambience and super customer service and Salt fish fritter! I didn't give 5 star due to not trying actual food. But great overall
4,"Amazing south Indian/Sri Lankan food. I've been going here for 10+ years, and quality has been consistently good. Ambience is not much, but much more relaxed and spaced out than a typical hole in the wall. Place is equally busy with take-out and dine-in crowd, take out crowd is primarily local Sri Lankan, which speaks to the authenticity of the place.\n\nFood is super cheap, and volume is so much that no one leaves hungry. For less than 10$ one could have a 3 course meal (app, main and tea). All the typical curries are on the menu, but go for Dosas( various kinds), ildli, kuttu roti( beware the heat factor, not for ones with fragile stomachs), string hoppers( crushed rice noodle lumps), poori masala( ask for substituting masala with Chana) and Medu wadas are to die for.\n\nIf you crave for heat in blistery Montreal winter, Jolee definitely makes the cut."

0,"I arrived for a simple pedi/mani, everyone was friendly but the end result was horrible. I picked 2 different colors one for my toes and one for my fingernails. When I got home, every single one of my fingernails were lumpy, what seemed like air bubbles, and my toe nails didn't have an even coat of nail polish. \nThe next day I went back and the nail artist decided to give me multiple reasons why the nail polish was lumpy, instead of just apologizing. I ended up asking for a simple French tip with clear coat.\nAnd to sum up my experience, once the French mani was complete, the reasoning for the lumpiness was their clear top coat.\nNever coming back here !"
4,"We got a in-home free consulting and same day installation. The rates are competitive, and for the service provided, we would recommend choosing JPG  over the other giant companies. Feels good to know our home is secure."
1,First time I tried.  It was awesome. But this time it is actually not good.  They also increase the price for 4th July holiday. But the food was worse. Oysters were not fresh. King crabs are small.  We were really disappointed. For almost $70 a person. Totally not worth it. Stay away for good.
0,"This place obviously changed their hours and didn't update anything else except the door on their business. Last time I came by, they were closed randomly. Ok, I understand things happen and it's necessary. No problem. However, now they are closed on Sundays and didn't bother to update their answering service or information online. Annoying."
0,"Rooms are great but the front desk is terrible. Front desk was slow and not organized and charged my credit card for charges that were not mine.  Clearing it up with the was a nightmare.  The valet parking is also a nightmare.  They need to incorporate self parking because they don't have the staff to handle weekend nights.  \n\nI made a reservation at Fiamma, an MGM restaurant and asked the front desk for their phone number because i wanted to cal the restaurant to let them  know we were running ten minutes late and they didn't have the number and gave me much attitude about. \n\nAgain, rooms are great but the front desk and valet parking make the stay not worth it."
1,"I saw this show a few years ago.  There were a few illusions that I really liked and scratched my head and wondered how.  For the most part however, I found the show somewhat boring.   I also immensely dislike ANY performer who needs to have his parents stand up and get applause.  In this case, Copperfield's parents were in the audience.  They deserved as much applause as I did for sitting through the show.\n\nThere was one illusion--and I know that's what it is--illusion, but it was totally ruined for me.  It's the locked box one where he predicts before the show what random people will say as a number.  I know the box is switched.  I don't know how, but when you do an illusion and you have someone write down numbers that get put in the box in the switch, have them write the numbers the same way you do, David.  Make sure you don't write 4 like that and the other person backstage write it the more common way we almost all write a four.  This error just ruined the whole thing for me and I walked away shaking my head wondering why I had wasted my money on this show."
0,This place has gone down hill in the past couple of years. Corporate has changed the quality of their pasta in order to save money. The only thing that really tasted good was the cheese bread. I haven't been back since.

1,I bought a groupon to try this place out.  I'm not impressed with the wait as I was told half hour and it's been over an hour.  And there were upcharges.  Surprise.....so my 35 dollar oil change and car wash turned into an extra 32 dollars.  Won't be back.  The help was nice but still not returning.
2,"I used to not like this place, but I read they changed everything. The Now use these amazing organic cibatta rolls and have removed the High Fructose corn syrup from everything!!! The also are the first restaurant to take it upon themselves to remove trans fat form 100% of everything sold there!. The Royal with light mustard is super good and I usually just switch any of the sandwiches for turkey and ham if I only like the toppings. \n\nIt has totally improved and I come here often now. Oh and I read a review that said you get Soft serve with any meal? Is that true? Why did I not know that?\n\nI would give them an extra star but they have a lesbian that works there that is thinner than me, jk ....but there is"
0,"I am a real customer here and yelp removed my previous review saying that it \""lacks a firsthand customer experience at this location\""... can you believe that??! How the hell can yelp tell me that this was not a first hand experience?!\n\nA repeat of my review about my FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE here at Giadas:\nI'm basing this review solely on the grossly overpriced menu. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants and steakhouses in the US and none of them come close to the outrageous prices charged at Giadas. I'm all for paying good money for a meal, but $75 for a bone in ribeye or $35+ for a plate of pasta portioned the size of an appetizer (just look at some of the pictures) is just absurd.\n\nSure, it's a good steak.... that's right.. I ATE IT!! But it's not even close to justifying its price. I'm pretty much disappointed with almost all the food network star restaurants and Giadas has managed to make it to the top of the list. All these guys cross promote each other to fuel their own pockets. Way to ride the fame bandwagon and lure people in with your TV name. Shame on you. \n\nMore detail about MY FIRST HAND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. They have a seating area overlooking the strip. The kitchen is right out in the open for a \""showy\"" atmosphere. The Hostesses where grey heels with short white friffy dresses that have holes in them. There was a 30 minute wait last Saturday afternoon and we didn't even have to make a reservation to get a seat. We had a $14 arugula salad, I ate a bone in Ribeye with a egg on-top of it sprinkled with arugula and my friend had the lemon pasta which came with two prawns and looked like an appetizer. Side of lemon potatoes and the Tiramisu which came in a tiny shot glass and an espresso to finish off our underwhelming meal. I drank coke, she had a fancy drink.. the total came out right under $200. Everything tasted good... not amazing... will I write about how I felt about each and every item?? No... because explanation can justify being reamed not only in price.. but portions as well. I've paid good money for great food.. but I've never seen outrageous prices unless it was a special day like V-Day... in which case I guess we can justify paying $100+ a person... for a filling meal at least.\n\nWe went to Gordon Ramsays Steak the night after and had a wonderful and FILLING meal for two for less than$140. Portions were larger and we even had leftovers... Something I couldn't imagine happens a lot here at Giadas.\n\nGIADAS IS A PAID YELP ADVERTISER. They made a complaint to remove my legitimate negative review about a REAL experience here at Giadas. How can you say I didn't eat here when I know what their food tastes like and that they serve measily portions for top shelf prices. We left hungry and spent a couple hundred for a meal for two."
4,"Is it possible to fall in love with your esthetician ? I think YES! My mother is an esthetician of 20 years and I had never let anyone touch my eye brows except her. Well I moved to Vegas and needed to find someone! Badly! (3 months YIKES!) \n\n I couldn't be more happier that I have found  Stacey. What an amazing spirit she has! She examined my thick eyebrows, asked about skin sensitivity, and actually got to know my taste before waxing. I've never felt so comfortable. \n\nHonestly I loved my results more than my mothers. (Ssssh) I had no redness or irritation, and I have extremely fair and sensitive skin. She finished me with an SPF powder and we chatted for a few minutes before leaving. \n\nStacey makes you feel like a friend, not a client. I couldn't be happier for trusting her with my eye brows.

I was not groped.  I won't say if I groped anyone.\n#7  I was locked out of my room for 90 minutes due to a lock malfunction, even security could not get in.\n#8  I was locked out of my room again for 60 minutes for the same reason.\n#9  When I decided to upgrade to the sky suites I was assigned a room that did not exist causing me to shlep my bags up and down the hallway to the point of sweat running down my neck.  This one is classic.  Not sure why certain room number didn't exist but they don't.  How could they assing one?  Another mystery?\n#10  upon seeking ice I found my floors ice machine did not work\n#11  upon checking other floors I found their ice machines did not work.\n#12  upon ordering ice from room service I was delivered 2 empty buckets.\n#13  upon ordering room service food I was delivered an incorrect order with missing items/accompaniments with two additional empty buckets.\n#14  I somehow ended up with two more empty ice bucket in the middle of the night for a total of 7 ice buckets.\n#15  The room service guy could not turn on my ice machine in my bar fridge.\n#16  In the morning when I called for room service tray pickup and ice again I waited over 2 hrs 15min and the dude showed up empty handed.  Not even a tray or cart to remove the dishes.....HUH?\n#17  I asked the housekeeping supervisor not to clean my room at all the given day because I had numerous personal glassware items out for a scotch tasting party which I didn't want getting \""bussed\"".\n#18  despite my request a housekeeper was in my room upon my return for the party.\n#19  I woke up freezing in the middle of the night as the housekeeper doing turndown had taken and not replaced my comforter.  I stumbled in late and passed out and assumed I'd kicked the blanket to the floor, when I finally had the energy/awareness to look for it I realized I was sleeping with a thin sheet, no comforter in the whole room!\n#20  When I called for a comfortor no one came until the random housekeeper coming to clean my room.  I asked her for a comforter and a guy brought me a scragly rag that didn't match the set and was NO WHERE NEAR as nice as the comforter I had originally.\n#21  While playing $75/hand blackjack I was told i would not be comped cigarettes, but not only did I need to pay for them, I needed to pay in 8 single $1 bills due to the cocktail waitress needing to buy them from a machine.\n#22  At the buffet I got one drink right when I sat down and sat 20 min with an empty diet coke.\n#23  At the Cafe my waiter went on break and I waited forever for my check, the food also sucked.\n#24  Another time I ordered room service the food was very cold.  I'm not picky, lukewarm is fine.  It was cold.\n#25  When I checked in it took forever, the lady had never \""done\"" something involved with my checkin.\n#26  When I toured the spa they told me only daily passes were available, yet I later found out 3-day passes were available.  Every time I checked in, just using gym and wet areas, it took forever.\n#27  When I hit a hand-pay jackpot on a machine it took forever to get paid, and then I didn't even get cash, I got a TITO I had to take to the cage.  I ended up getting to meet about 6 supervisors while they figured it out though.\n\n\nOk so I ended up just saying eff it and checking out a day early for the so called 5-Star Sky Suites Luxury section of the Aria Hotel.

0,"Very poor communication. I have been coming to Dr. Copus for years due to her close proximity to my house and ease of scheduling an appointment online, but will not be coming back after my last experience here. I was not informed of medication side effects, and she has changed her story about what was said in my appointment for recommended treatment. Her assistant is a completely pompous half-wit. I had to e-mail the doctor to actually talk to her - two weeks after my appointment. Don't come here!"
4,"In my quest to check out all Japanese markets in the greater Las Vegas area, I just happen to see this on my nearby search feature on my phone.\n\nLocated in a nice plaza off of Eastern Avenue, this place is just to the right of Monta. I love these quaint little markets because they give you that cozy feeling. Probably because these places are mom and pop owned. Plus supporting your local business is always a good thing.\n\nAs I went in, I am greeted in Japanese by what I assume was one of the owners in the form of a nice old lady. The first thing I looked for was any Kit Kat flavors I havnt tried yet. All they had were the dark chocolate ones. I asked the lady when they get new flavors and all she could tell me was that they are mostly seasonal. \n\nAs I walked around, I noticed a lot of common Japanese staples you would find at other places. For this place I noticed they had all sorts of different kinds of sushi in the refrigerated section. This was something I havnt seen at other Japanese markets or maybe I just wasn't looking hard enough.\n\nSo in my ever growing discovery of Japanese markets, this place is very similar to all the others that I have encountered and will stop by any time I am in the area.\n\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #11"
2,"Eh... I'm glad I was drunk. \nHOWEVER\n\nWhat is up with the rude ass bouncers?? I don't know if it was because Paul Pierce was at the club so security was heightened or if they're just plain jerks but this is what happened.\n\nSome nitwit thought it would smart to have VIP sections on the four corners of the dance floor in the main room. The VIP sections are just roped off so when it's extremely crowded, people may overstep the rope or fall into it. \n\nWELL. We got invited into the VIP but the bouncer wouldn't let. WTF? And then on top of that, it was extremely crowded so we were getting pushed this way and that, right, left, up, down, sideways, and the security guards had the fucking nerve to SHOVE US and YELL. \n\nTerrible rude ass people.. FUCK YOU.\n\n\nHowever, the doorman that was giving us drink tickets all night is cool.. Unlimited drink bracelets are the shiieet and plus this place was bigger than LAX so it was a little more enjoyable..\n\nBut those bouncers need to check themselves."
1,"Lucca is a small vibrant resto located in the heart of Little Italy so you'd expect them to nail it. As soon as you arrive they start you off with a complimentary order of bruchetta which is excellent and a very nice touch. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered the Buffalo Mozzarella, made with beautiful fresh ingredients, it was amazing. I suggest that you ask them to add a bit of balsamic to the dish, a reliable source tells me that the previous chef use to serve it this way. We also ordered the calamari, which was very disappointing. I love calamari and I didn't even finish the plate. Wow, I can't believe that there was calamari in front of me and I didn't eat it! It was very chewy and not enjoyable, it tasted like something you'd pickup at the food court. \n\nFor our main course my wife had the filet mignon and I had the lobster pasta. The filet was uninspiring and a bit salty and the lobster pasta evening more disappointing. The pasta was served with a lobster bisque for the sauce, a well done lobster bisque is one of my favorite things. Unfortunately this was very bland and uninteresting. The pieces of lobster in the pasta were few and far between. \n\nFor dessert I had the chocolate lava cake.Chocolate cake is one of my favorite things on earth. Again this dish lacked flavour and any sort of punch or excitement. \n\nOverall I must say the meal was very uninspiring and with so many other great options available I will not be back to Lucca any time soon."
1,"Various friends of mine have told me that Cosi makes good sandwiches, but at best, I find it mediocre. Not that they're bad sandwiches, but I feel that they lack a bit of character and taste -- The sandwiches I've had just seemed too cooked and also seemed to be lacking a bit of a fresh/raw element as well as a couple condiments. I also find them a bit too tiny for the price. Ah well."
2,"Even though they've raised their price a buck...at $4.99 Badgers build your own burger is still a tasty bargain. My son and I had the burger..wife had a BLT. all gave it high grades. feel as though we got a flavor of the real las Vegas...not some cookie cutter chain deal. There are some \""sketchy\"" characters patronizing this spot...but overall its a solid thumbs up. Service was fine...food was good...and the price is right!"
1,"Me and my boyfriend went here for dinner last night because I had a Chinese food craving and thought it would be good to try something new. Honestly, I wasn't impressed at all. Forget hitting the spot, the food here didn't even get anywhere near the spot.\nFirstly, the place is pretty small and has a rather weird layout. We were seated at a table near the bar and man, did the sound of the bartender shaking up drinks get annoying! It was so loud that I had trouble hearing my boyfriend a couple times.\nNo sooner were we seated than the waitress asked us if we wanted to start off with any appetizers. I mean, at least give us a chance to look at the menu! Other than that, she was very attentive and courteous so I'll give them points for service. \nWe ordered the steamed pork pot stickers, which were pretty decent. For entrees, I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and my boyfriend had the Mongolian Crispy Fried Noodles. The Kung Pao chicken was disgusting. Firstly, it was not spicy at all, even though it's marked as spicy on their menu. The chicken wasn't marinated and tasted like boiled chicken covered with sauce. The Mongolian Crispy Fried Noodles were much better, although nothing really worth writing home about.\nI'm never going back. I'd much rather eat at places that focus one thing and master it rather than being a Jack of all trades and trying their hand at everything from Chinese and Thai to Spanish and Tapas."
1,"It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner."
0,"I'm not one to slam a service, especially if I haven't used it, unfortunately here's my experience. I called Insectek becuase of everyones' 5 star comments on Yelp. I was calling for a quote. I told the owner that I had brown dog ticks in the backyard and some in the house on the dog beds. He asked for my address (Arcadia) and the size of my home and lot. I told him 2400 sq. feet, and the lot I wasnt sure of but that it was around 3,500 sq. feet. He quoted me $700 for the size of my property for outside and inside treatment (visiting a total of 3 times in a 30 day period so every 7-10 days or so), then the bi-monthly service would be $68 every 2 months. It sounded expensive. He told me that it might even be more than that depending on how hard it would be to get to the ticks and the size of the property and conditions... I thought to myself hummm... that ounds odd. He said that they charge a normal price for how long they stay to do the work and treat tthat they would do my carpets as well. Not the entire carpets but the very edge up to the baseboards on all areas of each room as well as the corners and any crevices that may be on top of the baseboards they would spray in. It sounded very thourough. He offered to have Lucio come out to give me a firm quote 2 days before my appointment bc i ne. If you click on their website from the yelp add on the right hand side you will see that you get 50% off your initial treament... I asked the owner about that while I was on the phone and he said that has nothing to do with treating ticks and that its entirely different and a different process... so there went that discount. However, it doesn't say that on the website. Oh well, I set the actual extermination appointment for this Friday at 10:30 am, I arranged my father in law to watch the house while I take the kids out to the park and lunch waiting for the chemicals to dry. I told him that It was still good for me to know the firm quote though so we arranged for Lucio to be at my house at 12:30pm today (Wednesday). Mind you, I have called 3 other companies since my convo. with the owner of Insetek. They have all quoted anywhere from $200 to $300 for the extermination and $45 to $50/month after for upkeep. I was starting to get the vibe maybe I was over quoted but I didn't call to cancel my \""firm quote\"" appointment with Lucio just yet. I wanted to see what Lucio had to say about why it was so much money upfront for coming 3 times the first month and higher on the monthly side, with no guaruntee if it didn't work... also maybe there was some magic potion they used on brown dog ticks that I had never heard of, so I wanted to give them a chance based on the reviews. He arrived, yes he's very nice, and friendly and calls you mam and shakes your hand is well dressed and wears booties... but the second I asked him about what chemicals he was going to be using it threw him for a loop. He was off his game. I told him that I just wanted to know the names of them and the gallons he was going to use on the size of my property and about how long it would take. He stumbled on his words, told me that the office could email me that kind of thing and that he would just walk the property and see. I also told him before he walked the property that I had gotten 3 quotes since my phone call with him and that they were sooo much less and I was just curious why. He asked me how much and I told him.. He hopped on the phone and called the owner while he was outside. He came back inside and said that he would charge $500 if I did the bi-monthly service for $68 a month and wanted to set an appointment. I told him that I already had an appointment for 10:30 am on Friday and that I would see him then after he could somehow get a list of chemicals that were to be used on my exact property and size.... He said, well I filled that spot since you needed a firm quote first so we need to reschedule and we need to do it tomorrow. He said he would provide a list of chemicals. I was not feeling too great about things becuase they just lowered the price randomly... at that point I had a feeling this wasnt the right place to do business. My gut was telling me that I should cancel by the end of business today and go with another company. What made things so obvious that this is a shady company is that Lucio stayed in his car in my front driveway for 10 min. talking on the phone, I was on my phone as well calling the other companies to see if they could give me an idea of what the exact names of the chemicals they use are called to see what they are called. Just then Lucio walked up to my door and rang the doorbell. I opened it up and he said, \""The names of the chemicals are Temprid, Suspend, Bifred granuals.... but we don't usually do this. Will you be keeping the appointment or no?\"" Cancelled. Nice guy, bad business play. Expect the unexpected. Never expect a sale."
0,"aaaaaaaaaaack! \n\nI just stopped by here for a slice and salad combo. I hadnt been in for a couple years, and man things have changed.\n\nfirst up was the salad. I was so psyched on life when I saw how huge it was! One bite and I quickly knew I wouldnt be eating much more. I got the ceasar salad and the dressing tasted \""off\"", the salad itself was pretty warm. Not a welcoming salad at all. \n\nThen came the pizza. The pizza here used to be really good. Not so much anymore. It was all dried out and crusty. \n\nI tossed my lunch and am thankful I had an apple squirrled away in the fridge. $8 down the drain."
3,"This is not your neighborhood Mexican taqueria or Chevy's. The food here is pretty darn good. They have tableside Guacamole-which we didn't get since they had this fancy display of salsas (mild, med, hot) and fresh chips. Then our server brought out a tray of seasoned salt for more flavoring if you like, totally unnecessary but nice to have I guess. We ordered the Diego Seafood Cocktail ceviche, Pork Carnitas taco, and Crispy Shrimp with Chipotle Aioli tacos. I, the alcoholic in the relationship, ordered a margarita with my lunch--which I can't remember the name but it was so good, one of the best I've ever had. Ask your server when you go there; I think it was the signature (pink) fruity something. The seafood ceviche was typical - you get Shrimp, scallops, avocado, salsa. It was good. Our server was happy to cancel our pork carnitas taco bc we were getting full from the salsa and ceviche and had dinner reservations at 7pm. We kept the crispy shrimp tacos -so glad we did bc it was delicious. The Aioli sauce was bomb. I've never been to Cancun or Mexico but I imagine the seafood tacos at the resorts to taste just like it. Although they were short staff on a Memorial Day weekend, our server had the most upbeat,  perkiest, will do whatever you want attitude. I watched as she ran from table to table talking orders, delivering drinks, making small talk with her CAN DO attitude the entire time. Much props for that! I enjoy my meal very much although service was a little slow."
3,"$18 bucks w/ tax for all you can eat sushi/bbq/whatever.\n\nMy favorites - sake sushi, orange chicken, lo mein, and the fried sesame rice balls.\n\nFor all-you-can eat, it has a good price and food that actually tastes decent.  That's tough to beat."
0,"I've been taking my dog to Banfield since she was a puppy and usually have sub-par service. This time, however, I was even more disturbed by my visit. \n\nI had to wait almost 20 minutes until someone came into the room to see my dog and I. The vet tech was friendly, but the veterinarian was a different story. She kept badgering me about getting a wellness plan and hinted that the plan included dental care. When she looked at my dog, she then proceeded to make comments about my dog's teeth and plaque build-up. Clearly a scheme. \n\nThe most disturbing part about the visit was when my dog wouldn't eat the dog biscuit the vet tried to give her. When she wouldn't eat it, the vet proceeded to grab a can of Cheese Whiz (CHEESE WHIZ) off the counter and give my dog a big glob of it. \n\na) The vet did not even ask me if this was okay. Would you go up to someone's infant child and give it candy without asking the mother first? Probably not.\n\nb) I find it incredibly ironic that we're in a pet store surrounded by thousands of different kinds of dog treats, but the vet gives my dog processed human \""food.\"" I don't even eat cheese whiz, let alone feed it to my dog!\n\nc) The vet attempted justifying her case when she could tell I was disturbed by this. She said \""Well, dogs eat anything, they even eat out of the trash.\""  and \""It's real cheese.\"" wow. Her only valid justification was \""dogs need positive reinforcement after a visit\"" which I completely agree with. BUT, you couldn't find a more suitable option for a treat? \n\nAfter speaking with the manager of the store, Brenda, I was told that they use Cheese Whiz as a distraction and treat for dogs because they like it so much. Well, yeah, I'm sure they would like a Whopper and fries too, but clearly that wouldn't be the best option for them. When I asked her if she would recommend Cheese Whiz as a healthy treat for dogs, she said, \""Well, no, but a little bit doesn't hurt.\"" \n\nI highly doubt any veterinarian elsewhere would recommend Cheese Whiz as a suitable treat for dogs. \n\nNeedless to say, I am not giving Banfield any more of my service."
2,Yum. Very healthy and fresh. The potstickers were delicious. My only complaint is that they are always out of white meat (chicken). Not sure what that is about. LOL\n\nWanted to update the review...I tried the boba here and it was terrible. Way undercooked. The service isn't too great either.
0,"Both sandwiches blew. Honestly. I want my $19 back. \nThe honey bacon turkey, or whatever the hell I ordered, had \""fake turkey\""... really? It's not like I went to a place known for pasta and ordered a sandwich. It's a SANDWICH SHOP, and they skimp on the quality of their deli meats. *smdh*\nThe sandwich itself was way too greasy and the honey mustard was neon yellow in color. Terrifying. \nHubs ordered the pork sandwich and it was dry (no bbq sauce?), there wasn't any sort of seasoning on the cabbage, the whole thing was just overwhelmed by the choice of thick ciabatta bread. \nSoup was okay, but not very hot. \nI did think the stale piece of bread and 2 rotted \""chocolate covered\"" strawberries were an excellent touch. *side eye*"

They didn't even offer to fix another day or anything just that it was my problem now."
2,"My wife and i stayed there for our anniversary and had a great time.  little dissappointed in the cottage we stayed in.  i know the place is old but you have to update and remodel every once in awhile (century).  I want to give 4 stars but i also think that the price was a little steep for a summer rate.  Now, i know that i should expect to pay alot for the biltmore but i am not the ritzy type of person.  I am sure my wife would give it 5 stars."
2,"This place is ok, as my rating says. I come here for the lemon horns. They run out relatively quickly so get here early. The pastry is flaky and the filling is just as a lemon filling should taste - sweet yet acidic. The cakes are ok but not too impressive. They had a recent renovation which seemed useless. I'm sure there are better in Chinatown. The only reason this one is frequented so often is because of its location next to the 99 Ranch Market."
2,Wish I could do 2 and a half stars.....Went here for Thursday bogo night (yes it is only specific rolls and of those there are no vegetarian options????  WTF???).  But what I had was on the low-end of 'fine'.  The salmon when it came out in one of the rolls was room-temperature.  Hmmm....I had never experienced that before.  Not super appealing.  The rest was 'just fine' especially for those prices.  \n\nI liked the 'green' chopsticks - instead of the throw-aways they had plastic ones that were heftier.  Great job on that guys!  \n\nThe bar service was better than the table service.  Try not to come at peak hours on bogo night and I am sure the service would be better.  \n\nThere have been many establishments in this location and this is by far the best one.  I hope you stick around Akahana!!!  :-D
4,THey have the best chicken fried steak that I have ever had!!! There daily specials are amazing as well!!
4,"Compared to Sora Ramen, I like this much better.  We had the thin noodles and they were al dente. The broth was also thicker and tastier. Try the takana fried rice (with mustard greens). It was also very tasty!"
3,"I really like Paradise Bakery, I was at this location every morning for about 2 years. The staff was always friendly but sometimes the line can get long if a lot of people come in at once. It can be a long wait to get served. Being a big muffin fan I always loved the apple cinnamon and blueberry muffins and they are consistently good.\n\nThe Paradise rewards are a nice perk, compared to other coffee shops it is easy to earn free drinks and food if you are a regular and would spend the money anyway.\n\nThe only reason this location looses one star is the sometimes pushy home business folk that take over every available booth and camp with their laptops. This is during the week. On weekends you get whole families with screaming kids. This does not seem to happen at the other locations in the area, could be the proximity to the hotel next door."
1,"I have had mediocre service at the other Best Buy locations in town. This one, however, took the cake. I called before arriving, to pick up a popular TV-on-DVD series, and was told they had several in stock of both regular DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nWhen I arrive, there is limited signage and organization to this location. I finally locate the right department, and there are only Blu-ray copies of this DVD available. It takes several minutes to locate an employee.\n\nEmployee A comes over, hears my dilemma, and stares at the shelf. I have to prompt him to look up whether other copies are available and if perhaps there is another display featuring this series. He seems high as a kite and does not seem to understand the problem. After waiting several minutes, Employee B finishes nearby with another customer, hears the synopsis of my situation, and locates the DVD in question in under two minutes with a smile on his face.\n\nI'm generally not one to review chain stores very often, or to judge employees based on their handling of one customer, but you either need to be more discerning with your hiring practices or amp up your training procedures if someone can be this thoroughly inept while on the clock at your business."
1,"It was a late night and almost everything else was closed. I was VERY happy that I had an option for dinner. There were three or four other tables filled at the time so we figured that it couldn't be that bad. I was hungry and quick to order:\n\nBread and Butter\nFrench Onion Soup\nBoneless Buffalo Wings\n16oz Prime Rib (medium) with baked sweet potato and Mac'n cheese\n\nI was happy to have the bread arrive so soon after our order due to how hungry I was; it helped that it was actually rather tasty. I was hoping that the bread would be a foreshadowing of the rest of the meal when the french onion soup arrived. I was a tad let down by the size of the soup. I was really let down when I tried to the soup; it was just not something I wanted to order again. \n\nAs I was picking through the soup, my boneless buffalo wings arrived. I immediately switched gears and dug into the wings. I don't understand what they did in the kitchen, but the wings tasted more like liquid smoke than buffalo. My thoughts of a great late-night dinner were quickly dissipating. At this point, I was hoping that the entree would should show me something that was better than what I had tried.\n\nWhen the entree arrived I was surprised yet again by the fact that my mac'n cheese was missing. My server assured me that it would be coming so dug into the meat and sweet potato. I was still rather hungry since I hadn't eaten much of the soup or the wings. The meat was a tad overcooked while the sweet potato was undercooked. I moved the potato to the side and focused on the meat. While I never did receive the mac'n cheese, I don't know that I would have eaten considering the quality of the rest of the food.\n\nAfter seeing the bill, I can guarantee that I won't return to this particular steakhouse."
2,"It was a fun experience, however make sure you book a reservation 24 hours in advance if you are using a Groupon or coupon, because the female staff get very snappy and condescending if you do not. We called ahead and asked if it was fine to use our Groupon even though we had not made reservations, and the girl who answered the phone said it was fine. Apparently, she did not run that by the rest of the staff because they pretty much made us feel like we had broken a cardinal rule when we arrived. \n\nBesides the inhospitable front desk staff, the bartender was awesomely entertaining and the rest of the experience was positive. Probably will not go back again, unless I have visitors from out of town, but it's worth at least one visit if you have not already been."
4,"This is a great park. It's close to my house. You can go run, walk, or ride a bike on the path around the park. I do yoga there sometimes too. It's perfect."
4,"Today I went to Super Cuts and had my hair cut by Sandy, I usually don't write reviews, but after spending time in her chair today and leaving with my hair looking great, I want others to know about her, she is good at her job and is a kind easy going person. I will be returning for my next hair cut, of course with Sandy."
2,"Presentation gets 5 stars, taste more of a 3-3.5 stars. Was hoping the flavors would blow me away more, but the experience was still great. \n\nThis is in the same shopping center as Raku the regular restaurant, but Sweets Raku is towards the front of the parking lot! We were confused at first and didn't know they were difference restaurants. \n\nFOOD:\nRed rock (4 stars): Raspberry and white chocolate go so well together. The raspberry sauce is really good. My favorite dish out of the ones I tried. The sauce in the cake part is nice and warm too. All the textures work really well together. \n\nBaton (3.75 stars) Couldn't taste any pistachio in the dish. The chocolate cake with what tasted like a raspberry or wine like sauce at the bottom was really rich and good! The passion fruit gelee bits were also good. You can't taste all the individual flavors together though, I had to specifically look for each component to get that flavor. But I did like the chocolate wafer it was covered in. \n\nStella (3 stars): My least favorite. Definitely not a tiramisu. More of a strawberry tart. \n\nCalbri (3.5): If you love fruits and mango you should get this one. Very pretty dish and great presentation. The most fun to get because they poor a sauce over the chocolate covering the glass. But the dish is not so pretty once you start eating it because the glass starts getting smeary and you can't see what you're eating from the sides of the glass anymore. It had a lot of components but you mostly taste mango. \n\nSuch beautiful presentation. It's a great experience, makes you feel fancy in Chinatown. I love food art so I had a great time seeing the beautiful dishes come out. The flavors just didn't live up to the presentation. Each dessert was $12 and each person needs to order one. I just didn't feel like all the flavors in the description came out in each dish. I have the biggest sweet tooth and I love desserts, so I am a little more picky about them being perfect. \n\nATMOSPHERE:\nVery pretty restaurant. You can sit at the bar and watch them make the desserts. They first come out with edible menus which was really cool. They give you a yummy raspberry sauce to dip it in. And I had to check out the bathroom after reading reviews on here. It is a really nice bathroom, haha, so check it out as you wait. \n\nSERVICE:\nOur waitress was really nice. I noticed when someone was about to walk in the door they say something out loud to let the waitress know to come out and greet them. So service is important to them. They also put a cute chocolate sign that said happy father's day on one of the desserts for a father when we came in on father's day, so nice."
0,"Hillstone: you are overrated. You think you are better than you are. Every time I go, I am disappointed and my friends say we are never coming back. \nWe sure miss Houston's in the Biltmore. You tried, but it's not the same. \nThere are so many great places in Phoenix. Hillstone is good. Not great."
3,After spending a few summers in Phoenix you learn to locate and love certain watering holes.  One of the best treats to cool off the perspiration of a long Phoenix afternoon is the date shake at Sphinx.  This place has a long history with Scottsdale and its shakes have been hydrating sweaty residents for several decades now.
3,"My husband and I visited the Blue Martini for Salsa Night (Thursday).  The atmosphere was nice, wonderful staff.  It was our 10th Anniversary and Brian, who dropped off our platter told the DJ who posted a message on the screen wishing us a Happy 10th Anniversary.  Our waitress, Amanda was really sweet.  She brought out a nice chocolate cake for us to enjoy on our anniversary. The only negative I could really say is that it was Salsa Night so we expected the Band to play Salsa music but they played more modern Latin music (stuff you could hear on the radio). We actually enjoyed it more every time the DJ played music, everyone got up and danced. We would definitely come back in the future."
1,"Risotto = basically rice in Cheese Whiz. \nGnocchi = supermarket-shelf pasta, drenched in cream.\nWine selection abhorrent.\nWay overpriced. \nOne of the most depressing Italian meals of my life.\nAmbiance? Huge, glaring TV screens, inexperienced wait staff, dark lighting (could barely see my plate!)"
0,I'm so sad to say they are no longer here.   Not sure if they moved or went out of business but their equipment is torn out.  :(
4,"Must always make a detour here every time!!\n\nThis location is open 24 hours so got two 20\"" Capastrami cut in half to take home as souvenirs for friends waiting at home. That's how we roll.\n\nA day later, heated up, still great!"
4,"Best place! Great service and selection. Also, very competitive and after much of comparison shopping I was back! \nLinas was very friendly and knowledgeable. He is very passionate for what he does and I saw him taking care of customers. \nDefinitely coming back!"
4,"We LOVE this place and couldn't be happier to have them on the west side!  Fresh, unique, incredibly delicious food in a comfortable atmosphere and contrary to other reviews, our service has always been exemplary!  Not at all the typical swimming-in-grease-and-cheese Mexican food but fresh and interesting and an extensive menu!  We are regulars and have hardly made a dent at trying everything they offer!  The salsa bar is like no other and stands on its own in making this a must-go destination!  Give this great restaurant a try....you won't be disappointed.  Then, tell all your friends and family so one of Glendale's best restaurants stays here!"
3,"I've been here a couple times and from reading other reviews, I must have come on a good night!  Both times I was here we sat on the patio and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  They have a large rock pit? in the middle that they light when it's cold for heat.  \n\nI really love the mussels in the white sauce here and last time I also had the spinach salad.  It was delicious!  Fresh and served with the perfect amount of bacon vinaigrette.\n\nThe service is good, nothing special - but what is with the waitresses wearing flip flops?  I just don't see how that is sanitary especially if they're walking in the kitchen.  \n\nOverall it was good and I'm sure I'll be back.  I keep meaning to come for happy hour when they have 1/2 price appetizers!  A bowl of mussels and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc is all I need for an inexpensive and tasty dinner."
3,"Stayed here when I traveled for work about a month ago. \n\nWhat I liked:\n-Really liked the room; bed, separate room for sofa, tv, and mini fridge\n-free Internet in my room\n-great rate for a weeknight, just around $100\n-hotel had a cool interior, open floors, but not loud where you could hear chatter.\n\nWhy no fifth star:\n-parking garage is really confusing to navigate\n-breakfast was a bit expensive, get the buffet, not the menu items.\n\nWould come back here since it's close to work and good value for a Hilton."
3,"Probably my favorite brunch spot in Madison. You can always expect to wait at least 15 minutes at Marigold, because they serve food in style similar to Panera (wait in line to order & pay, wait at table for food), and the line always reaches to the door. It's worth the wait.\n\nI usually opt for the breakfast sandwich option, which is different depending on when you go, since Marigold has a rotating menu. The sandwiches are always amazing, though the accompanying potatoes are just okay. It's usually enough food for me to take something home. I've also tried the scramblers a few times and have never been disappointed.\n\nThey have delicious iced teas and other gourmet drinks to sip on while you wait for a table. Tables are available on a first come, first serve basis, so it's probably not a great spot if you're with a large group, since you could end up waiting quite a while."
3,"We have eaten at Montesano's a few times, but always from their pasta menu and never the pizza. So with that in mind...the review. There is no shortage of Italian restaurants anywhere in LV/Henderson and the styles and flavors are endless. And like most food, everyone has their favorite, and their 5-star pick may be someone elses 2 star. Such is food, particularly ethnic food. Heck, we have even been to Italy for a few weeks and considered that to be some of the worst Italian food we had ever had...so go figure. Anyway, the food that we have had here is pretty damn good. Maybe not the 'best I have had anywhere', but very good nonetheless. The last time there, had the Spag and meatballs. The balls were huge and plenty of pasta, although the sauce was a little light, but they happily brought more. My wife went for the raviolis with a different sauce than mine, and it was great too. The restaurant was very casual, which is exactly how I like it. Don't shove tablecloths-candles-etc in front of me---I am there to eat. And that is what I did, and we willl be back."
4,"My spazzamatic mutt has been a handful since she became my dog several years ago. I've met with various trainers over the years and read as much as possible about dog training but have never really been able to teach her how she needs to behave in certain situations. It's been frustrating for both of us and even the other dog in the house, Angel Dog, would roll her eyes at Spazz's antics. \n\nI don't recall how I found Zoom Room but when checking them out on Yelp I saw they had a Yelp deal and decided to give them a shot.  I enrolled in the leash walking class. Honestly, for a 3 session class my hopes weren't that high.  I was wrong. \n\nJulene has been our teacher for the leash walking class. She is patient and has a knack for explaining what to do so I understand. They use only positive reinforcement methods and make it fun for both the dogs and owners.  You of course need to practice at home but I'm amazed at how quickly I have seen improvement.  I really feel much more in control and Ms. Spazz seems more relaxed and happy.  I've even tried a few of the methods with Angel Dog and it's improving her behavior also. I couldn't be happier I decided to check Zoom Room out. We'll definitely be signing up for another class. \n\nThe only negative is their location. Coming from the uptown area it's horrible to try to make at 6:30 on a workday. However, it's clearly a plus for many people if you live in that area.  And, if I'm willing to drive from Plaza-Midwood out to this area, it's only for something really good!"
2,"This is a nice limited service hotel in Middleton, next to a gigantic health club.  It is easy to get to when you get off the highway.  There isn't much you can walk to from here, but i would assume most people have a car that are staying at the Hampton Inn.\n\nThe rooms are comfortably large.  \n\nThe bed i slept in, a true King, was just so-so.  The mattress was a bit too firm and the blanket was pretty cheap.  They need an upgrade there.  The tv was a flat screen, but it was on the smaller side for the size of the room.  I did like that the bathroom i had didn't have a useless bathtub and instead had a walk in shower.  There was also complimentary Wi-Fi that worked well.\n\nThey also have breakfast in the morning.  Standard fare for these hotels.  They had nasty bacon however.  I love bacon and the bacon they had wasn't worth touching.  But the coffee, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs and fruit was fine.\n\nI would stay there again if i had to, but not my first choice in Madison."
4,Amazing food! Went there for my first time and food was fresh. \n\nI'm a huge fan of Mexican food & have had a lot but this place is awesome! The service is great & fast but the seating is not quite roomy. Although it didn't stop me from enjoying my food!
4,One of my favorite bar/restaurants in Pittsburgh.  I always find a seat at the bar and the service is always great.   The scotch eggs are out of this world!! \nThe beer selection is outstanding and although I love the scotch eggs .. there are many other menu items that are just mouth watering such as the turkey sandwich with dill mayo.. oh my..   lets go now!\n\nLove Pipers Pub!
4,"Auld Dubliner Irish Pub\n\nPicture this a Italian  village complete lakes, and waterfalls. This oasis in the middle of Nevada desert is a nice respit from the Chaotic Vegas strip. \n\nFirst this you will notice is the open air styling from the bar to outside patio\n\nSecond thing you will notice is the amount of wood in this place!  Hee hee \""amount of wood\"" :O)\n\nThird thing is selection of Single Malt Irish Whiskey, and bar taps..... hmmm whisky! \n\nFare: The food is okay.  I had the \""Boxty\"" if you have not had a \""Boxty\"" it is great! This potato is flat and usually has a bunch of veggies, and some meats stuffed in this great fluffy, tasty cake... \n\nPrice: Reasonable"
4,"Wow, yet another amazing restaurant, how come that does not \""Surprise\"" me, coming from the \""Sister\"" restaurant \""Rice Paper\"". Dropped in last night to see what the buzz was about and ordered the Fillet & Jumbo Shrimp with fresh lemon grass which was made with perfection with a perfectly balanced dipping sauce served with a side of rice, a small bowl of the pho soup stock and a tasty side salad. Dennis and Hue brought out  a  Cornish Game hen that was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, these culinary marvels don't mess around!!! and of course it also came with a wonderful dipping sauce. Both dishes were superb not to mention the hospitality from Dennis the proprietor who tells me he only  uses the freshest ingredients and boy your palate sure notices the difference. The food quality exceeds the price of the menu, I would pay double for the quality given here. Saigon Kitchen you have a customer for life here, can't wait to bring my family in here.\nLooks like Saigon Kitchen and Rice Paper are my home away from home now!!!!"
3,"Still good food.  BYOB, so take a nice bottle.  \n\nStarted with the brad and been and green dip.  Nice start!  Shared a beet salad with goat cheese that was very good. Had the Pappardelle w/sausage, onion, goat cheese in a light read sauce.  Delicious meal.  Great pasta and some of the better sausage around.   Only able to eat half so had nice meal the next day.\n\nService was good.  Did not have the waitress we are use to, she was not working.  Don't expect your meal to come flying out of the kitchen.  It was crowded late on a Sunday night and the chef was busy."
2,"The food is Good But way too expensive for what you get.  \n\nEssentially, this place serves elevated Chinese food.  They make what seem to be traditional Chinese dishes with elevated ingredients.   It sounds great, but I am not sure it was that much more amazing than what we would have gotten at our favorite Chinese restaurant back home.   Our final bill for two came out to $170 with tip, and back home a similar meal would have been $45 at most.   And to put it into perspective, we didn't order any of the more expensive items.   We got a  Beef Dish, A chicken dish, and an appetizer and a desert.  All the dishes were good.    I can understand that better ingredients warrant a higher price but this was a bit much.  If the prices were more reasonable, I would have given it a higher rating..     \n\nI will admit that the service was amazing.  There were multiple servers all concerned with every aspect of the meal.  The decor was amazing, it almost seemed like a cirque du soleil Set."
4,"We bought two cameras from Lauren. She knew we didn't live there, we were on vacation. She was patient and really went long on the set up and tips. Very engaging, this is our camera place when we are in Arizona!"
1,Ordered from them and was told an hour and ten min wait. It took well over an hour and a half and the people on the phone were short and didnt take any information from me when I called to tell them about the gate code. I had to remind them to contact the driver but it made no difference. They had one elderly driver due to what was told to me was because the younger people didnt want to work late. My pizza was hardly warm and I feel bad for the elderly delivery guy running pizzas.
4,"Loved it! Went here on a Sunday a.m. And took full advantage of the heated chairs, whirlpool, sauna, rainshower and steam room before my treatment. Had the Bacial and it was very nice. Smelled wonderful everywhere. I would do this every year on race day :)"
2,"I have to say, I was quite disappointed with the crepes.  We got the Queen City and Mascarpone and Berries. They were thick and more like burrito texture than actually crepes.  Don't think i will  be coming here again for crepes."
4,"You can't go wrong with this place. Anything you order will melt your heart and have you wishing you lived near this bakery. Sometimes there is a line and nowhere to sit but who cares. Learn to be patient , walk to the nearest park and enjoy bliss."
0,"I love Dominoes, and I USUALLY like this location, but I will not be ordering from this store again after tonight. We spent $30 on two pizzas and stuffed cheesy bread, and both pizzas were prepared wrong. The pizza we ordered for our children was supposed to be half pepperoni and half bacon... and they skipped the bacon entirely. Our pizza should have been Italian sausage and black olives... And they didn't put on any sausage. I also paid the stupid extra fee for a cup of marinara sauce for the cheesy bread... No marinara. All of this could have been solved nicely if the manager had simply gotten on the phone when we called and helped right the wrongs... But he didn't. He yelled at his employee from across the room what to say to us and made the poor kid be the middle man for the whole conversation. Refused to refund us or do anything to remedy the situation. Sorry Dominoes. You lost four customers today."
2,"So happy to have a Thai restaurant in the South Hills!  Since it's new, I'm hoping that things will smooth out and it will be my go-to for Thai food.  We ordered Pad Thai and Panang Curry, both with chicken and both at an 8 on the spice level.  The Pad Thai was not bad, with thin rice noodles perfectly prepared.  There could have been more chicken, but otherwise not bad.  The Panang Curry had the right coconut flavor, but it had pineapple in it, which was an unwelcome addition.  Neither dish came anywhere close to being spicy.  One was about a 2-3 and the other maybe a 5.  They were very busy on a Friday night but the guy at the register was very pleasant and seemed to be doing everything in the front of the restaurant while the other two staff just watched.  I will definitely go back and hope that they just keep improving."
0,"Worse store in history!!! They make you make mutilple purchases throughout the store,like your a criminal.i went into the cosmetic department for a female product,made me take it out and pay by itself( very embarrassed ). That was one.then I wanted a simple pair of headphone, had to make another purchase ,another time I wanted to make a game purchase ,the guy wouldn't even hand it to me,like I was a child and he held it above his head making everybody see.i really felt very uncomfortable ,like i was really going to steal it.not to mention I had to wait 20 min for someone to get keys. then i had to get other items then had to go to the front of store and pay for a third time.by the time i finished,it took 2 hrs to get out,then i had to show riecipts to get out of store,no surprise,i lost one.it was a huge ordeal.really don't need the frustration ,I have enough going on,targets right across the street,so that's where I go now.a little more expensive but well worth the piece of mind,not being looked and and make you feel like a criminal!the vision center,ohhh don't get me started there cheap frames,the say that the will replace them for a year,and nope,not to mention the hate people"
2,"My girl friends and I kicked off our Vegas weekend with a late and light lunch at Holsteins.  I was salivating when I saw Billionaire burger ($28) on the menu with kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo, but I decided that the Hen House burger ($14) was good enough for half the price with its fried egg and bacon.  That is, until our server highly recommended the award winning Gold Standard burger ($17.50) with dry aged beef, bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic chive aioli.  It was done--I would eat the winner.\n\nAlthough complex and tasty, the Gold Standard didn't make me shake my buns or roll my eyes backwards.  I didn't care for the fancy stuff like goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, or baby arugula.  For a gourmet burger, Umami Burger (multiple locations in LA and one in SF) is my gold standard and it's about 2/3 of the prices here.  I did, however, enjoy the shoestring fries at Holsteins.  They're skinny, crisp, wonderful, and plentiful.  \n\nIf you have a car in Vegas, you should make the trek to Bachi Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bachi-burger-las-vegas).  Now there's a burger joint worthy of being called the best burger in Sin City."
0,"We went to English today for tea.  There was a small group of people standing at the entrance, and they informed us that although they had called twice to check on hours, they were not being seated because a private party was there, and the waiter told them they could not let them in until that party had been served.  I peaked in and saw there was a group that took up about 1/4 of the restaurant, and also noted that there were 3 waiters and a bartender just standing there. So I said that it looked like they had plenty of help, so why can't we be seated?  The answer we were given was that there was not enough kitchen help.  The one lady asked for the manager and we were told the manager was not there, so she asked for his/her card, which took several minutes to produce. They left, we left, and the two parties behind us left.  We come in from Boulder City just to have tea now and then, but we never were treated like this before.  It appeared they had plenty of wait staff, why didn't they add kitchen staff as well?  The manager should have been there helping!\nBig disappointment, WONT BE BACK!!!"
4,Great service and Beer could have done without the girl pushing a survey. will return when in town
3,"Much better experience this time now that I know which foods I should stay clear of.  They had a lot of fresh fish out in the hot buffet lines such as sole and flounder, and our server was very attentive and friendly.  Good selection of seafood in general, and while some of the sashimi still isn't totally thawed out, I suppose if you wait long enough for it to thaw on your plate it will taste OK."
3,"Super cool bar, friendly staff and very comfortable environment. Drinks and food are both very affordable and delish. Great happy hour specials too. It's s small establishment so it can get busy. But it's always fun no matter what."
3,Service was incredible.  We were a group of seven and all were pleased with the food and service provided.  We would all definitely recommend and return.
0,"We should have checked the Yelp reviews before we went to The Noodle Shop at Mandalay Bay.   It is absolutely terrible.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  \n\nWe ordered the \""Roasted Crispy Duck\"" appetizer and was told that it actually wasn't crispy, but just roasted.  We got it anyway and it was disgusting.  The taste was lousy and it was some of the worst duck I've ever had.  \n\nWe also ordered the Cashew Chicken.  Our waitress came out about 5 minutes after we ordered and told us they were out of cashews, but they would make it without cashews.  Are you kidding me?  They ran out of cashews?\n\nOur waitress was awful.  She was extremely annoying and her manager wasn't any better, as she seemed about as clueless as the waitress.  \n\nI give you all the same advise I told people looking at the menu when we were leaving: this place is terrible.  Don't eat here."
0,"Where do I start, well, let me just make this short and simple....  We had ordered from them the delivery/ catering option to be delivered on the 24th for a Christmas eve party.    40 guests were invited, that's right 40, and would you believe it, they never show up!!!! I mean, no phone call, nothing, the plans  and evenings of 40 HUMAN BEINGS, customers, potential customers, WERE NOT FED and this is on CHRISTMAS EVE for a party, not that easy to just change plans.  And can you believe as the hosts how we felt, this was beyond something terrible, this was a Christmas Nightmare!!! This place was even called the day before at 2:00 to verify the order.  No excuses on this one.\n\n\n Places like this, who could even possibly do this to their customers, or fail to deliver in this fashion, there should be a law against this, this was just wrong, beware people, on just principle I would say this place in not worthy of ones business, after this incident, I am left speechless, it caused soo much stress and heartache, unbelievable..."
1,Not pleased with this branch at all. :/ I see no logic in telling me I can't use checks I am cashing to get a cashiers check when I am an account holder.  BUT..... I can cash those checks come back and they would issue me one? Fucking stupid! !!!! How is that logical? All they did is piss me off to the point I won't come to this branch.  I seriously want to walk back in and get a money order with the teller right next to the other guy.  Grrrrrrrrrr.
4,"After 4 years on the University of Illinois campus, I have never found a place that does an exceptional job of eyebrow waxing- until today. \nMary Kay listened to my requests and concerns about my eyebrows, and proceeded to give me an eyebrow wax based off of the structure of my face. I am more than happy with the results and I will continue to come back to Mary Kay's for further treatments. \nHer prices are very reasonable for the services she offers. Seriously, check this place out!"
1,"Kind of like a one night stand, quick, dirty, cheap and you feel like crap in the morning."
0,"For the sake of the Mountain Island area, I hope this highly visible establishment improves and makes it. The food and service is simply awful. A menu that has 50+ items is bound to be bad. Focus on something or a category and make it good.  Server rushed us and we were one of 10 tables, in the entire place. She dropped off a pile of napkins with a mystery goo / ranch-like thumbprint on them. We put them on the floor. \n\nWe usually cave in and go here every 6 months because we're tired and hungry. Staying home and eating crackers would be more satisfying.\n\nAnd, they brought me a Sam Adams...in a Bud Light pint glass. No no."
2,"I headed over to here after roller derby shenanigans one Thursday night. Thursdays at Hartigans are karaoke night so I was kept pretty entertained.\n\nThe interior is nice-- almost sport-bar-y by feel rather than a pub. Brightly lit, and more tables and bar seats than booths. \n\nThe bartender wasn't exactly rude to me, but not particularly nice either.\n\nI snacked on some fries while I was there- pretty subpar. The beer selection was mediocre and definitely a pinch more pricey than the quality I got.\n\nOne great thing though, I have to mention, about this place is it is GLBT friendly and not flamboyant about it. In the south, that isn't as common so yeah. Props for that."
0,"I love getting a shave. Its a personal treat for myself that I try to get once every other month.  I've gone to this V's down the street from me about 4 times for a cut and shave and only twice have walked away happy and those were my first two visits and it just kept getting worse. \n\nTrying to get an appointment on Friday or the weekend is a wasted effort but then again so is trying to make one for any other time. I thought I knew the the drill with this place by now. Close at 6pm no shave appointments past 5pm all of which I can understand for a good cut and shave. \n\nSo today with my girlfriends birthday weekend around the corner I call in and make my appointment at 5pm for a cut and shave knowing full well I had a less than great experience on my last visit. But a boy has a right to dream I guess. I leave work early to be there at 5 mins early only to be told to sit and wait a half hour which sucks but its not the first time they have failed the appointment game for me thus the 5 mins early. But I think I'm getting my shave so I sit and wait my turn.\n\nAfter my wait they get me in the chair and give me the worst speed cut I've ever had. My scalp still stings 2 hours later from the buzzer being dragged through it. After the \""cut\"" the barber (if you want to call him that) asks \""Did you want a shave too?\"". Is it really that hard for someone to tell you up front they don't have time to give you a shave?\n\nI was kind of at a lost for words which wasn't a problem for him because he filled the silence with \""Cause I can buzz it off and save you a few bucks but we need to close our doors\"". Knowing that I have a full schedule till the weekend and thinking it couldn't be worse than me doing it myself I made the terrible mistake of letting him \""buzz it off\"" which is the equivalent of letting someone take an electric sander to your face. No oils, no soothing balm, no warm towel just some deep red scratches and a feeling of dejection. \n\nAll of this, my leaving work early 30 mins early, my wasted 30 mins waiting , my blitz of a hair cut and my 'not shave' with scars included cost me $31. Which is a $13 savings compared with my last visit. \n\nAnd that was and will be my last visit to V's Barbershop."
0,"Okay so it's been almost a year since I discovered their breakfast burrito. The first time it was incredible, but I've noticed that each time I go back, it gets a little bit worse.\n\nSeveral times, they've forgotten potatoes or salsa or even cheese in my burrito. It's been poorly or hastily wrapped in such a way that it doesn't even resemble a burrito. Then, when I ask for an extra side of salsa, they give me one of those cups but don't even fill it up all the way. (I'm talking about a spoonful, that's it.)\n\nThere's another problem. The salsa is incredibly inconsistent. I get that it's made fresh or whatever, but sometimes it will be red, and other times orange like they put cream in it. One time it even had an odd consistency and it just looked like tomatoes mixed with twigs.\n\nMore recently, on Easter Sunday I went there for a burrito and they lost my ticket. So as I was sitting there for thirty minutes (literally, I kept track) with countless waiters passing me by without a word, I wondered what was taking so long.\n\nThey finally realized something had happened to it and made it, then said they were going to refund it back to my debit card. I'll admit, I thought that was pretty classy of them... But, it's still over two months later and I never got a refund.\n\nThen another time I wanted to see if anything else was better and tried a cinnamon roll. Not only was it incredibly dry and tasteless, but they used peanut butter frosting. It may just be because I despise peanuts...but I don't know... peanut butter frosting on a cinnamon roll doesn't make much sense to me, even if you're trying to be different.\n\nI don't care for their staff either, who I feel are standoffish. Won't be going back again."
2,"It was okay. Definitely overrated. However, I think half of the magic is the wait time. If you wait for anything for over 2hrs, you are starving by then, and it tastes incredible no matter what it is! Honestly though, the pistachio pizza is so unique, and equally delicious. And once inside, the chef/owner (?) made a stop over, was very professional and appreciative of our business, and it shows in the rest of the staff. It's not quite Italy, but then again, what is? Given the choice though, I would go to Federal Pizza over this one. More selections, better crust."
1,Typical college restaurant. Food was mediocre for me but a good choice for college kids.  Had the pizza and the artichoke dip.  It was recommended at not that good.
0,"I did not like this place at all.  My girlfriend found some decent reviews, so we decided to stay there.  I don't know what their normal rates are, but we were there during Cubs spring training, and the rooms were $80/night.  For that price, I was expecting something close to the level of a Best Western.  Doh...\n\nDon't be fooled by the \""Studios Suites\"" in the name.  Sure, is had a tiny kitchenette, but there wasn't anything \""sweet\"" about the room.  The carpet must have just been steam-cleaned before we got there because it was soaking wet.  The place seemed pretty old and the decor was drabby.  I didn't really want to touch anything in there, let alone sleep in the bed.  Not to mention that the volume on the TV wouldn't go down past a certain level, so we had to wrap a towel around the speakers.\n\nI would not stay there again."
1,"It was very crowded and the line was fairly long but it did move quickly. We got two small cheeseburgers and one large fry with two regular size drinks for $20, Yikes. The burgers were ok at best,The buns fell apart  about halfway through and the fries were horrible. I can think of plenty of places with better burgers for less money.  All in all FGBF's was a big disappointment and I will not go back. Gave it two stars for the quick way they handled the line and for the peanuts."
1,"Went for breakfast and wasn't impressed at all.  The people who work at DeLucas are not friendly and have a you should be happy I am serving you attitude.  If you are not a morning person then you shouldn't serve breakfast.  A smile and a good morning goes a long way.\n\nThe food was mediocre, greasy and lacking flavor. I ordered the California Omelette and it was something I could make at home with better flavor.  The chicken in the omelette had no taste and it was overlooked.\n\nOverall, I don't get the hype.  This is similar to a greasy diner.  Pamela's is the place for breakfast."
3,The chicken tacos are great I hate them two days in a row since I am not out here much.
0,"I have to down vote this business for a terrible customer service experience. \n\nOn a blazing hot Friday afternoon I left work early and drove all the way down to McDowell to pick up some toys for my dog. I walked up and saw the posted hours-- 4:30pm close, and my watch was just about at 4:30. I reached to open the door, unsure if it would be locked-- to my pleasant surprise, it was still open, I was so excited. The cashiers allowed me to head back to the warehouse-- again, I was relieved! I made a beeline for the toys and just a few feet before I reached them one of the workers pops out, literally stands in the middle of the aisle with his arms crossed (as if I were trying get backstage at a concert), and tells me the business is closed and that I had to leave. I told him that I just needed to grab a couple of toys, that I would need 2 minutes (under the circumstances, I would have been quick), but he wouldn't let me pass. When I politely persisted he asked me what toys I was interested in, and told me he would get them for me. I told him that I couldn't possibly know what they had in stock and that I just needed to visually see what they had (and how the heck do you describe some of these dog toys anyway??). No dice, he told me that I had to go. Really?? \n\nInflexible, embarrassing, and a total wasted trip. I was steamed. Rather than ask for a manager when I was agitated, I decided to drive home and email customer service. They emailed back the following Monday and told me, essentially, the employee did was he was supposed to do, blaming it on concern for customer safety with all of the heavy equipment they utilize after hours in the warehouse. Mind you that I had been let in building, that nobody stopped me from entering the warehouse, that it had maybe just turned 4:30, that there were other customers there, that there was no heavy equipment in sight and that I had asked for 2 minutes. They were perfectly fine with their employee telling me that I had to leave, and they made no effort to keep a repeat customer.\n\nBummer, I was so excited to learn of Ryan's Pet Supplies a couple of years ago-- and indeed, they have a great selection at terrific prices, I considered it worth the burden of driving into a bad area with restricted hours. I had given them all of my business ever since. Now I will never go back again, and I will let everyone know that Ryan's Pet Supplies couldn't care less about their customers."
1,"Wow - what an experience my wife and I had - \n\nFirst, we weren't planning on seeing a show, but happened to be in the casino when they were handing out discount passes to Zumanity, so we said, why not? The line at the box office was painfully slow, we had 3 people in front of us and it still took an hour...AN HOUR! Once we did make it to the clerk, she informed us the discount passes were not good for the show time we were able to make. Figures, isn't that how it goes! \n\nSo, I must say, the show itself is pretty impressive - very funny, amazing and entertaining. This review reflects nothing about the show itself - the performers were incredible.\n\nHere is the problem - the theatre staff/management. We were seated in front a group of drunken idiots who didn't speak english and apparently didnt understand what was happening around them. They were completely out of control. THEATRE STAFF DID NOTHING! We complained and were told it was our own fault, we should have asked to be reseated elsewhere! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!! We then asked for the manager, and she couldn't have been less helpful - she didnt care either, she told us they 'tried' to ask them to be quiet! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! YOU ASKED THEM TO BE QUIET?\n\nWe go no where with the theatre staff, so we went to hotel management. They couldn't care less. There are plenty of choices in Vegas - no need to ever step foot into New York New York again.\n\nMy apologies to the performers of Zumanity, you were amazing! You are the only reason this review doesn't get one star. It is unfortunate that your theatre staff don't care enough about other patrons - our experience was completely ruined."
1,"Just OK.  If you've never seen Elton John in the 80's, 90's, or 00's, then this is a great show for you.  However, for those of us that have seen him many times in prior years, this show is a dud.  First off, his voice is gone.  He struggles to get the tonal quality of all of his classics, and he loses so much from the effects and beauty of those greatest hits off 'Madman Across the Water\"" and \""Tumbleweed Connection\"".  Case in point, listening to him struggle with \""Your Song\"" made me want to cry.  On the positive side, I have never ever seen his piano playing hotter or more 'spot on' than I did last night. This was the greatest part of the show.  \n\nIn summary:  A true classic artist that's worth seeing if you haven't before.  Others like me just might end up cringing their way through it."
0,"I tried Chinese foods here and they really suck!! BBQ meats not fresh, I had stomach problem after had all you can eat BBQ at this place. If you see any new menus in Korean restaurants, don't ever try them. This place is great example. They just started Chinese foods and they prove so well, they can't cook at all. You don't even deserve 1 star for this review. Go to Baek Ri Hyang (Island Style restaurant in Sahara Ave) if you want Korean-Chinese food."
1,"Every time we come to Vegas we fulfill our crawfish cravings.  Up to this point we have only experienced Hot N Juicy crawfish.  After reading the reviews on boiling crab I felt confident we would have a great evening.  Sadly, that was not the case and at this point our experience has to be the worst dining experience we have had in 2012.   \n\nLet's start with the good.  We went on a Thursday and were seated right away.  We ordered a couple punds of crawfish 1 with the cajun spice 1 med and 1 mild some boiled shrimp and some fried shrimp and fries for our young son (2.5yrs).  \nThe boiled food all came out together and was prompt and tasted good to great no complaints here.  \n\nNow the bad. First, the fried food came out at least 10-15 minutes after the boiled food so I was left managing a hungry toddler trying to keep him out of the spicy food.  \nWe had to track down another server to get them to check on it.    Then we immediately ordered some additional boiled crawfish. After 15 to 20 minutes of no food and no server we sought someone out to figure it out. Another 10 minutes and our server shows up saying they must of sent our order to another table. She rushed our order and offered 25% discount. A nice gesture but sadly the poor service continued, as our toddler continued his downward spiral we tried to get our check and waited another 10 minutes.   Over all the service was lacking and inattentive.  \nThe food was good but I found the crawfish to be a tad overcooked and hard to peel. I probably wouldn't have noticed that if I wasn't already upset by the poor service.    The crawfish were large and flavorful but the sauce spicy levels were hard to distinguish.\n\n \n\nOverall a disappointing experience.  We are headed back to hot n juicy on this trip to salvage our crawfish dining experience."
0,"I don't understand why an intelligent human being would go to this place and consume the stuff that this place sells. It is of less quality than the stuff they feed inmates at that tent prison in Arizona...literally. What McDonalds does is take some low quality beef, add soy and other mixtures for filler, and then flavor it with addictive chemical flavorings that they make in a lab. Look into it if you don't believe me. \n\nI cringe when my kids want to go there. It's so foul and not to mention freaking expensive. It's totally unbelievable to me that people eat there!"
3,THE place to watch a sporting event in Vegas. Tons of seating and large TV's. My dream is to watch a big game here and rent a room with a pool table. Those rooms easily run a couple of thousand but one can dream. I love all the signed jerseys all over the place.
2,"Not really much I can say that would sway you to go or avoid the Bistro Buffet.  If you have never been to Vegas or never been to a buffet, you might be impressed.  Otherwise, it is a casino buffet, 'nuff said.\n\nBest thing is the variety.  We went for lunch and they had quite a selection.  Guess it was the time of year, but there was NO wait at all, we just paid, got seated, gave our drink orders, and started in.  Honestly don't even remember what we paid, but I have to say it was reasonable for the quality and choices offered.  Nice thing about a buffet is trying just a little of a lot of things.  Pretty standard buffet fare, so nothing is jarring my memory saying \""oh, don't forget to mention (insert food here) to fellow yelpers."
4,"As a resident of California I came to Arizona to visit family and friends over the holiday. Today is my last day in Chandler. Soon to be on a 5 hour drive home. I can't drive on an empty stomach, so I decided to try this place out. I order the steak breakfast burrito, and I must say it's quite filling. A white flour tortilla wraps the steak, fluffy potatoes, cheeder cheese, and caramelized onions all together. With a side of delicious salsa. A complete care package! If you're an \""on-the-go\"" type person, I highly suggest ordering the steak burrito. And after enjoying it, take a quick nap before you hit the road."
2,"I guess this is not a bad place for this side of town, however, it's definitely not the best place in town.  The fish is not as fresh and the rolls were literally falling apart. I guess they make it up by offering cheap prices for all you can eat... 18.95 for lunch and 21.95 for dinner. The staff was friendly and the service was fast! I would recommend the la boxing and maria roll there were both delicious!"
0,"I always give taco shops a fair shot! But omg..I think this place only stays in business because of surrounding bars! I was completely sober and having a craving...ate here for dinner one night. (can't speak for breakfast time)  Everything is watered down! From the chili sauces to the beans!! Taco shop looks like a cafeteria...very empty, nothing on the walls. The chicken was dark meat and mostly fat. I will not eat here again. Which is a shame because I live so close."
2,"I've eaten here one time, and I enjoyed a very decent meal.  I'm not really sure if I'll go back though, and I'll tell you why.  The place kind of gave me a strange vibe:\n\n-It didn't *feel* like a restaurant, it almost felt like a business that had turned into a restaurant.\n\n-The take-out menu/brochure was worded pretty peculiarly in places.\n\n-This one's hard to explain, but I sort of sensed some very subtle yet unsettling religious undertones throughout the whole experience.\n\nHad the China wrap.  It was kinda good, even if it did taste like homemade American teriyaki.  In a spinach tortilla.  With a side of yogurt.  --*sigh* Do you see what I mean?  A funny vibe.  I can't quite shake it.  Maybe I'll give it one more chance."
4,Best spot in town. This is such a romantic spot to take friends or even family. I fell upon this place over 4 years ago and i keep coming back. Love the wide selection of wine (that I can now drink) and the authentic Italian food. Great place to wine and dine without having to go to the strip. They have also just opened a second location at the Downtown Summerlin Mall. Right next door to me!
3,Great meat fish market...clean and friendly service!
3,Have eaten at the Jade Palace several times this past winter. Always excellent service and food. It gets busy on the weekends so plan ahead.
4,"One of the better Pho spots in Phoenix, Angelina's combines a high class appeal with great Pho and service.\n\nI was very pleased at the Rare Steak Pho. The meat was very high quality and they brought lots of extras, including fresh cilantro and Italian Parsley. The size was enough to be filling, even at a medium. Noodles were tasty and the broth was pleasant.\n\nThe sunflower shrimp appetizer was amazing. Very good way to start the dinner. The green tea was full of spices and had a unique taste that made it very good to drink.\n\nThe ambiance was very classy. My waiter was professional, courteous, and respectful. She came to our table just often enough to be perfect.\n\nDefinitely will be coming here again."
3,"My husband and I ended up at Table 10 by chance while wondering around the Palazzo trying to find a place for dinner.  The good news is that most people eat dinner super late on the strip, so we had no trouble getting a table at a normal dinner hour (around 6:00 P.M.).\n\nService was a bit slow at first but then got better.  They were not busy, so I'm not sure what the problem was.  I'd say we waited a good ten minutes to order drinks.  After that there was a dramatic improvement.\n\nI have mixed reviews to offer on the food.  I expected a better cocktail sauce to be served with the oysters.  In fact, we had much better oysters at a more reasonable price the next day at the Palace (right off the strip).  My husband's salmon was out of this world excellent--the best I've ever tasted.  On the other hand, my gumbo was nothing special.  That disappointed me, because of Emeri'ls BAM thing.  My gumbo definitely lacked the BAM factor.  Thankfully, I was saved by dessert.  We ordered and scarfed down the White Chocolate Malassadas, which are little donuts with white chocolate on the inside and cinnamon sprinkled on the outside.  Oh . . . my . . .God!!!!  Yes, they were THAT good."
1,"It's ok. If it's late and you want a place to eat, it's a good place to find some ok food."
4,"After hearing from multiple people how amazing this restaurant (and this location in particular) was, I decided it was time to try it out. \n\nThe feel of the place when you walk in is super authentic and welcoming, and the staff was some of the most attentive and polite service I've had at any restaurant in Vegas.\n\nThe House Margarita was delicious and a pretty decent size for the price ($8). The complimentary chips, dip & salsa are very good as well, the salsa has a good kick to it. The combo specialty plates are HUGE. More than enough for one person. Each plate comes with rice & beans plus fideo soup to start the meal. The soup was very flavorful and one of the highlights of the meal. I ordered the chicken enchilada, chicken taco & chicken tostada plate (Combo #6) and only ate half of everything. The person I was with ordered the beef enchiladas (both plates came with rice and beans, so a LOT of food) and he loved his meal as well. \n\nOne thing that should be noted is how AMAZING the view is overlooking The Strip. Definitely a major bonus for dining at this location. Everything was reasonably priced, the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic, and I will definitely be back."
3,"Wow, this place is awesome!  I'd heard about it a couple of months ago and my wife and I finally went last Saturday.  And then the next day.  That's how much we loved it.  It's a quaint, cozy place to get some coffee and relax.  Their cinnamon roll was great, especially the frosting!  The waffle sandwich with the Bechamel might be one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had.  The second day we went we took my wife's cousin Johnny and he loved the sandwich as well.  We are making a resolution to go to Bread and Butter every Saturday, or at least every other.  I definitely recommend it for a nice breakfast and I'm excited to try the lunch sandwiches."
0,"IF IT AINT BROKE DONT FIX IT.\n\nMe and my buddies go to vegas every June  for our annual. \"" DONT WAKE UP IN A THE HOSPITAL TRIP\""and we always end our trip at kaunaville. Kaunaville had a cover band that could possibly be th best cover band ive ever seen . The band has been playing there for the last three years . So needless to say , we were looking forward to ending our trip the way we all ways do ......at kahunaville. \n\nSo you can amagine how we felt when they told us management got rid of them because people were watching the band and not buying enough drinks ,I understand that money runs the world but the vibe in kahunaville is all wrong now . we tried to stay out of loyalty but we left 20 mins later\n\ni hope management reads this and get those guys back......PLEASE.\n\nIF IT AINT BROKE DONT FIX IT"
4,Best ravioli on the planet. Great fresh fish as well
2,"The food is really great. \n\nHaving said that, it's overpriced and they nickel and dime you on everything. Plus the portion sizes are really not big enough."
0,I don't eat at Mcdonalds after finding out the food is filled with GMO genetically modified organisms. Look up how dangerous this is. It's in most all food that is not labeled as organic b/c the Illuminati want depopulation. Look up Mike Adams at Natural News who has found fibers in the chicken McNuggets. These fibers look like the same plastic fibers that are coming out of people's skin who have morgellons disease. Which is not a disease but an intentional agenda to implant the population with nanotechnology fibers which are tracking devices and control devices that can send and receive radio wave frequencies for mind control and data mining the brain. Spread the word. IT's not just Mcdonalds it's all crappy food companies that have GMO. And fibers and nanochnology are the new danger found in foods etc.
0,"We had a partial lake view room in the spa tower.....\n\nThe Good.....\n1. Beautiful common areas\n2. Free\n3. The amenities rocked!!  In addition to the normal stuff, they also included hairspray, a toothbrush, bath salts and a loofa. (I am not sure if we were given extra stuff because we were on a suite floor or if this is usual)\n4. The Buffet (Yum!!)\n5. View of Paris from our room at night was stunning\n6. Fountain show\n7. (Steam) shower was large and had good water pressure\n8. Bose clock radio\n\nThe Bad.....\n1. Crowded common areas\n2. The room we reserved was sold out so we were downgraded\n3. Customer service was a little suspect; none of the employees went out of thier way to smile or be helpful \n4. The view of City Center from our room.  Yuck!!\n5. The room in the spa tower had two beds and one chair.  Only one of us could sit and watch the lake show at a time comfortably.  Seriously, could they not have put a second chair in the room?\n6. The toilet faces the shower and there isn't that much space between the two. This seemed like a bad layout.\n7. They piled the pillows in shams and the duvets that they (probably) use on the beds in the room.  (This is where the extra chairs should have been.) They never actually made the bed with these items durring our stay.  \n8. Television was small, had bad sound and was dated - 27 inch rear projection.  \n\nOverall, I don't think we would pay to stay in this hotel because we always felt that we were an after thought. We stayed at GVR and Palazzo during this trip and thought that there rooms were much nicer in those two hotels and we were treated much more kindly at both of those hotels."
4,"Our room faced the Bellagio shops which was absolute torture. I'm pretty sure when I die, heaven will reappear in this exact form (Chanel, Prada, Louis, Dior, Tiffany's). So when my friend told me she was considering purchasing a Prada bag, I almost died (of envy). \n\nSo we went into the store and the sales associate Charles Punzal was the absolute sweetest. He was patient and pulled practically every color option of saffiano leather totes we asked for. Definitely made the selection process a lot easier on us, and we left with the most gorgeous, black purse. \n\nWould recommend coming here and asking for Charles to help you out if you're thinking about making the financial plunge into timeless happiness."
4,"Seriously, awesome is all I can say. Chef Chris is so funny and friendly and he makes awesome sushi and sashimi! I used to love sushi narita in this same spot but I must say he out does them, awesome screaming o, great tuna sashimi  , this will for sure be a weekly visit, check them out you won't be sorry!"
2,"First and foremost ,you have to understand that you're eating Chinese food at a casino. If you can grasp that then your dining experience expectations will be dramatically different(meaning you have to  lower your standards; it's equivalent to a weekend of heavy drinking if you were single and you're looking to settle for the night minus the walk of shame in the morning). We dined here solely because my friend (the groom) really wanted his fix of noodles and wonton. \n\nFor those that are accustomed to a lower price point for similar food back home, they will most likely get a nice wake up call since the price point for the menu here is significantly higher (again you have to grasp the realization that you're dining at a casino). We ordered  the wonton, egg noodle soup; beef stew noodles; and the xiao long baos (soup dumplings). The wontons were suprisingly flavorful, the xiao long baos were decent although the texture of the dumpling skin was on the soggy side, and the beef stew would probably be the best dish we had. But for obvious reasons it's not food that I would wait on line for or anything.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous paragraph, the food wasn't the best, but when you're fiending for some Chinese food and you're in the middle of the desert, expect to pay a higher price point to somewhat get that fix. However, a full satisfaction of what you're yearning for may not be fully met. Nonetheless, it may just help hold you over till you head back to you respective go to Chinese place back home. It could be worse, what if there was only a P.F. Chang's or only  mall type of a take out that was around? Bottomline, the place is serviceable to somewhat meet your fiending needs of rice or noodles."
0,"We didn't even stay to eat.  The place has great curb appeal.  That didn't save the trip.\n\n1.  Staff was not friendly.  Only two people were on duty.  One was standing behind the counter staring into space or watching TV.  The other was sitting down eating.\n\n2.  Doesn't appear to be too clean.\n\n3.  Pricey for a little hole-in-the wall place.  Not a sit down restaurant and some of the dishes are $10!\n\n4.  They serve \""off\"" food.  Tongue.  Other weird assorted animal parts.\n\nWe stayed, read the entire menu, and then I whispered, \""Olive Garden?\"" and we left.  Not worth a trip."
2,"One of the hottest restaurants around is located within Eureka Casino on East Sahara. Before Fat Choy, Chef Sheridan Su (former executive chef at Comme Ca) was serving Great Bao in the most unlikely place; a nail salon. I never tried it back then because I have an aversion to the smell. Dining with salon fumes never seemed appetizing in the least bit. I never tracked down the food truck, and it's taken me sometime to travel to the eastside, but I've finally done it. The Eureka Casino was nicer than I expected and I had heard interesting characters patronize the casino. However, on Sunday afternoon it was clean, quiet and no characters in sight. Not sure what it says about me, but I felt right at home. We strolled back to Fat Choy and took a seat. \n\nThe waitress brought over menus; they had a limited selection and no rice or noodle dishes. We selected the duck bao ($7), and the tofu mushroom bao ($6) after she suggested it over the pork belly ($7). We also ordered the short rib grilled cheese ($10) and the nutella roti ($6) for dessert. We chose a plain old diet coke and diet dr. pepper from their new soda machine with dozens of flavors. Our bao came out first. Duck and pork belly were brought out. The order was wrong, but we stuck with it. The buns are steamed to perfection. The pork belly was fantastic, the fat rendered perfectly so it was rich, tender and filled with that wonderful pork flavor. I loved the freshness from the cilantro and greens, and the texture of the crushed peanuts. This was indeed great bao. The duck was delicious too. The hoisin sauce was light and didn't overwhelm the duck at all. Now, I'm curious how the mushroom and tofu bao would be. Tasty, I'm sure. \n\nThe short rib grilled cheese comes with provolone and cheddar, onion jam and a side of marinara sauce. I'm a purist when it comes to grilled cheese; I'd prefer it with only one type of cheese. I thought the two cheeses made it a bit greasy, the sourdough bread grilled beautifully and the short rib was tender and flavorful with the onion jam. The marinara was thick from the tomato paste. Again, not my preference, but still all the components make and enjoyable sandwich. My husband liked it just fine. My tastebuds just didn't concur. There was nothing notable about the fries. \n\nThe Nutella Roti had me intrigued, nutella, mascarpone, honey and walnuts on roti... what's not to love? The wait, as it turns out. We waited and waited and waited. We would've cancelled had our waitress been around. She conveniently disappeared. We waited and waited some more. It was ridiculous. We asked the other waitress and she said it would be right up. We waited and waited. Finally, the pancake topped with goo was brought to the table. The pancake was incredibly greasy, aside from that the flavors were pretty good, but definitely not worth the wait. I could be more forgiving if it were busy, but we were one of three tables. I'd hope they weren't that far in the weeds with seven diners.\n\nOur patience wore thin; we refused to be held hostage for our bill so my husband went to the counter to take care of it. The eats are pretty darn tasty. I'd return for more bao and I'd love to try the duck rice and potstickers. I certainly hope service will be improved."
3,Great experience here with the food and service. Our group ordered the chicken and waffles and this pork dish. When they say the portions are huge it's an understatement. The food was tasty and the service was friendly. Really glad I was able to try it.
4,"An amazing find.  We were leaving lunch and just stumbled on this place...  I went RIGHT for the handbag section.  Chanel, Louie...  they have it all.  In great condition.  I ended up scoring the most amazing Tod's bag at a steal of a price and my friend got a dress that would have easily cost $500 at Barney's for like $70.  \n\nStaff is incredible and so friendly.  They also get subtle hints about how much you're willing to pay.  I was coveting a Chanel bag that was out of my price range but they noticed me spying another Chanel and subtly said, \""This one is reasonably priced\""...  in a way that didn't make me feel like a pauper.  \n\nIf you're near this place or traveling to Scottsdale, check out this store.  You won't regret it.  And you probably won't leave without one of their cute yellow shopping bags!"
3,"There's nothing i can really complain about. Maybe that it's so good and popular you wait a little bit because the menu is so good and there's lots of people! LOL! The Halibut Sashimi is great, the Charlie Sheen Roll is good, Crab Salad is YUM... Have some Sake and enjoy good Sushi for the price..."
3,"So, I work on the radio and I drive EVERYWHERE from gig to gig. When I drive down Rt 51, I make it a point to leave myself \""enough time\"" to stop & eat at Tavern 51. Want a steak hoagie that isn't steak em's? You're in luck, I ordered mine medium rare and it was! I went local the last time I was there and had perogies. They were exactly what I expected in Pittsburgh, great! The only reason they get 4 outta 5 is; although they list the kitchen hours as:\n\nMon. - Thu. 11:30am til 10:00pm\nFriday 11:30am til 11:00pm\nSaturday 4:00pm til 11:00pm\n\nTwice I've arrived mid-afternoon and had to wait for the cook to arrive. \nPS. I think the cook & afternoon bartender may be husband & wife (maybe the owners), but that's speculation....\n\nThey NOW accept credit cards, but NOT Discover. \n\nLast, but not least in my book... They serve COKE! \nJack & Diet Coke is a 1000 times better than Jack & Diet Pepsi!\n\nNuff said!\n\nDig"
0,"Avoid this Walgreens. I went in to buy a bag of candy and a can of beer. The stupid cashier at the front says she cant ring up alcohol cause shes underage. Sends ne to cosmetic counter where i waited 10 minutes cause the idiot cashier there had a customer who mid transaction goes back to pick out more stuff. Instead of canceling what she rung up and ringing up my 2 items since that customer was not ready and still shopping says to me...\""oh if u cant wait go to the pharmacy to ring u up\"". I take my 2 items and go to the 3rd counter they sent me to and the pharmacist says \""i cant ring up alcohol\"". Wtf. Im sure next he woulda said go to the photo counter. right?! And still no one can ring up one can of beer. Idiots. They should all be fired and the mgr that hired them too. Boycott."
4,"I will never take my vehicles anywhere else! This is the best, most honest and great Company. Thanks!!!!!"
2,"I have a love hate relationship with this place. The service historically is not that great , which is why I sit at the bar. \n\nThe bar tenders know what they are doing and will take care of you. So thats No.1 sit at the bar. \n\nThe food isn't bad, but the Meatloaf melt is awesome but will probably blow a hole in your colon. It's so good though, it's sort of a hangover in itself. So that's No.2 Meatloaf melt = Delicious Colon Canon. \n\nTUESDAYS, TUESDAYS, TUESDAY...is all day $2.50 Pints nights. It's the best deal on the south side. So No.3 is drink here all day and night on Tuesday because it's super cheap.\n\nP.S. I'm also the Mayor on Foursquare so stick that in your pipe and smoke it."
2,"Met a friend for lunch here yesterday. We came here as I had a coupon and it is close to where I work. \nWe were seated right away. It did a while for the server to come over, but once he did it was rather quick service. \nI ordered the fried chicken. And to my surprise it was pretty good. The chicken was moist, the skin crispy and crunchy, good flavor. it was way too much food for one person. Took half back to work. \nMy friend had the German crepes and loved them. \nAll in all a good enjoyable lunch. \nI would go back."
4,"I used to think Bobby Flay was overhyped and cocky.\n\nNow I know why he is.\n\nHis food is BOMB.\n\nI've been here twice, let me break down the experiences.\n\n1)  Had the 22 ounce bone in rib eye.  Meat = perfect(I got medium), Sauces = perfect complements, and pre-dinner bread = bomb.  There was a side that I'm not too sure if they still serve for dinner, but it was some kind  of corn dish, and it was AMAZING.  All in all, worthy of the 60+ $ spent to enjoy high class cookery.\n\n2)  Had to hit it up for some BRUNCH, YO!\nA group of us all ordered different things and all dishes were amazingly unique for being brunch type dishes.  I got the Burger, and for only a couple more bucks than a Denny's burger, it was worth it.  Friends got the chilequiles(bomb) and enchiladas(bomb).  Others ordered too but didn't get a chance to try them all.  Again, the bread was very good to start out with.\n\nOne con... PEPSI is served here... =/  A coke would have made this meal exponentially better.\n\nAnyways,  I recommend it completely if you have not experienced it!"
1,"I give the food 4 stars; it's pretty decent although it is pricey for what you get.  But hey, it is the Strip after all.\n\nThe service I give 1/2 star (thus the average of about 2 stars).  We watched time and again as our waiter breezed past our table, without so much as a glance toward our empty glasses, in order to pander to larger groups.  Obviously he thought he was going to get bigger tips from them...turns out he was right.  It didn't have to be that way though.  \n\nHere is my tip to the Red 8 wait staff:  Don't make the customers ask you for everything; if all their glasses are empty ask them if they need some more water or another drink.  If they would like to box up the uneaten portion of their dinner, box it all up instead of half.  Ask them if they'd like dessert or anything else before you drop the check on their table.  Most importantly, even if your opinion is to the contrary, treat them as if they deserve to be dining in your fine restaurant."
4,"I've had Bar + Bistro bookmarked for about a year. Finally went two weeks ago and have been there three times since.\n\nI highly suggest ordering a latte with breakfast. A fabulous surprise was the crispy pancakes. There are about five items on the breakfast menu. The omelet was okay. I probably wouldn't revisit it.\n\nThe steak salad at lunch is wonderful. For $12 you get a filling assortment of pumpkin seeds, blue cheese, eggs, avocado, tomatoes, and grilled steak. \n\nFor dinner I tried their version of sorullitos. Holy cow. This is the reason I returned twice. These things are the distant, beautiful cousins to the ones you get in Puerto Rico. The cousin everyone wants, but no one can have, because, well, it's family and that'd be wrong. But here, it's okay. Eat the corny fried thing with the secret spicy sauce. \n\nGuess the thing that puts Bar + Bistro above the rest is the atmosphere. It's real. Authentic. It has hurricane furniture, the kind that doesn't move when a storm hits because it's the real deal, welded together by an artist. My dad welds. Service can be spotty but I don't mind because I've got stars in my eyes.\n\nBar + Bistro is what community tastes like, looks like."
1,Fries where not good at all. Kind of mushy and weird seasoning. They charge for ranch. The burger was nothing to brag about. I had to ask for ketchup. Coupon made it worth a try- tricky parking lot to pull our of to make a left hand turn.
1,"I'm a huge foodie so I guess I'm a pretty tough critic, but this place just missed the mark for me.  I saw it was listed 3rd best new restaurant in Phoenix magazine so I decided to try it. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Good atmosphere.  The service was just ok.  The food was very interesting, but the flavors were just not there. The edamame was charred and had a very burnt flavor, which I guess is what they were going for.  Would not order it again.  I had just had Mexican street corn the other day at Taco Gulde, and it was way better than sumomayas. I got the chile garlic crab noodles.  All I could taste was chile oil and a burnt flavor again. Not good at all.   I work at one of the best sushi restaurants in Scottsdale, so I didn't even bother trying the sushi. TOYAMA restaurant= best sushi in the valley. Hidden gem.   We heard the table next to us rave about the tres leches cake so we decided to get it. One of the worst tres leches I've ever had.  Gooey marshmallow on top of the cake, with chewy old tasting chocolate rice Krispy treats, in a nasty condensed milk/tapioca flavored sauce.  Whoever came up with this dessert has the palate of a 10 year old.  Not very sophisticated flavors. Will not be returning.  You want good Mexican food, go to the Mission in old town Scottsdale, or the barrio cafe in Phoenix. You want good Asian food, come visit me at Toyama. You want the worst of both worlds, go to sumomaya."
4,I followed Jillian to Volr salon and I love it there! Jillian always has creative new colors and styles for me to try out. I leave feeling beautiful every time and I get many compliments on my hair. Everyone wants to know where I get my hair done and I always point them to Jillian at Volr!
4,"My husband and I are locals, we went here for our anniversary on a Saturday night. It was our first time and it was great. The waitress was so nice and the food was amazing. Great beer selection as well. We had a nice quaint table outside and loved being able to sit outside and eat!"
3,"If I can take the chefs of Ichiza and open a new and bigger restaurant with trained servers, hostesses, etc... I would probably have one of the best Asian restaurants in all of Las Vegas. \n\nThe issue with Asian restaurants in general is the poor service. It can really put a damper in your dining experience. Instead of hiring experienced waitresses who can clearly understand what you're saying and be attentive throughout the meal, many Asian joints hire their nieces and/or other family members, or perhaps even random attractive Asian girls. \n\nLet's just say, Ichiza... you have phenomenal Japanese food. Authentic and not overpriced, with an extensive variety offered all over the walls and on the menu. Your ramen is definitely better than Monta's (at least that's my opinion). I will always crave your curry udon, pork and onion skewers, fresh oysters, and pretty much everything else offered in that tiny space of a restaurant ;)   But please, please, please work on the service aspect! \n\nOn the several occasions I've been to this restaurant, my group and I waited about 15+ min to be approached after seating. We watch hungry and thirsty as the 2 or 3 waitresses on duty walk by, bus tables, stare at other tables, giggle in the back, or just plain stand around. We usually have to flag someone down to inform her that we're ready to order and once we do, we feel rushed and it is rather difficult to communicate half the time. The food takes a little longer than the average Asian restaurant, which is ok... but once it's out, don't expect to see your waitress again. Or.. you will see her walking around, but she won't acknowledge your existence. Good luck on refills! \n\nLast night was a prime example. We had 4 of us in the group. We finally ordered our dishes, they came out after some time, then we had a 5th join us. Long story short, he did not have a chance to order anything at all, not even a glass of water. \n\nNeedless to say, this place has fabulous food, and it's adorable on the inside... very Japanese :). Workers are polite but lack any restaurant experience. I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars strictly due to service! I sure hope that aspect improves because then it would certainly be a 5 star experience all around!"
0,"Store manager Clinton does not represent Michael Bollig's vision of friendly or professional as stated on the website. Clinton was extremely rude, disrespectful, and accusatory. While arranging the delivery of my dryer we encountered a miscommunication and the coordination of delivering my dryer became complicated. Instead of Clinton taking responsibility for the miscommunication he made every excuse in the book and tried to pass the blame onto me. As I tried to explain the situation he talked over me, raised his voice and was very condescending. I expressed my dissatisfaction with his lack of customer service; however he did not seem to care. On the other hand, the delivery driver was very nice and accommodating. He waited over an hour for me to get home to make up for the miscommunication. I appreciated that greatly and displayed my gratitude with a tip. I was disappointed to notice a ding on my wall from the installation of my dryer after he left. I guarantee Clinton has cost B&B Appliances a lot of money by his lack of customer regard and therefore loss of future business. He could definitely benefit from some coaching regarding customer service and professionalism. I never post on yelp, but here I am 9 hours later still astonished by the worst customer service I have EVER encountered. \n\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130604134550-284615-15-statistics-that-should-change-the-business-world-but-haven-t"

4,This place is awesome. I always find an awesome find when I come in. I very rarely see small comic shop's anymore but this place is great. Whenever I go in the people who work there are just hanging out in the back but if you need help they're always glad to help you.
2,"This store was pretty clean and had some pretty good deals, especially with several racks of red tag clearance items this past weekend. I had an issue with the checkout process, however, which is why I can't give them 4 stars. For buying only 2 items we were at the registers for what felt like 15 min because the associate couldn't figure out how to scan my items. I guess one of the stickers was messed up and wouldn't scan correctly....but rather than go and grab another one that had a good tag or manually key in the sku or numbers on the tag, she spent 5 min trying to peel the sticker and then stepped away without any explanation for 5-10 min and then came back with a new tag she had made for it. Hopefully she was just a new employee and next time this won't happen"
3,"I've been here twice for brunch and really enjoyed it. The Veggie Island breakfast was delicious, good coffee, and prompt friendly service."
3,"I would go here again, but pretty much just for the pizza cookie and the cheese filled ravioli's!! We ordered the thin crust Aunt Margaritas pizza, and when it came, we didn't like it very much. The crust seemed very dry to me. So we called the waitress over, and they made us another pizza, gave us a free appetizer (the ravioli's). Woohooo for two free pizzas! The waitstaff all have cute sayings on the back of their shirts (Legalize Marinara) and we were greeted by multiple people. Our dessert was out of this world. Soft, gooey, melty, delicious humongous chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. My mouth is watering."
0,"Well, been to Kneaders a handful of times since this location opened. GREAT food, terrible service. Today while in drive- I was greeted by a rude employee- not a friendly voice. \nWhen I got to the window, I sat there for 4 minutes until someone came to the window and gave me my total... Not even a hello, good morning or apology about the wait!!!! I then had to wait another 2 minutes for my drink and daughters kids meal. I was told there was a straw for her drink in the bag, when I asked... Only to realize when I left, Nope no straw! \n\nI also ordered a cinnamon roll and I didn't get it! \n\nWow- not a good experience at all!!!!!"
2,Sound is a bit bouncy & shrill here. SouthPoint south-most bar has great football sound.  From Super Bowl Sunday...
4,"Been coming here for years. I love love love this place!! Their 'The Works' skillet is amazing and so is their French Toast. It's made with a delightful custard batter that can put a smile on anyone's face. To be frank, all of their food is great. The service is stellar too!! You see a lot of the same people. During the week, they have a great breakfast special. There is no reason to come eat here!!"
1,"This was my home gym for a while. Until they switched up management. The place has fallen apart. Manager is rude. Machines are old. It's simply not kept up anymore. Sad because it WAS such a great gym, people were serious about working out there. If you live in the NW area take your money to lvac over the bridge, there is plenty room and equipment and cleaner."
0,They don't have the usual great subway service that you would expect from a subway. Ive been in multiple tines and employees have not had a uniform. No great and they are mean when attend to you. I recommend the service at jersey mikes better.
3,"The best value downtown hands down. Friendly helpful staff, clean as a whistle, close to a lot if great places to eat. My only complaint was that there was no soap/shampoo holder in the shower. I will definitely go back."
3,"Very good BBQ here.  I wouldn't say it's \""the best\"", but it's right up there.  It's family owned, which is a big plus for me.  They also have homemade root beer!  It's a little on the pricey side.... expect around $10/person.  Another plus is their BBQ sauce does not contain gluten."
0,"I have never heard of Via Delosantos but my sister told me the food was amazing and she was shocked I have never heard of this place. While I was waiting to be seated I pulled up Yelp on my phone and started reading reviews. Arik B's review was funny as hell but also scared the shit out of me. The chips and salsa were good but not great. The rice and beans were blah. The vegetarian chalupa had a lot of guacamole on it topped off with lettuce and cheese. I can't believe they even serve this on the menu it's horrible. My cheese enchilada topped of with their white queso sauce was really good so if I ever get dragged to this place again I will order that. During dinner my sister mentioned that she has seen roaches in the restaurant while she was eating and In my head I was thinking \"" Dammit Arik B was right\""!"
4,Awesome I will be returning!!
2,"If this is the best \""Kosher Style\"" deli that Phoenix has to offer, then it's good. When compared with other deli's I've rated in New York, Las Vegas and Detroit... It's Meh to poor. Pastrami was too fat, pickles too salty. Decent sized sandwich priced a little high."
1,So disappointed.  My husband and I decided to have a little stay-cation because I am 8 months pregnant with twins.  Upon a riving to the hotel we were under the impression we would be greeted by vallet. Surely one of the great hilton hotels would have someone to park cars on a busy Saturday afternoon.  NO there was no one outside. Secondly the front desk gal was very friendly.  Good greeting she educated me on the package my husband had bought as I checked us in while he was parking the car. After I checkled in  I looked for someone to help me with our bags. Again no one there to help. So With a luggage cart in hand I found the elivator....ok so now you are telling me there is not even someone to help me get this thing to the 8th floor . When I got to the room they key card  that i was given didn't even unlock the door. So that meant toting the same bulky luggage cart back to the elevator back down stairs though the lobby. While 8 months pregnant mind u. I had it. I called my husband he came up to the room and went down stairs to get a new card. I checked out the room nothing extraordinary.  But I was jus ready to relax except I found old french fries in the couch and a dead fly on the bed....we will not be returning to the hilton.  For 200$. This has been a craptastic experience.  I really wish I had jus booked a room at the Sheraton or the local holiday inn.

1,"We know the FOX is clever, the restaurant concepts they come up with are like little magical yellow bricks down the yellow brick road that is lead by the Peter Piper and when one opens, people gather.\nI love the concept of the Yard, group seating, plenty of games to play . . . and there were plenty of groups there.  \nNow I know FOX is deft and any restaurant is all about maximizing the potential for the almighty drinks and serving of food.  \nUnfortunately, at the Yard, service of food and drinks failed miserably.  There were a large group of us Elite Yelpers there with our friends celebrating some Dec. birthdays . . . yet, there weren't enough seating and I seriously stood there for almost 2 hours and not ONCE did a waiter come by and ask me if I wanted anything to eat or drink.  And I was more than ready to order something to eat and drink!!!\nAll those potential loss of revenue I saw all around me.  I'm thinking, \""if they would do the order and deliver system differently, the nightly intake would certainly double if not more!\""\nI don't know what the solution is, but if I were FOX, I would send someone FOXY and brainy to spend some time to analyze the situation and come up with a procedure where the plentiful patrons are serviced because at the end of the day, you are still running a restaurant and not a free playground for the grownups."
1,"At times I get overwhelmed and I struggle coming up with catching words to have my followers get my point. Every burger should be made by an american chef. All due respect Chef Ramsay but your burGR is horrible. Wow. the wife and I were so excited that we made reservation @this burger joint a.k.a. GR BurGr restaurant located inside the Planet Hollywood hotel on the vegas strip BLV. \n\nWe both were so excited, we decided to order the Wings/ Japano poppers. The wings were super nasty and frozen b4 deep fried. and way too dry. Chef Ramsay can be such a hypocrite at talking S*** at all the other restaurants for \""entertainment\"" yet his own restaurants are suffering in both quality foods and services. Shame on the restaurant for using frozen foods for customers that are paying high dollar for their foods. \n\nThe waitress kept on apologizing to us on how he's so \""busy\"" and that our burgers should be served soon. He was able to bring me and the wife our drinks but yet no refills. I mean am having a beer, I like to keep the buzz going during and after my meal. If he/she stop serving beer, the buzz will go away... So, yes the buzz went away after 20mins waiting for my beer. \n\nThe next bigger issue I had was my burger was over cooked. i asked for medium well burger, to be juicy from the inside and crispy from the outside. The burger was so overcooked and dried I stopped after the 2nd bite. I told the waitress about the issue, and he said \""Awww am so sorry.\"" He also added, \""I'll make sure this will not happen next time.\"" Umm... who is stupid enough to do the mistake again twice? Call me a fool once but don't you dear call me a fool again!! \n\nWhat a waste of $87 for two people that was at this restaurant. I cant even be funny or have a sense of humor writing this because of the disappointment I had w/ the wife at our wedding anniversary night. \n\nAnyway, I wouldn't go back even if Chef GR himself gave me his sincere apology. That is how bad this place was and the sadness it caused us two. \n\nGrade: F and \""bloody horrible mate\"" as the good english GR would say. Overall, me and the wife admired him and his shows the past few years. After dinning in at one of the many restaurant he has in the United States we lost all respect to him as a chef and an entertainer as well."

0,"I read the reviews and should have steered away...but it looked interesting.  Salad was wilted, menus are on the wall, with no explanation so you are ordering blind, service was NOT with a smile from the bartender to the waitress, to the server who helped the waitress, and the waitress never checked back to see how everything is.  Terribly overpriced for what you get, and as an Italian, this does not even pass for a facsimile thereof!  Stay away for sure.  I only gave them one star, as I had to fill something in, they should get no stars!"
2,"When I heard this place has beignets, I was completely sold. I have been craving beignets for so long, you'd think there would be more places that serve them! Anyway, I came here on a Friday morning and parking was not difficult to find. It was just street parking so bring quarters for the meter. The place wasn't too busy, there were plenty of open tables, but we still waited close to 10 min. \n\nFood wise, we had to get the beignets to start. When they came, they were smaller than expected. They're also denser than I like, but still quite good. They reminded me of a sugar doughnut hole. The best part of them was the seasonal jam and vanilla scented mascarpone as the dipping sauces. I put so much of those on, it was like eating the dipping sauces with a side of beignet. \n\nFor the rest of the meal, the 2 others joining me had the Two Eggs any style with the smashed potatoes, while I tried the Chilaquiles. The Two Eggs any style was nothing to write home about. It was exactly as described, two eggs any style, a slice of bacon, bread, and some potatoes. The \""smashed potatoes\"" were just cubed potatoes with some seasoning, which was a bit lacking. We all thought it was overpriced since nothing was particularly outstanding. My Chilaquiles was pretty tasty, it was essentially scrambled eggs with tomatoes and peppers over tortilla chips, a sort of breakfast nachos. But the chicken sausage that was sitting on top was a bit too sweet for the dish, it just stood out too much. \n\nThe staff was fairly friendly, however the one waitress that brought our check was not exactly rude, but she had some attitude when holding the check out for us. She didn't say anything, but from her body language, she looked annoyed at us for no reason. \n\nOverall, this place was alright. It's a decent breakfast spot but I don't think there's much here to actually crave."
0,"worst PJ's ever!\n\nI've ordered from this particular PJ's three times and each time there's been something bad. First time they forgot to make one of the three pizzas we ordered. Second time was a delivery that was supposed to be delivered within 30 minutes but arrived an hour later. Third time they were extremely rude when we went to pick up the order. They assumed I was someone else when I had walked in the door and barked \""5 minutes\"" at me. 5 minutes what? The F you talking about? He thought I was someone who had called in earlier... what a douche.\n\nAll three times they never had peppers or cheese. I will never again return back to this PJ's."
0,"Terrible! \n\nI'm pretty sure I am the apartment above Serena R's review.  The time frame matches up well.  \n\nI moved in around August 2010 to a first floor apartment (with a lower level Apartment below me)  Within the first weeks of my arrival, maintenance people were at my door nearly every time I tried to shower.   \n\nI'm a young girl, living alone, with guys unceremoniously entering MY HOME every time my shower leaks!   Originally, they tried to convince me I wasn't closing my shower curtain... but then a started collecting crocks full over debris and water from behind the shower plumbing access door.  THEY tried to convince me that cups full were purely pipe condensation.   It took 6 months for them to resolve this situation. At one point, they even asked me NOT to use the shower.  \n\nA year later, the ceiling in my bedroom began to leak.  The wall began to crack and before long a grotesque, pink mold covered the backside of the layers of tan paint that fell from my walls and ceiling.  I was spending most of time out of town with a family illness when I noticed this happening.  When I stopped by the office to pay my rent, I talked to 3 people about what was happening... nothing was corrected UNTIL they started showing my apartment to potential tenants.  \n\nI used my apartment as essentially a storage unit until my lease expired."

I advised her that the weather didn't bother me.  Two more times she tried to discourage me (without offering alternatives).\n\nI ordered a hot almond milk boba, which took about three minutes for staff to make.  I did enjoy the drink, however, but as another poster advised, the place does not feel clean.  \n\nThere are a lot of options for drinks.  I had to ask for a frequent buyer card, but this place is one that I can take or leave in comparison to other boba drink selling places in town."

2,Had a great time staying here right after I got married but when I went to my room to check in I entered in a room with people already in it which has never happened to me before. The hotel really booked me in a suite that already had customers still in it. I specifically booked that suite to enjoy a pre honeymoon weekend with my husband. They ended up changing our room to another suite (not the same one as booked) which was ok but I still wanted to be booked in the room with the jacuzzi. The hotel is beautiful and the food was good so I think they just need a better check in system because it took them FOREVER to figure out the situation once we told them the room they gave us was already occupied. Shouldn't take 30 minutes to decide what to do.

3,"This is a good venue for an event or a medium sized party- I was here for the Yelp event a few months ago. From what I gathered, this part of the bar is exclusive to events like the one we had. There was a front area with a bar with some very good tap selections. The back was a bit more open area and some bathrooms in the very back. The staff was incredibly friendly and the booze very good. I've been looking into places to have a big 30th birthday celebration, and depending on how much an event would cost here I would definitely consider the space."
1,"First of all, an hour after we ordered we get our food. Service was slow. My friends top priced item in the place for prime rib was not cooked for perfection and was just  rare and un-eatable! She had to call waiter to have it cooked a little bit more which took long. My burger was not the best as the flavor was more on the sauce and cheese than the burger itself. It was 5 times the price of my regular burger. Everything was salty. We had the bone marrow which was salty or maybe it was the bread and side was salty...the only think I liked was my calamnsi drink....I would not recommend the place if you want taste."
4,"As a resident of South Scottsdale, this is a true gem.  The food is fresh and crazy good.  They are creative and farm to table I believe is truly what they are.  The cocktail program is spot on if you want to enjoy true craft spirits.  The service is 5 star and you never get disappointed."
3,The place is easy to find and easy to access but quite tiny as it's only a small cafe sizes room.  The food is good and they do give vegan and vegetarian options for most items.  For vegans it's slightly more expensive as vegetarian options are a dollar less but can contain egg.  I tried an appetizer which was the spicy nagaimo and it was pretty good but not sure for 5 dollars and the spicy dice chicken (soy) and it was awesome.  I like my vegetables a little raw and crunchy however so they cooked it for me right.  The service was pretty good but the people were not around most of the time and only when I needed them.  Note: CASH ONLY!  Good thing I had a 20 on me before going or I'd be washing a few dishes.
1,THE ORDER:\nFrozen Hot Chocolate (what a rip off)\n\n\nYYYIIPPPEEE:\nIt was 110 & it was cold\n         that is the best thing i can say\n\n\nBBBOOO\n& i thought Starbucks was expensive\n       Frozen hot chocolate ($8) = Mocha Frappuccino ($4)\n\n\nSUMMARY:\nNothing special\n       go to McDonalds & get an Iced Mocha ($2)
0,"They are saving money by doing the first coat of polish with some crappy off brand in a similar color. The polish looks really bad, the impurities in the crappy polish are showing. Not recommended."
3,"The burgers themselves were okay, I wasn't necessarily a big fan of the bun because I wish it had been toasted, but instead it was super soft- I guess more of a style preference.  I had the Kalbi burger and the Ronin burger on two separate occasions.  I think the Ronin burger tasted better than the Kalbi burger.\n\nDidn't particularly like the parmesan truffle fries as much compared to Umami Burger.  These fries were very messy to eat with and weren't as tasty.\n\nThe ox-tail chili cheese fries were interesting.  There was a spicy kick to it and it was definitely unique.\n\nOverall, I think there is a lot that can be said about these interesting combinations for burgers.  Give it a try and see if you like 'em!"
3,"Decent selection, fair prices, but could use more folks at the checkout lanes, or at least a process whereby they call up more employees to help out quicker."
4,"Gawd. Best morning ever. Waking up and realizing you went to Ian's, and there's still some in the fridge.\n\nI never go to Madison without stopping at Ian's at least once. Unlike others, I've never been a huge fan of the mac 'n' cheese slices. I'd never turn down a bite, but I rarely order a whole slice of it for myself because I find it less interesting than the other flavors. \n\nI do, however, enjoy anything with roasted red peppers, pesto or olive tapenade, plus all the Mexican ones, steak and fries (with BBQ) and the buffalo chicken. There's always a bunch of sauces and sprinkles (cheese and red pepper) to add to your 'za after you get it, so I spend some time there before finding a seat in the restaurant or on the curb outside.\n\nIt's hard to choose, and my college roomie and I were both into sharing, so we I had a system. We would order three slices between the two of us and then have them cut all of them in half. It was legendary, always getting to try three kinds for the price of one and a half. Highly recommended.\n\nThis bigger location on State St. seems to run smoothly every time I've been there, and I always get a kick out of the fact that they have Yelp stickers everywhere.\n\nFor late-night food, Ian's is as good as it gets... anywhere."
2,"Yes, I'd say A-OK for Stanley's.  Their sausages range from okay (kabanosy) to quite good (spicy kolbasz) but I'd agree that they're a bit on the pricy side.  \nI usually patronize their Bell Rd. location as it's closer to my house, but I ate lunch here a few weeks ago since I was in the 'hood.  It was right before Christmas and the place was JAM packed with everyone getting their holiday goodies.  The kielbasa sandwich was fine, they also have subs and other cold cut type sandwiches.\nThough they don't really hold a candle to some of the awesome Polish deli's back in Chicago, it's probably about the best you'll find out here in Phoenix."
3,"Yum!!! This review is based on their milkshakes. Spiked milkshakes that is. After dinner, my friends and I went to the bar and wanted to try their milkshakes. My friend and I split the captain crunch milkshake. It is definitely better to share. It can be very heavy and they give you more than just one cup of it. They give you the left overs in another cup. You can definitely taste the alcohol in the shake, but it's not heavy enough that you will feel it unless you are low tolerance.\n\nI also got to try and grasshopper and the oreo shakes. Both of them were great as well. You can walk into the bar and seat yourself. We got there about 8:15pm and it was busy busy on a Friday night! \n\nNext time, I do want to try their food. :)"
2,"As far as budget accommodations go this place was alright.  The staff is friendly, helpful and flexible.  The dorm rooms themselves probably try and pack a few too many people in to them and the beds can be a very squeeky.  It's located a 7 or so minute walk from the heart of Old Town, which if you're staying for more than 3 or so nights can get a little repetitive.  \n\nOverall I'm sure better could be found, but if nothing appeared in a search I'd come back here with no real hang ups"
3,"It's hard not to write a good review of a place when you order one pizza and end up with two.  Both being about twenty times the size you thought that they would be.  Wow, that two for one special they have really rocks.\n\nThe pizza itself is definitely of higher quality than a lot of other places I've been around herein the Valley.  The cheese melted properly so that it doesn't slide off the second you bite into it.  The toppings all taste fresh, not like they were sitting in a cooler for the past week.  The pepperoni is a bit greasy but, if you're ordering pepperoni, you're not allowed to complain about that.\n\nGive it a try.  It's good quality and you don't feel like you're harming your body by eating it."
3,This is a really good restaurant!  A must try for people who like Korean food!\n\nFavorites: Bulgogi with lettuce wraps and chap chae\n\nI really want to go back to try the karaoke here.
0,"Probably the worst, most over priced food I have ever had!!!!!!! Their Salad was straight out of a bag, the fries were cold and rubbery, the cowboy burger was over cooked, and the bacon was undercooked. How can this place even be in business?? I could have made a better meal with my arms cut off and my eyes gouged out. Save your money and go next door to Durant's."
4,"I love this place. My least favorite experience here involved spending 15 minutes to get from one side of the club to the next and it was still a great experience simply because New Kids on the Block were there. I've been to several events at this club (including a movie screening which was surprisingly awesome) and it's always been a fun time. The music is usually pretty good, the drunks seem pretty happy, and the bottle service was kind of amazing. I was here for a friend's birthday and I am completely spoiled now after that table experience (they might have been great simply because her face was on the flyer for that party but I like to think that they're just always that wonderful). The performers I've seen here were great and the layout is pretty rectangular and open. I love the terrace because it's great to get away from the smoke and noise every once in a while and it's a completely different atmosphere (equally fab). This is one of the ONLY clubs in town that I come to repeatedly just for the hell of it.\n\nP.S. For those of us who are morbidly curious, I asked security how many girls fall flat on their faces at the stairs per night (the answer was between four and five)."
1,"I was really disappointed with Nobu's main entree, hence this low score.  I ordered the black cod with miso because I loveeeee cod, but this cod did not taste like how it was described on the menu.  It was sweet, with overpowering sweet maple-tasting sauce, not what I thought of when I think miso soup. Anyway,  the sweetness was so overpowering I couldn't tell if I was, in fact, eating cod.  I had it packed and stored it in my hotel room's fridge because I just didn't like it.  In hindsight, I shoulda sent it back a la Gordon Ramsay style and ordered something else.  The yellowtail roll with scallion and the yellowtail with jalape\u00f1o was good. The salmon roll was ok.  Shrimp tempura was just two little pieces.  Disappointing and overhyped restaurant."
4,"A case study in great service. No more than 10 minutes after sharing our unfortunate and clearly uncommon experience, we received a call from the head of food and beverage extending their sincerest apologies.\n\nEveryone can make a mistake from time to time, but the great places make things right. In our case they made things right and then some. We've never been taken care of so well as we were by the staff and management of Prado.\n\nThank you for an even more memorable evening than we were expecting!"
1,"The restaurant has a nice appearance but the food was disappointing.\n\nWe got what looked like a heaping amount of guacamole, but in the middle of it they put chips (hidden to the eye until you get there) which made for soggy chips and less guac.  The guac was actually pretty good but that was disappointing.\n\nI got the pulled pork sandwich for lunch.  The portions were tiny and there was absolutely no presentation.  For $15 dollars at lunch I expect more food and more presentation than I got.\n\nThe drinks here are expensive too.  I think they are all about $12 each.  We went for the pitcher of Mojito's and while it was good, it was hard to get the mojito out from all of the ice, etc.\n\nI would not eat here again, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
1,This place was good the firsr time but I just had it again and it was awful. The rice tasted like it was reheated from the day before in a dirty skillet. The noodles were burnt and my sweet and sour shrimp tasted like it was fried about 3 times. I opened up one of the shrimp and it looked like shrimp jerky. It was horrible.  I won't be back
4,"Having eaten so many times at Le Cirque, I would say I am a bit of an expert.  I've had everything on the menu, sometimes multiple times, and I can honestly say that they do not serve even a single bad dish.  This is one high-class restaurant that has earned their Five Diamonds.  In fact, their sister location in New York City has been the haunt of many of the cities elite.  Ever since their opening of their Las Vegas location in The Bellagio, they have been a shining star in the Las Vegas dining scene.\n\nThe fine french style cuisine is separated into two sections on the menu: Classic and Contemporary.  They have a well prepared prix fixe menu, that I would recommend for the indecisive, but I have always just chosen my own.  One thing I would leave up to the staff would be the wine pairings.  The Sommelier is very accomplished, and knows exactly how to find a perfect match between your personal tastes and the food you are eating.  For those more interested in a liquor or cocktail pairing the Bartender is as seasoned and artful as they come.  \n\nHere are my suggestions for the Appetizer and the Entree, both for the Classic and the Contemporary\n\nAppetizer, Classic:  Salade de Homard\nThis lobster and fresh greens salad is in a black truffle oil dressing, and it is their signature appetizer.  It is crisp, fresh, lightly rich, and expertly well balanced.  A perfect prelude to a fine meal.\n\nAppetizer, Contemporary:  Risotto du March\u00e9\nWhile the risotto they serve changes once each season, I have yet to have one that wasn't completely decadent.  I believe one of the best I've had was the Wild Mushroom and gruy\u00e8re.\n\nEntree, Classic:  C\u0153ur de Filet de B\u0153uf\nWhen people ask me my absolute favorite food, this is what I tell them.  A large rare to medium rare tenderloin steak, saut\u00e9ed foie gras on top, with little potato croquettes and sweet onion compote.  And of course, plenty of the reduction made from the steak.  While fine dining has a stigma of not being filling, this is one large dish that I have only managed to finish once out of the several times I've ordered it.  If you plan on it, get a salad for your entree, and maybe take desert to go.\n\nEntree, Contemporary:  Magret de Canard\nThis dish of Honey Duck Magret uses the natural richness and flavor of the duck to play with the sweet flavors of the Black Mission Fig, Apricot, Daikon Radish, and Cassis Coulis.  This is something that I would not only be surprised to see on Iron Chef America or Top Chef Masters, but even impressed.\n\nWith whatever dessert you find most fitting, they also serve a tray several small bites such as a mini-raspberry tart, dark chocolate covered almond slivers, and tiny meringues.  And finally to go, they give each party a tiny chest of drawers, with a chocolate truffle to remind you of your experience.\n\nAnd believe me, if it is your first time or your thirtieth, you will always be thinking and wishing for the next time you will go."
2,"To start on a positive note, the staff was extremely helpful working around my food allergies and were extremely nice. They were attentive without being stuffy. The bartender picked a great wine for my mom and I to drink and was great all around. Dinner was mediocre (I got the turkey burger and sweet potato fries, she got the salmon dish). The burger was flavorful but her dish was on the small size for the price and was just fair. \n\nDinner gets 3-stars because although dinner was ok, dessert was bad. I ordered a s'more type sundae which was described as homemade graham crackers, marshmallow, and then toffee ice cream and bananas with butterscotch. The graham cracker was hard as a rock and the ice cream had MAJOR freezer burn. I love my desserts so if that is messed up it ruins a meal for me. \n\nI wouldn't come back again and I wouldn't recommend it, the staff was just too nice for me to say it while I was there."
2,Great bar atmosphere with Chinese food! Good waitress but needed help with our large group! Food Ok!  Lots of beer selections!
3,"I've been going to hot n juicy for a couple years now. I go monthly to twice a month. I was a little biased, but the staff at Boiling Crab won me over.\n\nYou basically order your seafood of choice, pick a sauce, then pick a heat level.\n\n\nI like how they have their own cups and bags for to go food. It's a nice touch.\n\nWe had a server, Shelly, who was delightful. She pretty much waited on our party of about 7 alone. She checked on us frequently, refilled our drinks often, and we never had to look for her.\n\nThe food was good. I got a lb of shrimp in the whole she-bang. This is their three sauces mixed together. It was good over all but I thought it lacked in citrus flavor. I'll definitely get lemon pepper next time as a squirt of lime really made the sauce taster for my pallet. \n\nI also had some calamari, sweet potato fries, lemon pepper fries, and Cajun fries. It was a cool option to choose spice level on the Cajun fries. I also took some gumbo the go which was delicious.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my first time at boiling crab. Would I return? Yes. The staff I encountered all seemed happy,  our server did a great job, and my food was comparable to hot n juicy."
2,"Typical cafe in the casinos. I came here with my parents for lunch and ordered:\n\n-Caesar Chicken Wrap (ok, not exceptional)\n-NY Steak and Eggs w/ Rye toast (wanted medium-rare, but came out medium-well)\n-Chinese Chicken Salad (Got the ingrediens, but didn't taste as good as elsewhere)\n-Buffalo Wings (Too Salty)\n-Coffee (bad)\n\nCheck came out to be about $71.\n\nWait time: 40 min. Waiting was too ridiculously long!\n\nThere's a Pho right next to this place which is better but not 24hr."
1,the food was good. beans are delicious. however portions are too small (compared to black bear where I usually do breakfast)the service was ok.
3,"I really liked it. Loved the cupcake variety. Food was fresh, kept hot, pleasant experience. There will be lines no matter what time you go. Staff is polite and attentive. Went here on a groupon- good wine and beer choices."
4,"I have been practicing at Northwest Yoga for just over a year and I absolutely love it!  The environment at the studio is so safe, loving, and welcoming.  The teachers are excellent and give a physical workout as well as a spiritual experience.  Northwest Yoga is a wonderful community that is unpretentious and where you quickly become family.  So glad I found it!"
4,"Oh. My. Chocolishisness. \n\nThese are ridiculously flavorful (no guessing... you'll know which is which) and uniquely textured... I would certainly NOT wait for Valentine's Day. It deserves all five stars, while definitely a luxury, totally worth it for chocolate lovers (or for any level of chocolate appreciaters)."
4,Great place for Italian food. Very family friendly. Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Never had a bad meal. My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge. Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price.
2,It's convenient if you're staying at Gold Coast Hotel....they have cheap & good dimsum in there!  \n\nThe only downside...service is slow if you're gonna order from the menu or waiting for your check...server takes a while before you can get there attention.
3,I was in the mood for breakfast and stopped in.\nI was not disappointed.\nI was seated immediately and was able to promptly place my order.\nEverything came out hot and tasty.
2,"I was hesitant to hit up Carly's for dinner last night because of the mixed reviews that were written previously, but we were in a time crunch and wanted to grab a quick bite before heading over to the Phoenix Neutrino Project.  I was with my BF; we were downtown and it looked like it wasn't too crowded, so we parked and went inside.\n\nThis place has character!  It reminded us a bit of the original Pita Jungle in Tempe... artwork on the walls and a hipster crowd.  Lots of healthy options on the menu and a nice selection of beer as well.  We both ordered the vegetarian wrap sandwich.  It comes with your choice of orzo or chips.  I read 'Terra Chips' somewhere on the menu, and since I love Terra Chips, I went with the chips.  Jared went with the orzo salad.  Our service was quick and attentive, and we both enjoyed our sandwiches... not quite as good as Pita Jungle, but pretty good.  I was disappointed that the 'chips' my sandwich came with were just plain potato chips, not Terra Chips.  Jared seemed to enjoy his orzo salad.\n\nWe were in and out in less than an hour, and we were satisfied with our light dinner.  I would go back to Carly's but I'd like to explore some of the other downtown local bars and restaurants before I do so."
1,"Hakkasan tries to compete with the big two clubs in Vegas right now. Marquee and XS. In a way, it does, but in another way, it's your typical Vegas club just magnified 10x.\n\nWhile it didn't have as many stairs as Marquee, there were still quite a few. Granted, there were a bunch of rooms playing any type of music you wanted and I guess you can't be taking the elevator all day with those many people.\n\nSuffice to say, it's layout isn't as good as XS which has that gigantic open area with no stairs. On the flipside, XS can get packed enough where you have to wade through the pool just to get out.\n\nBoth a downside and upside of Hakkasan is they don't close off the main dancefloor. Marquee and XS will have security shooing you away. Hakkasan did not the day I went. However, while you can make your way to the floor, you're packed like sardines.\n\nAlso, $100 for Calvin Harris? C'mon. Really? I've paid less for Kaskade and Avicii in Vegas."
4,"Latta Park really floods when it rains but that aside, it's a cozy little park with nice walking paths, both paved and unpaved. It also has a basketball court and a kiddy playground.  There are trees and wildlife galore (birds and stuff) and tons of people walking their dogs, joggers and bikers passing through. \n\nJust watch out for cankerworm season.  All those odd strings suddenly hanging down from tree branches with the grubby little green guys on the ground?  Yep, that's them...  Gross!  Make sure to get your trees banded if there's a breakout in your area."
3,I have been to The Bagel Cafe quite a few times. I've been there for breakfast and dinner. But mostly I go there to pick up a bagel and cream cheese. My favorite is the jalape\u00f1o cheddar bagel with jalape\u00f1o cheddar cream cheese. I usually get that and then one other bagel cream cheese combo and split them with my wife. I really like their bagels and they have a very good selection of homemade cream cheese. Their other food is good too.
0,It's 11:30 at night went to check into the hotel after a long 6 hour drive an was denied a hotel room because I dot have a credit card. I explained to to him I had more than enough cash an he questioned me as to why I had so much an told me he couldn't do anything WILL NEVER be staying at a comfort inn ever again
2,"not a bad place to stay. the staff is fairly helpful, but doesn't seem to like their jobs too much. i was greeted with an audible sigh upon check-in like i just interupted a thrilling game of solitaire. the room was clean and comfortable, but this IS by the airport, so bring some earplugs. the \""high speed internet\"" they advertise and offer is nothing but wireless dial-up at best. but...the price is right, and there is a cool bar/lounge next door.\n\n2/29/08 - I left some dress shirts in my room upon checkout, and when I got back to California, I called them, and they sent them out UPS at no charge!"
3,"I've gone here a few times for waxes and they've always been very thorough and far less painful than other waxing experiences I've had. This would be my go-to place, if not for their prices. The wax I get is advertised at $55 and up. I assumed mine would be $55 or $60. When I walked up to the desk to pay afterwards, my total was $75, before tip. I may have let myself go a bit but this seemed a bit high. It would have been nice to receive a little warning from the esthetician. \""Hey, I had to use extra wax to get everything so this one will cost you a bit more,\"" would have sufficed. After tip, this service ended up costing near $100. Seems a bit high for 15 minutes of their time."
3,"If you are a Duck enthusiast, go there and as well fries cooked in duck fat, best fries I ever ate."
4,"I love luv-it.  My go to sundae is the western.  Lately I have branched out a bit and tried some of their flavors of the day.  I might just be used to my sundaes but I prefer them over a flavor of the day in a cone.  It is nice they offer different flavors though.  I will still give them a try from time to time.  There is almost always a line, even in the winter but there is plenty of people watching to do to pass the time.  I do wish they were open a little earlier but when I first started going they weren't open 7 days a week like they are now so I will take what I can get.  My fave downtown lunch is Viva Arepeas then dessert at Luv-It.  So good!  Oh yeah and make sure you bring cash, if you forget there is an atm in the mini mart next door."
1,"The food was good and the service was decent.  Didn't like the fact that they charge 20% gratuity on top of your food and tax.   My $43 bill came out to be $56!\n\nI've never experienced the practice of adding gratuity on top of the tax before.  In addition, we were never told there would be an extra charge for 6 persons...\n\nEnjoy the food, take a close look at your bill...."
2,"I was very excited about playing golf here since its firmly entrenched in one of the more exclusive housing areas in Summerlin called The Ridges.  I was here for a fundraiser so we played shotgun.  \n\nThe golf course is billed as Jack Nicklaus' best holes in one round.  I can definitely see the potential but this time around, I don't think the potential was actualized.  Granted it was over 100 degrees but the course was very dry and the greens spotty.  It was definitely punched recently but wasn't healing as well as it should.\n\nChecked out the club house to see if there's anything to purchase but the guy working at the counter looked right at me then looked away.  I do not expect to be pampered but a hello would be nice.  Needless to say, I didn't buy anything.\n\nAgain, every hole has the potential to be phenomenal with great views of all the beautiful homes as well as views of he strip on a couple of holes.  Unfortunately, I think I caught it during a bad stretch.  I will be back and re-review if I find the experience to be different."
1,Food was ok but not spectacular.  Service was poor with our waitress (the other younger one seemed much nicer).  She had a poor attitude and got our order wrong.  We had the lo Mein noodle soup with chicken katsu.  And the Taiwanese pork dish.  Had asked for pork katsu with udon but we were hungry so stuck with it.
2,"Viva Mexican Food in Vegas?  This little joint a few miles off the Strip is worthy of consideration.   Two standouts here are the chile relleno and fideo soup, which my buddy Dan says is tough to find in many LA Mexican eateries.  However, the rest of the menu is about as exciting as a trip to El Torito.  Decent food and good service for the price."
2,My friends and I had been wondering why any place in the center of a strip mall would be called Crusin 4 anything so I was happy that once I walked into Cruisin 4 Yogurt and understood the name.  The auto shop theme is a different spin on things and I like the containers that the toppings are in.  I am glad that there is a frozen yogurt shop in Surprise but to be honest the yogurt is just ok.
0,"Is there LESS than one star??   \n\nI used to recommend Ellis Island ribs to EVERYONE coming to Las Vegas, but no more.  You guys absolutely suck.  \n\nWe went in with an 11 year old and her dad, the first time in Vegas for both of them, and the FIRST night in town I took them to ELLIS ISLAND.   \n\nAfter an hour wait for a table, we left with an 11 year old in tears because they don't serve DINNER to anyone under 21, even with outdoor seating, and they don't offer take-out either.  No way for me to pull THAT one out of the bag.  We went to Margeritaville instead.\n\nWay to ruin a vacation, guys.  It just wasn't that much to ask.  \n\nI'm a local, and I won't be back, and I'll tell anyone that will listen that Ellis Island is NOT the place to go."
4,"I've been ordering from Vitacost from quite a while and have not had a problem except once. I started a new diet and exercise routine and my eating has to be pretty strict in the beginning. I'm taking a meal replacement to get the protein I need and eating high protein, low carb meals designed by my nutritionist. I was running out of my meal replacement which is a hard to find one because it's all natural, high protein, low carb, tastes great and no artificial flavors. \n\nAlso it has superior quality protein. So anyway, let me preface this by saying I HATE chocolate anything. Hate is probably even an understatement. I just cannot eat or drink anything chocolate flavored. So I always order vanilla meal replacement. Well I opened my shipment from Vitacost yesterday and what was in the box instead of the vanilla that I ordered? You guessed it.....chocolate. I gag. I gag. I called and they sent a replacement so I'm awaiting the correct flavor. \n\nI order all of the time and this was the first time I received an incorrect order. The customer service agent was very helpful. Now I will just wait for the right flavor to arrive. The prices are really great, much better than Vitamin Shoppe. Vitamin who? Right! Team Vitacost all the way.\n\nI've placed close to 200 orders over the last few years to Vitacost, so one wrong order out of 200 deserves 5 stars.  They have the best prices and best service. I highly recommend."
4,"This has got to be the foodie deal of the century!\n\nMultiple options for the tasting menu, all way under $100, with wine pairing options under $50, for dishes that approach the level of, if not quite reaching, French laundry. On top of that, all the additional amuse bouches was like having two other tasting courses. I literally counted that we had 12 amuse bouches...yes, 12! And really good ones! True, most of them were truly half a bite sized, but if they were any larger, I really would have exploded. They even gave me a glass of sparkling wine to pair with an amuse bouche...I mean, who does that??\n\nTo start, the atmosphere of the restaurant is old school, and initially a bit stuffy...but the waitstaff were all extremely pleasant (as should be for this level restaurant). Throughout the meal, they do their best to be invisible, but the space is a bit small so I couldn't help noticing now and then someone intently watching us as we were finishing a plate so that they could clear it away. Having said that, there was one time that my husband got up to go to the restroom, I looked down for one second, and when I looked back a freshly tied napkin was in the place of the dirty plate that had been there. That's stealth. You can see Mr. Binkley at the service window the entire time, so you know that every dish is getting checked by him before going out...which is always gratifying to see. \n\nIf you're a bacon lover, or even if you're not but are ok with bacon, you have to try the applewood smoke bacon bourbon drink. It's amazing, and a great way to start off the evening. They serve it with a single large ice cube that fills the glass with applewood scented smoke (you can really smell it), and the bourbon really had a nice subtle smoky bacon flavor. They serve it with a garnish of sugar coated bacon on the side, which I could have done without, or would have enjoyed more if they had cut down on the sugar. It was like trying to eat a block of sugar with the bacon trapped way inside...perhaps I was supposed to stir it in the drink? Oh well, I still enjoyed it immensely. \n\nWe each chose the 5 course tasting menu that included both a meat and fish, and excluded the cheese plate. However, before our first dish, we were given an onslaught of 4 amuse bouches! A small cup of curried pear soup, a complex plate of duck pate with toast, a spoonful of chilled granita like fruit, and a miniature (I mean really mini, the size of a quarter) sloppy joe. After that, they slowed down to 1 to 2 amuse bouches between each plate. They really like to plate to dramatic effect, but it makes the whole experience more fun.\n\nI'm not going to go into any detail about our courses since the menu changes daily, but I thought every plate was spot on. Each dish is intricately plated and though some look like works of art, others aren't quite as pretty, but still taste fantastic. There are so many ingredients to each dish, that occasionally it's a little confusing as to what might be the best way to eat it, but I often just shovel everything into my mouth, and all the flavors would complement each other. The seafood was delicate, the meats were perfectly cooked in bite size portions (the mangalitsa pork was served 3 ways on the plate). All the dollops of sauces and garnishes were flavor packed. The desserts were lovely and not too heavy. \n\nI was pretty smashed by the end of the night, after 6 glasses of wine, but I still remember most of the evening! Having recently moved from the Bay area, and eating at some of the highly rated restaurants there, including French Laundry, this really is just as good at half the price. I will definitely be making many an excuse to eat there again. It's definitely taken away a little of the sting of having to leave San Francisco."
3,Went here for my birthday with about 12 people and we enjoyed out first experience at Grimaldi's. We had about 4-5 large pizzas and had a lil leftover to take home but boy was that the best pizza I have ever had!! A lil bit hard to find but this is my new favorite pizza place! :)
4,Very clean and comfortable poker room. The best in Vegas! Be sure to order the cappuccino with the swizzle stick sugar.. sooo good. Also they have all kinds of delicious drinks here :)
0,"This review is for the poor service. It was so bad, we walked out before our main food ever came. It took 25 minutes to order food and after 1 1/2 hours, we asked if our food is on the way. The waiter made excuses saying he doesn't usually work with these cooks today and that they have their own thing going on back there...blah blah blah...basically, he didn't want us to blame him for the bad service. But, they're a team and he should've be on top of it. We walked out after sitting there for two hours and empty drinks that haven't been checked on for 30 minutes. This place needs to be on the RESTAURANT IMPOSSIBLE SHOW. We will never eat here again and strongly suggest anyone shouldn't either. There are way better Mexican restaurants in town that have authentic food with better prices. If you're looking for authenticity and good service, you should go elsewhere. This place is reeks americanized Mexican food and clueless waiters. Don't disappoint yourself by going here."
4,"I was first introduced to Green through a friend who had her birthday dinner catered by Green and later visited the Scottsdale Road location.  This was over 2 years ago.  Soon after, I learned that Green was opening a location just down the street from my home in Phoenix.  This is by far one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  I have yet to try everything on the menu.  The service is always friendly, the drinks are always refreshing and the bathrooms are always clean.  If you Like Green on Facebook, you can stay up to date with the specials that Green has to offer and at which location."
1,"Don't come here before 10 pm on a Friday night unless you want to listen to old ladies singing oldies songs. We were a fun group that stopped in at 8:30ish to listen to some karaoke, and it was a disaster. A bunch of blue hairs reliving their glory days and terrorizing the ears of everyone in the restaurant. I'll come back here when I'm 60. The service was also pretty bad, I remember looking back to find out server and just saw her sitting at the bar top doing nothing. On a Friday night in a bar? Really lady?"
2,"I'm extremely picky about my haircuts. These guys are really friendly and you have your neighborhood barbershop feel. \n\nBut, they're talented to a certain extent. They do great fades and line ups, but I was looking for a comb over and they didn't even attempt to use scissors. The top was barely touched, leaving an uneven hairdo. \n\n3 stars because they do good work, but it isn't personally my style. I probably won't be back. \n\nBring cash."
4,"I've officially had the pizza now.\nI have to say that it is actually some of the BEST pizza I have ever had in my entire life. \nI actually woke up this morning craving it. The crust is super fantastic. \nI am really boring when it comes to pizza; this meaning that I either only eat plain cheese or I will get a pizza with one item on it. \n\nSomeone once told me that getting plain cheese pizza is the best way to judge whether or not a place actually has good pizza. If you load it up with all that junk you can't taste whether the sauce is flavorful or the crust is good. I am here to say that Mellow Mushroom is the real deal. Their pizza is great even without all of the toppings.\n\nI have heard that the specialty pizzas are phenomenal, so despite my normal behavior, I will have to try at least a few of them.\n\nMellow Mushroom, I will return for your tasty pies."
2,"No free internet access, what is this, the times of Charlemagne??? $14/day to get internet access (something that EVERY hotel/motel should have INCLUDED, GRATIS) at this place, absurd considering how much money you're already paying to stay here!\n\nOtherwise the place was pretty good but could use just a little bit better upkeep, though I think overall they manage pretty well.\n\nPros:\n- Had a pretty spacious room for two, only stayed three nights so were traveling relatively light. King sized bed was nice.\n- Great modern thermostatic A/C system in the room with plenty of controls. Could adjust the climate in there to my liking pretty quickly.\n- Great maid service -- they cleaned up the room well every day, kept the fresh towels coming, even understood a \""message\"" I had left them: one of the two bathroom light bulbs was burnt out, so I took it out and left it on the counter and was pleasantly surprised when I returned later to find a new bulb!\n- Great location -- right in the middle of everything.\n- Cheaper than a lot of other places, though not the cheapest.\n- Resort itself was pretty nice with the pool, spa, stores, etc. Built-in convenience store open 24/7.\n\nCons:\n- No free internet access. WTF.\n- Carpet had some large weird ring stain on it, not sure what it was about.\n- Only had two power outlets available to use, none by the bed. Was a little bit inconvenient considering we had a bunch of stuff to plug in.\n- No fridge to keep left-overs or coffee maker for coffee or tea.\n- Old CRT TV, though admittedly I didn't come here for TV and only watched some briefly one night to help fall asleep.\n- Bathroom didn't have a usable tub, just a shower.\n- The provided hand soap was AWFUL. It made my hands feel so dry! I work on cars as a hobby and I tell you my hands feel better after Fast Orange than with whatever that bar of soap was.. How about some liquid hand soap???\n- Included breakfast would have been nice.\n- Was promised a good coupon book as part of the itinerary and whole package we paid for but they said they ran out of them... No attempts were made to appease our disappointment and their breach of promise.\n\nI guess if you're going to Vegas, you have to expect to be nickel and dimed ..."
3,"Great instructors, spacious well equipped gym. My 4 yr old daughter attends weekly in the firecrackers class. I love that they have many different class times to choose from. They offer gymnastics classes for every age and experience level, cheerleading, adult gym time, parties, and different camps throughout the year. I'm so glad I found this place for my daughter, she absolutely loves coming here!"
0,"In my 20 years of bar going, I have NEVER been  gouged before...... before tonight.  I'm not going to drone on and on.  Plain and simple. I had 4 beers and was charged for 6.  When it was brought up, they very gladly removed 2...  but, this was also on Monday (supposedly $5 Smirnoff martini night).   I ordered 2 Lemon Drop martinis at different times, and was charged $12 for Ketel 1 Martinis??  Ummm, either A) tell me you're going to pour Ketel, or honor your Monday night special.  Very disappointed.  I  guess be specific or get taken advantage of... shame on me for trusting.\n\nhttp://blissonfourth.com/specials/"
4,The flowers were beautiful - just as displayed on their website - and they were able to fulfill a same day request.
2,Decent place but the overly loud and neurotic redhead manager/waitress lady is nerve racking!!!\n\nIf you go here to relax with a nice meal and a drink she will kill it. Her loud voice and constant complaining is like nails on a chalkboard
2,"Solid 3 star red curry tofu.\n\nNot 5 star, not 4 star...but hey!  They did great with the one classic dish I ordered..."
2,Giddy Up!\n\nThe have a mechanical  bull!   Wait...  They have a MECHANICAL BULL!   \n\nI really enjoy watching drunk people on mechanical bulls - you just cannot pay enough for this comedy.\n\nThis a country bar / bbq place with limited seating (this particular evening).   They have a large dance floor where all the ladies get their line dancing in.    The wait staff wear bikinis and chaps - it is pretty hot (male perspective).\n\nThe beer is cheap (about $3 / per domestic).   I enjoyed the evening but had to move on to the next stop.\n\nGive it a shot if you want cheap beer and get some line dancing in.   It is one stop of many on the strip :-)
4,"Wow. Friggin WoW.\nI just went last weekend during Labor Day Weekend & it was the best investment when wanting to get away from Nevada trash.\nCirque du Soleil shows, in general, are brilliant but the Beatles Love show is superb! It was a concert, a blast into history slash acrobatic act.\n\nIt tells a story by going through all their songs and the stage set up is amazing! I would recommend this to anyone. Not to mention every seat in the house is a good seat. Its very intimate!"
1,"I went in here and was slightly disappointed.  I was so looking forward to eating Peruvian food too!\n\nSo as soon as my husband and I walk in, I noticed the hostess just looked at us.  She didn't really greet us at all.  My husband and I just stood awkwardly for a minute and I just tried to look interested in the desserts on display.  That did give me time to give googly eyes to the tres leches in the \""I will have my way with you\"" look.  So at least the awkward waiting wasn't for nothing.  I did have to look at the hostess and finally ask if it was alright to sit in the booth that was close to us, to which she did promptly bring us menus.  To me, at least give me a smile when I walk into your restaurant and acknowledge me.  That'd be nice.\n\nThe place was decorated nicely, though it was a little cold in there, but I was also sitting in the booth closest to the doors.  The environment isn't something fancy, but it is an alright place for a chill meal.\n\nThe food was a little disappointing compared to the location in Pineville.  I had ordered the chicken salad avocado and it was really salty.  I was trying to make sure I always had a bit of avocado with the chicken since it was very very salty.  I had also ordered the meat platter that provided a big variety.  It was a big portion, so that was very good.  I think that it could even be shared between four people and you'd still be full.  There wasn't very anything exciting to me about that meat platter.\n\nThe service was alright.  The hostess kind of started the night off badly for me in my opinion.  I noticed that nobody ever came to check on us.  I know the restaurant is small, but people can still stop by our table just to see how everything is.  We had to eye a waitress down and request a box after we stopped touching our food after 5-7 minutes.  \n\nI think the only good thing about this place was the tres leches.  I definitely was not disappointed with that.  If I ever find myself at this location again, I think the only thing that I would expect to be super delicious is the tres leches.  *sigh*"
0,"Food is good, but customer service should be just as good. Very rude, not friendly makes you feel un welcome. Don't know how he stays in business. Will tell all people I know to never go there. Vegas is full of good markets and this is not one of them."
3,"I just went to this place for the first time today.  I was told they now have a different owner, and from what I hear that is a very good thing!  I really enjoyed the chi-style dogs here.  Originally from Chicago I was very disappointed to find nothing but garbage places out here for dogs, but this place was very good.  All vienna beef with that awsome snap!  and the polish was excellent.  I don't know how it was before but I can say now, this place is very good and so far its the best I have found out here that reminds me of home."
1,"Young guy with shaggy hair this morning was very friendly, efficient, and moved us in and out quickly. Upon returning this afternoon around 3, we walked into a line that was already 3 people deep and at least 2-3 more filtered in behind us. After waiting almost 45 minutes in line, we found out there were only 2 men working and only 1 of them had access to the computer. When we told the man at the desk that our battery died on us, he just sort of grunted at us and we had to ask for any sort of compensation for the inconvenience of jumping it. In the end, he took off about 2 bucks. The man, Del, moved very slowly and showed no emotion or interest in how the customers were feeling. I've worked in retail for 5 years, and I get that being understaffed is no fun, but its all in how you handle it. Del did not handle it well and his partner seemed very frustrated that he couldn't help more. We came back to this site after a good experience last year, but may not come back again. After a day of moving, the last thing any customer needs is to stand in a long, slow line with a grumpy worker."
1,After 3 attempts I think im through with this place. First time chow mein was burned. Second the food tasted like it sat around for a long time and the third it just wasnt anything special. I am not sure if this is because they are not in that great of a location. This wasnt my first experience with Panda express. I have enjoyd their food at other locations just fine.
3,"Had dinner here with my wife, mother, and 9mo old this weekend.  We were the only customers and did not have the problems with service that others have reported.  The food was more \""traditional\"" than we're used to - still delicious.  We had the assorted appetizer platter and 3 meals off the yellow \""specials\"" menu - with one mango lassi, the bill came to $43 with tax.\n\nNote that they don't serve any alcohol, but said we could buy anything we wanted from the grocery next door and drink it with dinner.  So we grabbed a couple of beers.  \n\nWe were cracking up at the background music + TV - when we arrived they were showing the Indian \""Who Wants to be a Millionaire\"", and switched to music videos by the time we left.  Quite entertaining."
0,"An example of one of their stupid idiotic \""rules\"" is this. At the gate next to us, a flight for Al Paso was posted to leave at 6:50 but it was delayed for 1 hour. A couple left to get some food and arrived back in about 20 minutes ... but their plane had left. The rule is that even if we post a delay your flight might leave R Amy time without you .... So, if the airline is late they can fool you I to leaving and then take off without you WTH again?"
0,"Probably the WORST sushi restaurant we have EVER been to. The sushi was warm, looked old. The California roll was obviously not made to order and was thinner than a quarter. I ordered a glass of $9 white wine and was given a VERY small pour.The atmosphere was every uninviting at best. The table was sticky and the candles on the table were battery operated but none of them worked. The music was horrible....they were playing tacky techno.....why? If I wanted to watch sports I would go right next door instead of being forced to watch it on every TV they had. Oh, and it was so HOt inside that we were actually sweating! I left the restaurant disappointed and mad that I wasted the $50 especially these days, when times are tough and eating out is a rare event. SAVE YOUR MONEY EVERYONE. This place is horrible."
0,"Imagine those restaurants that you went to when you were a kid with your family.  Where you were forced to be dressed up and try to act like an adult.  Because the grandparents decided the restaurant, it probably had its hay day about 40 years ago and hasnt changed a thing since.  They still remember it as having great food and a wonderful atmosphere.  \nThese are the memories I get at Bravo Franco and I didnt even grow up in Pittsburgh.  Unfortunately, the hay day of Bravo Franco seemed to have passed, if it was ever there, a long time ago.  \nThe service was decent which is its lone bright point.  The food just wasnt very tasty.  The Snapper special was swimming.  The veal looked tough.  The Cappucino was watery.  Trying to find a bright spot on this one."
2,Great location. Okay food. Kinda overpriced.
0,"I'm not one to judge pub food, because I don't eat it often. However, I am more than displeased with the food I ate at Burgundy Lion. I lie crouched in my bed right now suffering from a stomach ache, which was not there before I ate at B.L. It's sad, because I was really looking forward to eating at this place with friends; but between the lousy service and day old meal, I was ready to leave. The servers accidentally elbowed me in the head too many times; they forgot to put the order in for brussel sprouts and bacon, so I waited more than an hour for my meal; the fries were stale, the gravy was rancid, the codfish cakes tasted as if they were frozen like they thawed them in the deep fryer, and I think the sausage role is the reason why I'm in this state. The only thing worth getting is the house beer and don't get me started on how dry the Angus burger is. I was with a friend who is a burger fanatic and she was not touching that thing! The worst part is that you're paying so much for a meal that you didn't even enjoy. I've had meals at five star restaurants in Spain that were cheaper than this joint. Overall, this place is overrated and overpriced! Go at your own risk!"
1,"For the record, I have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly 3 years ago. I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \""yes, it's got lemon in it.\"" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\"" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \n\nAlso, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there."
2,"We tried this place for dinner last night (take out).  It was good, not great - I would eat there again when I needed easy takeout.   I ordered manicotti and thought the meatball that came with it was very good and I think next time I would try a meatball sandwich.   I love it when a restaurant has good rolls or bread to go along with your meal and I didn't care for the rolls (bread was tastless and too much seasoning on top).\n\nPrices were good and portions were reasonable sized instead of all those ridiculously large portions you get at some restaurants."
1,"I couldn't see what people are raving about this place? Oh I take it back. Perhaps it's the crazy portion of the banana split? Or the fudge sundae. Otherwise, it would just be a regular diner's style treats. We waited too long for a table and didn't have any good memory of it. 1 star goes for the cool venue in Caesars Palace, and the other star goes to the cool looking menu."
2,"I think the mac and cheese is their best dish.  Get it with the bologna.  Good comfort food.  Their cheese plate looked good and their onion rings are great if you like heaps of the thin cut type (which I do).  \n\nThe perch is my favorite of the fish selections.  I had that tonight while there.  Ordered a bowl of the beer cheese soup, too.  Somewhat flavorless and they garnished it with popcorn.  Bleh.\n\nThe rest of the menu is passable.  They try too hard for down-home Wisconsin cooking.  Whatever that is."
1,"Very disappointing! Service was very slow, food was over priced and not to order. I ordered a baked potato 'fully loaded', once the meal got there, I asked about the bacon and was told that was another $.50. I passed.\n\nI filled out their comment card and am currently waiting their response...... (crickets).\n\nNot worth the price to eat there. We may go back for the band and drinks. \n\nNeed a real Steak House in the San Tan Valley!!"
4,"This reveiw is only for the pizza thats what I ate. I loved it. The sauce was damn near perfect not to sweet not to acidic, the dough was fresh and cooked right not chewy and not a cracker eithier. Service was good ambiance was cool it was a cool place to eat . Location is perfect easy to park . I actually ate here twice once sit in and had a pizza second time was just for a slice. The pizza I had was the new yorker the slice I had was a pepperoni the slice was huge it was a little pricey but no where neer the 100 i dumped  on a slot machine around the corner and the machine didnt feed me. I would eat here again. Im from north new jersey and live in the bay area now I know what good pizza is. This place is worth a try"
4,"One flat white with two raw sugars, please!\n\nLove this European-style coffee spot so much. The coffee is amazing, the snacks are so fresh (not like most stale baked goods usually served at caf\u00e9s), the vibe is perfect for hanging out solo or meeting a few friends... Oh, and dog-friendly outside! \n\nThis place is fantastic, and I think people are starting to catch on. Hands down, favorite hangout spot in Vegas."
2,"My friends and I have had a chance to eat through the entire menu. If 3.5 stars were available, I'd surely award that many to Bootleggers. \n\nBootleggers would have done a heckuva lot better had they NOT included some rather large chunks of fat in their pulled pork servings. On the other hand, their brisket presents well, nice smoke ring and good bark on the outside. I'm still confused by the warm tortillas served with the pulled pork. That said, both these meats are somewhat bland with no sauce offered to flavor things up \n\nThe Bacon Board is a nice hook and a pleasant appetizer. But, the REAL reason to eat at Bootleggers is their St Louis-style ribs. Succulent, moist and meat-falling-off-the-bone good, these ribs present well with a discernible smoke ring and real nice rub. They compete favorably with Bobby-Q and Pork On A Fork. The Apple Pie Moonshine deserves an honorable mention.\n\nThe service for our visits was excellent and the prices were reasonable."
4,"The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant"
1,"I have only had the pizza here.  Did not impress me, just fair to average pizza.  I have no plans to try it again."
4,Renovated and gorgeous. Plus arriving here is just the best feeling in the whole world. Just writing this review makes me ready to party
2,"I live within 10 minutes walking time of this place and finally made it in there today with some friends after a brown bag @gangplank.\n\nI got the veggie pies as they were the only thing vegetarian,but they were delicious. its easy to miss this place but worth finding and trying."
4,I live 1 hour away from this place i gladly drive 1 hour for an 8$ thread. Because it is so worth it. Reeta does it perfect! !  \nI have never gotten a better brow job than here.
3,"This is one of my favorite movie theaters in the Charlotte area, despite my lack of enthusiasm for shopping malls.  I normally attend movies in the late afternoons or evenings during the week and I don't purchase snacks or drinks; however, I'm super appreciative of this theater being clean and easy to locate within the mall (down at the end, across from Forever 21).  The movie schedules are great and I have even seen a few movies here that most other theaters do not show.  (For example, Dallas Buyers Club.)  There are electronic ticket kiosks if you don't want to wait in line for a ticket and I've always been a fan of the lighting near the entrance of the theater.  It doesn't really feel like you're in the middle of an outlet mall.  (Thank goodness.)  I'd give this theater five stars if the seats reclined.  :-)"
0,"Maybe I went on a bad day or I'm being overly critical, but the service was horrible. The pho was also horrible. \n\nPho is pho. The noodles, meat and vegetables are the same everywhere you go. The only way you tell if the pho is good is through the broth. The pho here was translucent and tasteless even with all the MSG they put in there to mask their laziness. \n\nBut yeah, sure. If you're an elderly white couple, then they will scream hello and thank you. I guess that means good service."
3,Good stuff.  Haven't had too much of the food.  Onion rings are delicious.  All beers delicious.  Good joint to grab a growler for the drive home...I mean for when you get home.
4,"I don't know why Little Asia only has three stars. I love the food here, way better than the 0-star Lulu's Noodles. Little Asia serve both great fake and authentic Asian food. All their dishes are under $10.00. My favorite ones are (can't post in Chinese for some reason) jiao yan xia, shui zhu niu rou, fu qi fei pian, and hong you yu pian. For the price, Little Asia probably serve the best authentic Chinese food in Pittsburgh. Rose Tea tends to be too saucy or salty for me, but Little Asia cooks the food just right. The waitress here are super nice and sweet. The interior is a little weird after they moved. But other than that, I have no complaints. I would pick Little Asia over Lulu's Noodles or Oriental Express anytime. \n\nAlso if you like ice cream, they serve mochi ice cream, which is outrageously delicious."
4,"Any parent with young children can vouch for me on this one...keeping the attention of a three year old is, to say the least, difficult. They need constant stimulation, otherwise, there very well may be hell to pay!\n\nEnter, the Children's Museum of Phoenix!\n\nThe facility is an old school, converted into three stories of pure fun and energy! \n\nAfter you pay your standard $11/person older than 1 (or your $22 for up to four people with a Groupon), you encounter a three story art project that can only be described as AWESOME! There are multiple ways in which your children can traverse this mammoth. The various pathways challenge children in strength, balance, and critical thinking skills...all of the ways you want to challenge your child!\n\nAfter your child has lost interest in this room, you progress to the second floor. Here, children get to experiment with a really cool board that can only be described as \""Plinko-esque\"". Here, children can alter the path of a falling object by changing different platforms. My daughter thought I was a genius because I was able to predict where her object would land every time...it's a shame she'll ultimately realize how routine that feat really is.  \n\nAfter Plinko, children can either go to the trike wash, build forts, or they can head to the art room. After some laps through the wash, my daughter wanted to head into the art room. Being that we went right before Halloween, our child had the opportunity to make black play dough (to make spiders), she got to paint on a giant rocket ship, and then she was able to make a spooky tree out of a brown paper bag. Such simple activities...such great opportunities!\n\nAfter cleaning all of the paint from her smock, we made the journey up...to the third floor. Here, children get to play grown-ups. There's a mock supermarket that allows children to either shop, ring up merchandise, or work in the stock room of a miniature grocery store.\n\nAfter shopping, our daughter wanted to work at the little ice cream stand located just outside of the grocery. We had fake ice cream cones and sat at the tiny bistro set while we watched children make their way through the noodle forest. We then made our way to the end of the hall to race miniature race cars on roller skate wheels.\n\nBeing only three floors, our day at the museum only lasted a couple of hours...but in those short hours, my daughter never stopped smiling!\n\nHow on earth could you rate any place less than five stars when it brings so much joy to YOUR pride and joy?"
2,"My wife booked us rooms at the MGM Grand because they where advertising the latest, most up to date rooms. I would rather have stayed someplace that had a better atmosphere. \n\nThis was my first time in Vegas. We went to Vegas for a combined celebration of my wife's birthday and a belated Honeymoon. When we arrived, the girl checking us in said she could give us an upgrade in the room, but the room we had reserved had all the latest technology. Flat screen TV, Blu Ray, ETC.. the room she would move us into didn't have any of that. I didn't care, we took the upgrade. I didn't come to Vegas to watch TV, and to be honest I never turned it on. The room was nice enough; I didn't plan on spending a lot of time in the room, just change clothes and sleep. I will say the huge king sized bed we had was very comfortable! Plus it had free WIFI. \n\nThe shower was weird. I'm not a tall man, but I could not stand under the shower head. My wife is 5'4 and even she had issues with the height of the shower head location. It could have stood to be about a foot higher. Other than that, the bathroom was nice enough in the room. \n\nSo why the low rating? The rest of the resort. \n\nThis place is huge. After we checked in, we went to our room, unpacked, changed and went to hit the strip! We wanted to get onto Las Vegas Blvd... there where no signs or directions on how to get there. I walked around the casino, hotel, resort, going in circles when I finally found the concierge desk, I was annoyed, but I tried to make a joke of it by making fun of myself, I actually asked the concierge, \""How do I get out of this hotel?!\"" They gave me a map and directions for me to get onto Las Vegas Blvd. After that I really didn't have too many problems, I was able to find my way in and out. This was another thing I didn't like After walking down the strip, especially at the end of the night, you are relieved to get to the hotel, only to have to walk what seems like a mile through crowds to get to the elevator bank. \n\nI didn't care for the atmosphere of the casino itself. It seems so stuffy and pretentious. I don't know, maybe I've seen too many movies, but it's not at all how I pictured a casino would look in Vegas. The staff was friendly when you could find one. A lot of times they would come around and ask if we wanted drinks only for us to never see them again. Or we would be playing for long periods of time before someone would ask if wanted a drink. \n\nAnd what is with all of the kids?! There were a ton of kids there. Who the heck brings kids to Vegas? I'm sorry, it only takes about a minute of walking up and down the strip to realize Vegas isn't exactly \""family friendly\"". I'm not holding that against the hotel, it just has been bothering me. \n\nWe had pre-paid for our rooms when we booked them, and then where surprised with an $18 (we booked and paid before they raised it, so we got the price at the time we booked) a night resort fee... and then they charged tax on top of it. Sure the $80 dollars is not going to break us, but still... that is like 3 drinks on the strip! \n\nThe lion habitat was pretty neat. I did get some good pictures up close of that. I appreciated the helpfulness of the hotel staff, but honestly the next time we go to Vegas I want to stay someplace more my style."
0,"Not veggie friendly.. so I've always liked Qdoba better than Chipotle, which happens to be right next door to them, but I'll definitely go to Chipotle from now on! Normally I grab food on my way to work in the evening,  but today I stopped in around 3pm..what a difference. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and get this they charge for an extra scoop of lettuce! This extra charge is not listed on the menu and it's a vegetarian burrito, what else would you put in it? Chipotle has tofu, Qdoba does not. I did not get the grilled veggies on it because they are always salty and normally I just get a lot of lettuce on it beside the rice and beans. Now it is not like I wanted a bowl of lettuce just 1 extra scoop and yes there is a charge for that. I have never been  charged extra at any other Qdoba nor at this store in the evening for lettuce. What made it even more surprising is this extra charge is not listed on the menu.  So when asked for a customer service number to file a complaint she kept insisting I call the survey number on my receipt to speak to a live person....total lie no live person just a recording so I ask her for a store manager or a districts manager 's name and she claims there isn't one that they are between district managers..Finally I gave up and searched online,  found a customer service number where an actual personal answered, got a store and a district manager's name and a promise of a return call. Being charged extra for something  like lettuce bothers me, but being lied to is unacceptable.  I could've dealt with just filing a complaint about the lettuce charge and went on with my day, but being lied to is terrible customer service. Next time I will just go to Chipotle where they don't charge for lettuce and the employees are nicer."
0,"Oh dear.\n\nMelville Castle has been a hotel and private function venue for many years, only just opening to the public as a bar/restaurant last month (November 2013) We went one Saturday, previous to a midweek Birthday celebration, to see what it was like. Alarm bells were already ringing  as we left after this brief visit. We went on the first day of service and were told upon trying to order drinks that one of only two lagers on tap were off. Before even receiving our drinks the manager came to take our food order. We were only there for bar snacks, for which the menu had not yet been prepared. The manager recited the bar menu from memory and we ordered chicken breast nachos and chips.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later our (incorrect) drinks order arrived. After being left for roughly 40 minutes in an empty restaurant, our food eventually arrived. This is when the wait became self evident. The nachos were an obviously hastily assembled plate of nacho chips, topped with, instead of the advertised salsa, sweet chilli dressing (me neither) and cold grated cheddar, despite the plate being piping hot. There is a Tesco 5 minutes down the road, go figure. The chips were served hot yet still raw in the middle. Asking for the bill we had to wait a further 10-15 minutes for the bar staff to calculate the cost on a calculator in the absence of a working till.\n\nStupidly, despite this, we gave them the benefit of the doubt. It was opening night, places have hiccups, these things happen. And continued to happen, in our case.\n\nWe returned four days later for our Birthday celebration. The Birthday guest was Vegan. With such a strict dietary requirement we always give plenty notice and forewarning. Being told that this was no problem and would be noted alongside our booking, it was disappointing to find that there had been absolutely no communication with the kitchen and the Birthday guest was offered either \""vegetables\""(?!) or beetroot risotto. Interchangeable as starter and main. \n\nWith such a dizzying array of options, she chose the indeterminable serving of \""vegetables\"" for starters and the beetroot risotto for mains. The vegetable starter was a minuscule and completely unremarkable serving of cold, oily roasted aubergine and pepper with some green leaves. It wasn't bad but there wasn't anything to get wrong. The beetroot risotto was a horrid plate of completely tasteless, lukewarm, gelatinous rice pudding, coloured with what seemed to be purple food dye and surrounded by a neon green liquid.  \n\nFor the rest of us, we ordered the soup; Leek and Potato. It was, again, unremarkable and initially served with 3 slices of burnt melba toast and then, bizarrely followed up with half a baguette five minutes later. The goats cheese ciabatta was nice enough but nothing you couldn't easily make at home. I ordered the \""Gravadlax of Wester Ross Salmon, Pickled Cucumber, Lemon, Wholemeal Bread & Dill mayo\"" (after being told that the fish mezze I had wanted was no longer available on the dinner menu after only four days of opening) which ended up consisting of a couple insultingly thin wafers of salmon served without any lemon, pickled cucumber or wholemeal bread but I did get an overly acidic \""dill mayo'\n\nMains consisted of the aforementioned flavourless and stodgy beetroot concoction. The other two diners ordered the chargrilled aubergine which also came without half of the ingredients advertised on the menu. I had the duck breast, which again, bore no resemblance to the menu description and instead of dauphinois potato, was served with a disgusting, saccharine, green coloured mash.\n\nComing to over \u00a3125 (without even being charged for the inedible risotto!) made this an unmitigated disaster of an evening. As if this was not bad enough, we received a phone call four days later from the manager to say that their 'debit merchant' was unable to take our card payment without proof of us being in the restaurant and requested secure card details over the phone!\n\nThe staff were very nice, apologetic and understanding but the rest of the experience did nothing to instil any faith in this establishment. It was like an evening spent as unwitting extras in an episode of Fawlty Towers. Farcical."
4,"Highly recommend! \nWe have white carpets and with two dogs and a nine year old son, my carpets needed some love.  My husband and I were even considering replacing the carpet. So glad I called Care-Pro first! I am unbelievably happy with their work. I have like new carpets. My gorgeous white carpets have been brought back to life. Even the dingiest most high traffic areas look brand new. \nQuality work! Friendly employees!"
2,The people here are super friendly and nice. Yhe reason I gave only three stars is one their liquid flavors was missing somethin.  I think if they remixed a few  flavors it would be a little better. And the second reason is that their liquid is pricey. Like 21 bucks for one bottle.
4,Number 36 burrito you can't go wrong.Been going there since 82 and they haven't lost a step!
0,"There's a Lee's in SF and it's pretty gross, so I don't know why I even bothered. \n\nThe place smelled like Pine Sol and vomit.\n\nThe Tofu Bahn Mi was gross. The veggies didn't seem fresh and the bread was way over toasted, so I was left with something very dry, almost powdery once bitten into. I was hungover and starving, so I tossed the bread and ate the stuff inside. Still gross.\n\nIt was my homegirl's birthday, so I hassled the kid behind the counter about giving her something and he gave her one thousand sesame balls. They were chewy, old, and missing the essential bean paste inside.\n\nI hate you, Lee."
1,"Had about as much atmosphere as a walk-in fridge, so we turned around and went to Centurion.\n\nSure the house looks nice from the outside, but inside comfort and vibe did nothing to make us want to stay."
2,"It's BBQ at an airport.  If you're in the mood for BBQ while in the airport, well friend, you have pretty darn limited options.  This place is affordable for an airport, and decent.  Great BBQ it is not, but it's serviceable, and quite a bit better than your options to the left and right.\n\nI went with the three meat platter.  The brisket was 1/2 fat; I'm pretty sure I got the end chunk.  The pulled pork was decent, and the turkey had a good smoke but was pretty dry.  They have one sauce option...yes or no.  Definitely not mustard-based, but recommended as it's not overbearing.  \n\nFor healthy sides...well, you're at a BBQ joint, so good luck with that."
3,"A fantastic little locally owned dive in South Scottsdale. I can't count how many times I've driven past George's, but I never had a desire to stop in because the strip mall it's located in is pretty shady looking. But then I read all the good reviews and decided I had to check it out. I'm glad I did. \n\nThe menu (which is posted on the wall, and takes up a lot of space) is huge. In addition to the pitas, there are pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, burgers, platters, and appetizers (both Greek and American). The very friendly girl at the counter wasn't even able to tell me what the best items were, but that's because a guy sitting just inches away started to rave about everything. I decided to go with the Original Gyro (hey, the place is call George's Famous Gyros, after all. It's $6.75 and comes with a salad or fries (I went with the salad). I also tried the Baklava since the raving customer told me it was the best he's ever had.\n\nThe Gyro was phenomenal. As good as any Gyro place I've ever eaten at. It's all from Chicago, and you can taste it! It looks small at first, but you'll be surprised at how much meat the pita is filled with. I recommend paying the extra 25 cents for extra sauce. The Gyro is so stuffed with lamb, that you'll appreciate the flavor it adds. The salad is pretty big, but it's pretty much just a standard Greek salad. The Baklava was great, but pretty small even for it's $2.25 price. I would also suggest that George's drop the salad or fries and charge a dollar or two less for the Gyro a la cart. I really didn't want either, and would've preferred to save the cash. The wait for my food also felt a little long, but its probably because most of the food was made fresh, so I can live with that. I got my money's and taste bud's worth, and then some. I'll definitely be back at George's Famous Gyros to see what else is good here."
1,"Das Palladio hat ein sch\u00f6nes Interieur. Leider ist die Bedienung viel zu langsam. Bisweilen wartet man 10 Minuten auf seine Getr\u00e4nke. Essen dauert noch l\u00e4nger und ist dann nicht mehr wirklich warm (so wie bei mir). Es wurden auch schon Getr\u00e4nkebestellungen vergessen. Ein Unding, da die Barn ch meiner Sch\u00e4tzung nur Sitzpl\u00e4tze f\u00fcr ca. 50 Personen hat und bei unserem Besuch vielleicht 30 Personen da waren.\nIch hatte ein Pizzabrot, was mir empfohlen wurde und dann noch ein bi\u00dfchen Pizza von einem Kollegen. Beides war nur Durchschnitt und keine Gaumenexplosion.\nWenn ich die Wahl habe, werde ich wohl nicht mehr wiederkommen..."
3,Their drive through is hit or miss....sometimes it's super long and other times it's crazy fast.  You just never know. \nBut the coffee is consistent and the staff is friendly.
3,I have been going to Boulders on Broadway every Thursday night with a group of friends since August. I love it. The atmosphere is really laid-back and on Thursdays many of their bottled beers are half-off. I have only eaten there a few times but each time the food was delicious. I highly recommend the steak and walnut salad as well as their home-made potato chips. Boulders is the perfect place to go if you are looking for some place low-key.
2,Not my fav place prob like #7 on my list however a great lunch spot late in the afternoon its usaully empty. I like there lettuce wrap thing o and they have alcohol there too after being in Barnes & Noble for hours I get hungry and thirsty what can I say!?!? The one in awhatukee bluuuu 100x worse food wise but thats another review =)
4,"I'm here on business so that means I'm here sans wife and kids.  This is definitely not a place we'd have looked at twice if I had the family in tow.\n\nFirstly, their sign says \""Chinese and Cuban Food\"" which usually isn't something that I'm going to even give a second glance.  Stick to one cuisine -- generally speaking when people try to dabble in different cuisines none of them are done extremely well.\n\nTruth be told I was out on a quest for Mexican food I found on yelp.  But, both restaurants closed at 7pm and I was out looking at a few minutes after 7 so this place caught my eye.\n\nI can't tell you how the cuban food tastes; but, I had something called the \""Hunan Fried Rice\"" which is house special of sorts.\n\nIt was amazing.  It had eggs and bacon in it along with quite a bit of other flavors.  A bit of a language barrier -- I asked for no mushrooms and the waitress thought I was asking for no hot sauce.  \n\nBut, they brought some on the side and just a little bit of it did the trick.  It was very very hot.\n\nPoint is I loved the place and glad I stopped in.  It was within my budget also."
0,"I found a half-foot strand of thick hair in my Pho Dac Biet. I give props to the waiter for not apologizing and keeping a smile on his face the whole time there. Also accompanied by noisy waiters, dull atmosphere, and crappy foreign music, I could not stay a second longer. If you're a tourist reading this review, let Vietnamese wait until you get home. There are better ways to spend your money in Vegas and gambling is one of them."
1,"Odd customer service model.  While there were only a few tables with customers when I came in (about three), I was given a menu from Kate who said Helen  would be my server.  Helen finally appeared from the back and took my order.  She then disappeared to the back.  Suddenly my check was on my table.  Ok, I understand this is an airport and they want to get paid before people jet. \nAgain, restaurant fairly empty, a customer who needed to pay her bill and get to her flight asked the bar tender, who was the only wait staff on the floor.  \""I can't help you.  I was not your sever.\""  Weird! Where's the teamwork?  The response should have been \""let me get your server to help you.\""  Finally her wait person appeared from the back (Helen) to settle the bill but then Helen disappeared to the back again.  The lady stood there and stood there holding some cash and her check.  She finally asked the bar tender to give it to Helen and that she can't wait any longer. \nMy burger arrived with a \""this has a wonderful smell.\""  \""Helen\"" I thought, \""get your nose out of my food.\""  My ice tea went empty.  \""I sure need a refill to wash this dry bun burger down\"" I thought to myself.  Finally when I had just one bite to go, I got a refill.  Again, with both Helen and Kate spending most of their time in the back.  I suspect they are chief cook and dishwasher as well as wait staff.  If you're sitting at a table, don't even think of asking or even looking at the bar tender.  She won't help.  \nWhat's a person to do though?  Stuck in the airport and it's the only \""restaurant\"" past security.\nLesson?  Eat before you arrive or \""fill up\"" on those crappy airline \""meals for purchase.\"""
1,"I've been here a handful of times and each time my experience has been average.  I primarily continue to come here because it's only a few blocks from my house and it's an easy place to meet clients for meetings. However, having said all of that, I highly doubt I'll be back after my experience this morning.\n\nI arrived this morning to read the paper and relax.  I always order the huevos rancheros because it's always been good to me.  I've had clients who have ordered other items on the menu and have been very disappointed (I have had two friends order a dish that came with a biscuit--each time, the biscuits had the consistency of a rock).  Anyway, for whatever reason, I decided to live dangerously and order something else.  I ordered the egg white omelet with home fries and whole wheat toast.  It arrived and was nothing unique or off-the-charts.  But hey, it tasted good.  After I was done polishing that off, I still had a hankering (yeah, that's right--a hankering) for something else.  Considering how full I was, I needed something small.  I remembered seeing blueberry pancakes on the menu, so I asked my server how many came with a side order.  He told me a stack of two or four. I asked him if they were gigantic and he said no, they were typical pancakes.  I put in an order for two.  When they arrived they looked good, but like everything else here, were nothing special.  Imagine my surprise when I cut into the short stack and realized only one of them had blueberries in it.  Oh well, what the hell; I ate them both.  After many attempts to get a coffee refill (I was seated on the patio--if you like refills, don't sit there) I gave up and looked at the check.  (Side note: The servers here immediately give you the check after your food arrives.  Their reasoning is that they don't want you to have to wait for the check.  I don't buy it.  I feel rushed when they do this. In fact, they tell you \""No rush\"" when they put it on the table, so clearly I'm not the only one that has wondered about this.)  The check was pretty straightforward, except for the charge related to my two blueberry pancakes (sans blueberries).  For some reason, my server accidentally charged me for the blueberry pancake meal, or so I thought, since he charged me $6.99 for the dish.  I asked about it, and guess what?  It was not a mistake.  This place has the audacity to charge $7 for TWO PANCAKES!!!  What the heck is in them that they cost $3.50 a piece?  Before I wrote this review, I called IHOP  (yes, IHOP--they're across the street from Oink, so they're competition and the food quality is comparable) and asked them how much their double blueberry pancake side costs.  A stack of two costs $3.79 and a stack of four costs $6.99.  Can you explain that to me?  Same size, same ingredients, same zip code, hell, the same street, but Oink charges DOUBLE!  Anyway, considering the outrageous prices, the average service (servers are nice, but not very quick with the refills, or anything else, except the check), and the average/slightly above average food, I feel like I can do better.  IHOP, here I come!"
4,"Their $9 exterior car wash was fantastic.  The exterior of my car was really clean, cleaner than the brush car washes, and since it's a hand wash, better for the paint on my car.  A+"
1,"Not bad, a little oily. Not sure that I like it. Might have to try it again."
3,"The W is definitely one of the more 'hip' hotels in Old Town, if you are looking for a more lively vibe, as opposed to relaxing, this is probably where you should stay.  I have to say all staff I have ever encountered here from the valet guys, to the bartenders, servers etc have always been outstanding.  The rooms are nice and modern and they serve their customers needs around the clock.  It is within walking distance to Old Town nightlife and shopping at the boutiques, galleries and Scottsdale Fashion Square mall.  \n\nI am a big fan of Sushi Roku, the restaurant attached to the W. I have always had great service, food and cocktails there.  With this prime location you are also within a rock throw of many other fine dining establishments, cute local cafes and bars.  \n\nThe pool parties in the summer are rocking with DJs spinning tunes, and Scottsdale's finest (or as some call them Snotsdale's finest) prancing around 95% naked, and possibly 10% filled with plastic.  At night this same pool area transforms itself into an energized nightlife spot.  \n\nMy last visit to the W I stopped in on a random Sunday evening to grab a cocktail with a friend and I was impressed.  There were a quite a few patrons enjoying their Sunday Fundays and the bartender made sure to keep the vibe going.  It was some of the best people watching I have done in a while... The lobby bar had cool lounge music vibing in the background.  There were some hotel patrons with some escort-ish looking guests, which entertained us while time with our cocktails passed.  \n\nI end up here on rather impromptu occassions, but every time has never been a disappointment."
1,"We went for breakfast and had been wanting to try it out. We ordered mimosas and breakfast the food was ok the eggs were over done the chicken fried steak was a little soggy. The best part was the waitress who was a little \""off\"" after she spilled half the champagne and water she informed us she was drunk. We talked to the manager who informed us she was \""hungover\"" he removed the alcohol and the eggs Benedict from our bill. We are planning on trying it again with the hopes that we get \""sober\"" service next time!"
2,"1/21/10\nOrdered the duck club http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=7A5VAyqfTeIMbaoicdd9GA minus the red wine tomato jam and instead had pesto on the side, along w/ the roasted garlic aioli and the side of fries that come with the entree.  Looked great- the fries were perfect (!), but, and perhaps the absence of the red wine tomato jam had something to do with it, I didn't find the sandwich to be anything to write home about.  The delicious and crispy apple-smoked bacon and roasted garlic aioli were big pluses and helped to round out this review to three stars.  The tiramisu I had for dessert was very good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=AaTAT23mL5rguQtrmDEbNw  Your usual espresso-soaked ladyfingers layered w/ sweet mascarpone and cocoa, BUT w/ the added toffee-crunch of pine nut brittle!  Oh... I could use a few bites of that pastry right now :)\n\nService was a little lacking- I had noticed a woman busily jotting down the night's specials and had asked my server what else were being served (if anything struck my fancy, I'd have added more to my tab), but he would not and DID NOT go to any lengths to get the info.  Lo, and behold, as I was walking out the door, I looked at the board and, sure enough, there were at least three items that I would've gladly ordered for take-out had my server relayed the info.  Hey, it was his and The Parlor's loss in tips and sales!\n\nI wanted to sit at the bar area this time, to get a different perspective of the place, but I didn't care for the austere metal chairs that contrasted w/ the rest of the wooden furniture.  Found it jarring, especially since I felt that the rest of the venue to be cozy and inviting!"
2,"Aside from my experience today ... the barista took some time to acknowledge me, then I think forgot about me cause my one small iced drink took fooorreverrr...THEN sent me off with the wrong drink!!! (I ordered an iced white mocha and was given something w caramel) I was extremely irritated, but at least the wrong drink still tasted ok. Not the best, but whatev I dealt w it... Anyway. .. it's usually a pretty yummy place for coffee.. but with my experience today I had to lower the rating. Hopefully it was just one bad day w that barista. We all have those days."
0,"This place is a freaking disaster and nightmare. They have to be paying people to go on and write reviews because I can't believe anyone would actually return to this establishment. \n\nFirst of all it's an Italian restaurant in a strip mall next to a sushi joint and a closed down Indian buffet. I don't know why that makes them think they can charge $13 a plate for chicken alfredo but regardless we ordered. \n\nI ordered the lasagna and my bf ordered the chicken alfredo. They both came with salads. I asked for blue cheese with my house (which I didn't get) and my boyfriend who hates salad got the Caesar. Ps we asked if he could substitute the small side salad for anything else like soup and the waitress said no. \n\nThe house dressing was so salty it burned my lips, sorry, I don't enjoy salt on my salad. \n\nThen the food finally came and my boyfriends alfredo was dried out and again soooo salty and my lasagna... don't even get me started... disgusting... AGAIN SALTY... what is with the fricken salt!!\n\nWe were starving and hoping for large portions but we only managed to choke down half of our mediocre portions of overpriced food.\n\nIf you thought that was bad then you should hear about our drinks... My bf ordered bud light which they only had 2 bottles on site so then he had to drink their draft beer and pay the price of their stupid craft draft beer... \n\nWe finally got our check and I knew it was going to be expensive but the waitress charged me $7 each for my well vodka and diet drink... Who the H3LL charges $7 for a well drink!!?!? The BF's Bud Lights were $6.50 TOTAL. I thought it must be a mistake so I asked the waitress if that was the case (maybe she entered the drink wrong) which she did... It should have been $6 for a well and diet?!?!? WTH She said she would refund my $2 but by that point she could keep her $2 and shove it... \n\nWe promptly walked over to Desert Babes Sports Grille, where I got a well and diet for $3 my bf got a big bud light for $3.75 and ordered a delicious appetizer to settle our starving stomachs.\n\nHorrible, expensive and disgusting.. I hope to g0d they close soon."
2,not as good as expected..... I guess I like Cora more.....\nThe Montreal putine was too salty to have a bite. :(
1,"I went with a Chinese friend who ordered in Chinese.  When one of the dishes arrived and she didn't like the look of it she then shouted a lot at the waiter (in Chinese).  After that the food was exceptional.  Easily the best Chinese food I've had in Central Illinois.  (I admit, that's a low standard.)\n\nHowever, I've never been able to recreate this experience.  And how I've tried!  I ended up asking my Chinese friend to write me a note in Chinese ordering these same dishes from the Chinese menu.  I show the crumpled and worn note to the waiter when I go by myself.  But the food is never as good.  I expect it was the shouting.  Now that my friend has moved away, I expect it will never be that good again.\n\nWithout my friend to help us, this is a mediocre place."
0,3 strikes and you are out.  I've now given this place 3 tries.  Not going back again.  The service was not good and the food was only mediocre at best.
2,"I love their Sunday special--they certainly don't hold back on the meat part (you get chicken, ribs, brisket and pulled pork); but they skimp on the sides.  This is the second time we've had sides that do not even come close to filling the containers--the mac and cheese was short at leas an inch from the top.  We had four of us and each got a tablespoon (and a little one at that).  I even told the gal who took the order to make sure the side containers were full; but I guess she didn't.  The next time, I'm going to open the containers while I'm there and make sure they don't fall short."
1,"I have them such a glowing review before. \nI am really disappointed.\n\nEven though my first customor service rep was wonderful, this time I got a really rude lady named Tracy.  I just did not like the way she talked to me so much so that I just didn't even book a second trip.\n\nThere are so many competitors and the economy is not great right now.  Companies cannot afford to have the worst customer service.  I did call  Detours.  They were quite helpful."
4,Awesomely authentic German bier!
3,"Great locals casino.  I think this is where they filmed 21.  Anyway, craps tables here are really good.  The circle bar is ok, you get a lot of cougars that come through.  It's about 15 mins off the strip and you get your money's worth.  Rooms are great, very modernized which is always a plus.  Pool area is very nice, my ex-roommate used to be a bartender here.  The good thing about it is that at times, it's a great place to come and chill when you're not in the mood to run on the strip since it's very laid back.  Everyone comes here for their massive Bingo Room or if they want to go bowling.  The theatre here is also really good but stay away on weekends as it overpopulates with a mass amount of local teenie boppers and high school kids loitering, but security does a good job to kick them out past 10.\n\nIt's right across the street from a small shopping center (Best Buy, Marshalls, Gas stations, COSTCO, etc) which is convenient.  If you like Green Valley casino, you'll definitely love this place as it's under the same ownership/design."
3,Really nice Steakhouse. The food was absolutely fine and the stuff very friendly. We will come back as soon we are back in Montreal!
2,"There are slim to none eateries within walking distance from the tire shop we were at, (and we were starving) so pizza it is! I'll admit, I was mildly concerned at first, the reviews for this place were blunt and despairing.\n\nThe pizza shop is owned and ran by a rough around the edges Kosovonian family and unfortunately customer service isn't their strong suit. They weren't blatantly rude, they were just straight to the point and a little cold.\n\nLet's talk about the food, it was $2 a slice and 50 cents per topping.\n\nPizza crust: my crust was pretty great! Nice and crispy, not too thin and not thick. I'm typically picky with crust and normally won't eat it, but it had good flavor. (Edit: my boyfriend said his crust was soggy...whoops! lol) \nPizza body: It was soft, a little closer to the soggy end. (Still not too bad, if you can deal with that)\nPizza sauce: Not bad, but also not too bold in flavor. \nPizza topping: Very generous! Lots of ham covered the entire Hawaiian pizza, plus a mountain of pineapple. There were also a nice amount of pepperoni and mushrooms on the other slice. \nCheese: Decent. There was a good amount of melty mozzarella. \nSize: Nice decent slice. (It filled me up)\n\nNote: Even though they were generous with the pepperoni, it wasn't the highest of quality and didn't have the best flavor. Not even salty. Reminded me of the ready to eat pepperoni in packages such as hormel. \n\nJalape\u00f1o poppers: $4.99 hot hot hot!  (In temperature) Be careful. In a fit of hunger, I definitely burned the rooftop of my mouth. The jalape\u00f1o wasn't spicy at all and thinner than I've had. Also a generous amount of scalding hot cheese with a nice crispy crust. It wasn't poor, it just wasn't groundbreaking - average at most. I wouldn't think of ordering it again. \n\nDamage: We paid roughly about $17 for 2 slices, jalape\u00f1o poppers, and a coke can. Hey, we even handed him a hundo and he gave back the correct change. So call us lucky! No scamy scams this time."
0,"Unfortunately, all of the reviews below are accurate.  I just rented a car last night at Thrifty and it took 1 hour and 45 minutes to get through the line to the one person working at the counter.  All of the other car rental places, with the exception of Dollar (right next door), had no lines or minimal lines that were moving quickly.  There is something seriously wrong from a management perspective if you expect people to wait in line that long (longer than the actual plane ride) to get a car.  Many people left the line or went over to other car rental companies to pay more for a car just to avoid the line.  I travel to Vegas frequently and consistently have seen lines of this magnitude with Thrifty.  Unfortunately, the price of the rental car lured me in this time. Never again. I will gladly pay more for a car from another company. The line and lack of adequate service made me miss my dinner reservation with friends. \n\nI highly recommend that someone from Thrifty Corporate visit this location to whip management into shape and create a much better flow system to be respectful to customers.  Until then, I recommend that you look elsewhere to rent."
4,"Brennan's is a top notch market.  They offer a wide variety of fresh fruit and vegetables all year long, bread from local bakers, a full meat counter, and a large outdoor gardening area in the summer.  There's an extensive wine and liquor store in back, with a knowledgeable staff to help you navigate.  To top it all off, they carry an insane variety of cheese, much of which you can sample - get your squeaky fresh cheese curds here if you missed them at the Farmer's Market."
2,"This is about the fourth visit to Goldmans and although a lot of people rave about it, I don't think it's as good as Chompies.\nI had the pastrami sandwich on this visit, and although it was good, it simply doesn't have the flavor that Chompies has. \nThat being said, it's still a good choice for a big deli sandwich, and a good value when considering the size of the sandwiches.\nTheir breads are very fresh, and portions huge, but still, not as tasty as Chompies...."
2,"This place is okay. It didn't wow me or anything. Just a pretty run-in-the-mill place in my opinion. It was way too crowded for my liking. I stood in line for about 5 minutes before I even got to order my food. They give you a bowl 2-3 times the size of chipotle but instead of filling it with rice, beans, meat, and the salad items, they skimp on the rice and beans and pound it with lettuce. The shredded chicken was good but nothing special. Honestly this place is okay but it's not a must try or anything."
2,"Spring Training stay with hubby and 13 month old \nThis is a do it yourself, be on your own hotel, what I mean is after check in you're pretty much on your own\nAs a mom when I think vacation I think other people doing the work, not the case \nAfter checking in you get back in your car, drive down the hill, locate your room, then unload and carry in your bags\nWe brought our own play pen and highchair since we've experienced issues in the past, we requested a fridge and booked a single king room\nThe room was spacious although the hallways were a bit musty \nFYI this hotel does NOT have tubs in any of its rooms so we had to shower with our little guy\nAfter unpacking we decided we wanted to go out to eat and check out the hotel layout, the only options on the property were the pool grill or top of the rock resturant, what we found was an outdoor bar you could order food at while drunks smoke cigars a table away from you and a restaurant that is not child friendly and pricey\nWe ended up at top of the rock and after 15 minutes the restaurant was able to scrounge up a highchair, the food was decent, hubby had the steak (which I thought tasted like liquid smoke) and I had the pot roast which still had string on it and served with veggies drenched in sauce, they didn't have an actual kids menu but the waitress was able to get us a small serving of mac n cheese and fruit for our little guy\nWe ordered room service for breakfast, decent price and yummy and ate at the buffet another morning, buffets a better deal at $16 with an omelette and waffle bar \nWe went to the pool around 6pm, it was dead and the water was freezing, the jacuzzis are nice but you feel like a mountain goat running up and down the hillside to get to them or your towels\nOn the way back from a game a staff member flagged us down and offered us a ride back up the hill, on the ride he mentioned they do it all day during Spring training, although it was the first time hearing about it \nThe fact the stadium is within walking distance is about the only thing that would get me to stay here again \nThey should really consider a more family friendly dining option (even if its just seasonal)"
0,"There are much better places to stay in the Marriott family. Skip this place.\nDirty towels, pool under renovation (which no one told us about ahead of time), lots of broken down things in the room, inconsistent stories from the managers (Grace & Saul - have they even had any sort of training??).  There's absolutely no level of security either. No card scan to operate elevator - seemingly anyone could walk in off the street and have access to all floors. \n\nRenaissance Hotels come with the reputation of a  certain level of service, and this place is a miss on all levels. There are so many better options within a short walking distance of the convention center. Save yourself the hassle and stay there."
1,"We had brunch here this morning and while the food was great, the service was horrible.  Also, it was great to find a steak knife on top of the toilet paper dispenser in the ladies room, glad no one's lottle girl found this.  I'm soo disappointed, now I'm gonna have to find a new place for brunch!  This place needs to get their s**t together, not pro!"
4,"I figure since I'm on my way over there for an evening of fun filled events,I'd take a moment while my nails are drying to review the joint.\nI like it here.Comfy space,great staff,fun outgoing people.Inside is roomy enough,but the patio is home.They used to have a fire pit that was the ginchiest,but firepits plus  drunky people does not make for happy endings...So they did away with it making even more useable space.It's all good.\nEvery now and again they grill up some burgers that are tasty too.\nSee everyone who's going in a lil bit."
1,"There's 70 reviews, so I'm gonna keep it short. Good burgers, but in the very interesting Las Vegas burger wars I'd rate it an also ran. That's not to say it doesn't have its merits it DOES. Great fries. \n\nYou also can order take out at a bunch of Kiosks located around the casino. If you have a room at the Mirage, its a snap to order some food and take it back to your room. An excuse to actually spend some time in your room, novel! \n\nTake out service is spot on, with a loaded goody bag of condiments. Not Burger Bar or Mesa or Bradley Ogden quality, but its a serious six dollar burger and the fries win the contest.  \n\nOften a wait. Consider take out and laze on over to one of the benches near the volcano and do some people watching.\n\nRecommended."
4,"I Love Akahana! I think most people don't realize it exists because it is located in a small shopping center beside a little bookstore in Plaza Midwood, but if you've never been and love shush, this is the place to be. They always have buy one get one free specials, tasty drinks and tons of fun rolls to choose from."
2,"Stopped at this Macy's to kill a lil time. Took back a Guess watch that was purchased recently and appeared to be a lemon. After some strong negotiations and resistance from a sales associate manager Frankie was called to the scene. Frankie heard us out, inspected the watch then took the issue to her general manager. Finally it was approved to do a even exchange for a new Guess watch...so I was refitted and on my way (:"
2,"Came here with an open mind and a large group...\n\nWas not sure what to expect, but on our way over we read, on yelp of course, how amazing the meatballs were..\n\nWe ordered food to share and the servings size were decent enough to share but not over the top a small but decent serving..we started with the mixed appetizer plate and the meatballs..the app plate was good has a wide selection for everyone to try something..we orderd two for our group and it was more then enough..\n\nThe meatballs alone would get a 5 star, I absolutely loved them and the sauce it came in was amazing..I was somewhat selfish with the meatballs because they were so good.\n\nI split a plate of spaghetti with my daughter and it was good, could of used more sauce as they actually bring it out already split, but good nonetheless.\n\nService: is ok, waited about 20 minutes to get a glass of wine, on top of that it was kind of stuffy and average at best..compared to many other places in LV service was lacking..\n\nAll in all 3 stars is good, the place is really pricey for what you get..I doubt I will be back unless someone is adamant about going."
2,"Prices are good for the quality of food.  The service is not good.  They are friendly, but do not plan on having someone come over to you , asking if you need anything unless you ask.  (Just my experience)\n\nThe injera bread smelled like sour milk on my visit.  First time I ever had injera bread that smelled like that. \n\nLove the tea and the lentils.  The beef was very tough.\n\nNice big screen tv, with Ethiopian channels and music.\n\nWill I return? For take out, possibly."
1,"I travel frequently, work late, and don't always have time to make reservations before a late meal opportunity. We were greeted In an unwelcoming manner at 9pm at this Morton's. That along with waiting a solid 10 minutes before getting menus just made us feel even more \""rude\"". The stuffy vibe needs to change for us to come back....Morton's is nice and convenient from the Ritz,  but i'd drive the extra few miles to City Hall next time.\nThe food was good although the Seafood platter - oysters, lobster, crab were below average compared to other Mortons. Steak is probably better in the desert."
2,"I tried the lunch buffet here a few weeks ago, and the food was pretty good.  We discovered the buffet on our last day in Vegas, after some horrible Studio Cafe experiences.  The flat daily rate seems like an excellent deal when you consider what you pay for food in Vegas.  The seating area was freezing for some reason, but our waitress was great.  She noticed that we were shivering and suggested coffee/tea, and she kept them refilled."
4,"I've been there twice - once at night, and another time at sunset for a breathtaking panoramic view of Las Vegas both in the day and at night. Of course, Vegas is always prettier at night. Still, watching the sunset is always a beautiful experience....\n\nAs for the rides - I've always been a fan of thrill rides... now pair that with hanging off the edge of a building as you see the city below you or being shot 160 feet in the air at 45 miles per hour as you overlook the city.\n\nI personally think it's well worth the $30."
1,"Much like the rest of the strip, this place is ridiculously overpriced and the food isn't that good. If you're hungry but don't feel like a sandwich, entrees will run from $25-$35. Go to a Buffet and get your money's worth of food, if not in quantity at least it'll have quality."
3,"I adore this place! It is always packed and the service is wonderful. This is my 3rd visit in 2 months; the portions are huge, the options are endless and the waitstaff is knowledgeable. My only advice is not to order any of the steak menu items. The sirloin was fatty and just bad (one star subtraction). Everything else I have had from sushi to chicken to shrimp has been off the charts delicious and fresh. Grab a few friends, get the sushi boat and prepared to be blown away. A hidden gem that is in our regular rotation. CHECK IT OUT!!!"
2,"This store is a great idea.  It's large, has a wide vareity of items and lots of staff willing to help you.  I feel like it is the kind of place where if you are willing to become a frequent flier and figure out which days are the best shopping days, you will be able to find find some winners.  You will have to work for it though.  \n\nI'm not an avid thrifter, but the prices did seem a little high to me.  I realize the money is going to a good cause, but I was quite surprised by the price points.  While most of the items were in fairly good condition, I did open up a dresser and all the drawers were full of cat hair.  Yuck.  I mean I realize the stuff is used, but a little cleaning goes a long way when you are charging top dollar for used items."
1,Only reason they get two stars is because their pies are great. Terrible service and don't have enough people working so it takes half an hour to get anyone to even acknowledge that you are waiting.
2,"I went here for lunch and didn't want to go for AYCE. I was just in the mood for some kimchi and Korean BBQ and Yelp kept telling me I needed to go here. So here I went.\n\nI walked in and the place was empty. Just two waitresses and they looked at me like I was crazy when I said it was only a party of one. My waitress sat me and gave me a menu but didn't ask me if I wanted anything to drink. When she took my order, she still didn't ask me if I wanted anything to drink. \n\nMy food came out and she still didn't ask me if I wanted anything. I had to finally ask her. After that I never saw her again, until it was time for me to pay. So I think I can also confirm that the service here is spotty. Maybe they just don't care to be nice. \n\nHowever, my food made up for the experience. It was about $12 before tax and tip. I ordered a lunch plate with meat and noodles and it was good. I really did enjoy my lunch. I left satisfied and full but with the crappy service, I just don't know if I would return."
0,"Have been going to this place for about 2 years because it was close by and had decent food.  The wait staff has always been extremely great and very pleasant.  Unfortunately I will never go to this place ever again and will tell everyone I know to do the same.  Their food has gotten extremely bad...too much salt on the all breakfast food and everything else is not cooked properly.  They just put out a new menu and raised their prices by over a dollar.  Pretty sure he did that because of his other failed businesses...a mortgage company that tanked along with other real estate investments.  They don't take reservations...or I was told that when I called to make some.  So we showed up an hour early to get a good seat for the football game.  I sat at a table and then I was told to move because someone had reservations.  So we moved to another table.  Then at this table we were told to move again because of reservations.  Then we finally got a table in their back room.  So we were all watching the football games and enjoying our overpriced food and watered down drinks.  Then with about 5 minutes left to go in the game we were told that we had to leave because someone else had reservations at our table and the Owner and Manager didn't even have the guts to tell us this themselves.  They made a tiny 19yr old girl come up to 10 guys to tell them to move.  She started to cry because she felt so bad to tell us and still no help from management.  Completely classless establishment.  We offered to share our table but they wanted us to move somewhere else entirely.  If that wasn't enough, my wife and her friend were out on the patio getting some air and over heard the owner talking badly about us using profanity all over. What a classy man talking about the people who keep him in business.  What's the funniest part of everything.....the people that wanted the reservations weren't even eating or drinking."
3,"The more I come here the more I like it. The place is clean, ticket prices are reasonable if not a little more expensive than Harkins, and there usually isn't as much of a crowd.\n\nI have also found the people at this location to be a better behaved bunch during the movies.\n\nThey also will honor the $1 refill Harkins cups which was always one of my big reasons for going to Harkins theaters all the time.\n\nThey don't have the biggest screens in the world though even compared to some other theaters."
2,"Breakfast here is A-OK and props to them for still serving eggies at 2pm (the prefect time for a Vegas breakfast ). It' a simple place. Small oyster bar inside and a dozen or so tables for dining 'al fresco' (there's no way you're forgetting you're still inside). The breakfast menu was simple enough - omelet's, a bagel sammie, pancakes - nothing out of the ordinary. My omelet (the Vegas) was filled with a few veggies, some avocado, cheddar and bacon. All super at soaking up the booze from the prior evening. The mimosas are $5, if you need to crush that hangover, and are standard sized but tasty. Overall, a solid breakfast in a creepy PH mall area. Standard Vegas morning. \n\nPro tip: Planning on drinking mass quantities? The bar/restaurant directly across from it seems to have an all day happy hour going on."
2,"Once just a Panera ripoff, Atlanta Bread has since added many more of its own creations. I tried the Italian vegetable panini the other night: tasty but expensive, given the portion size. Even after finishing the pickle and kettle chips that came with it, I felt barely satiated.\n\nDecor is nice, as is the free wifi, but service is somewhat lacking. Nonetheless, this place feels like an adequate option if you're in the mood for a sandwich. (The pastas, however, are quite bland.)"
3,"This particular In-N-Out location is a decent one. Clean on the inside. Orders are always correct. Never too busy or too crowded.\n\nNow, I'm not all that into the burgers at In-N-Out. I know, blasphemy! But whatever. I personally do not care for them. They're not bad by any means, but I don't think they're all that good either.\n\nWhat I do LOVE and crave here are the animal-style fries. Say what? Just say yes. Get your fries animal-style. They are delicious and oh-so-craveworthy.  Yum yum yum! I'm craving them just writing this."
3,"Was here last night for a Family Soft Opening. This used to be Carmine's but was gutted and looks great. Plenty of TVs to watch the game. \n\nThe food and drink selection was excellent. The \""Mad Mule\"" was a great cocktail. Food was excellent, very large portions. I enjoyed the Chicken Salad and it was delicious. \n\nI have high expectations for this bar. Hopefully becomes the new local spot!"
4,"Very cool people, a good mix of independence and help. Very team oriented. Really cool box and loved the programming. Thanks Joe!!"
0,"My daughter and I went last Sunday for lunch. We were seated in about 10 minutes so that was good however, that was the beginning of the end. After 15 minutes I had to get the attention of the busboy and asked him if he could be sure we weren't forgotten.  About 5 minutes later the busboy brought water and said the server was coming. NOT!  We left after another 15 minutes passed and went to Red Robin."
2,"Had a very nice meal Sunday evening, the restaurant is very quaint. The server was blas\u00e9.  \nThe black board specials were not explained very well, it may have been a language barrier or compete indifference on her part but she failed to help us understand the preparations when asked. She droned in expressionless monotone \""there is lamb, a salad with ham and the lobster'.  Then complete silence pad and pen at ready.\n\nSo, we ordered off the regular menu:The seafood de mer, duck confit, and cod were all delicious.\nIf I am in Montreal again I would go back.  The setting and food were good.  Waitress perhaps a a bit tired or stressed out."
4,"Mmmmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmm...Never Fails...\n\nThis place is UNBELIEVABLE for breakfast and Lunch (i have heard great things about dinner as well although i have yet to enjoy it).  \ni have only been for lunch twice, but both times were fantastic.  The first time i had the Burger (wonderful) and the second time i believe it was the Halibut (could have been Seabass) and was equally as delicious (i have posted a photo).\n\nWhat i really want to talk about is their Breakfast though...OMG-favorite spot in town.  I am a huge eggs benny fan and they have this Mediterranean version that is out of this world.  It's on Focaccia bread with prosciutto and this red bell pepper hollandaise sauce...SO GOOD (i have also included a photo of this dish).  Also, try their green eggs and ham.  :)\n\nHope you all enjoy this place as much as i do!!  Bon Appetit!"
2,"Overpriced, slow, and undercooked vegetables. The pasta was the only highlight. Good atmosphere."
0,"Sloooow service. Basically they seat you and forget about you. I watched it happen to everyone who came in. Food wasn't very good, either."
3,"We tried this place because there was a coupon in the Entertainment Book. Since we like the mexican restaurant inside the Tuscany, we figured it was worth trying.\n\nWe had two sandwiches- we split it (our MO). It was very good, surprisingly, for a casino cafe. It's about $10 per person, without the Entertainment coupon. We've been here a couple times. The service is very good. The atmosphere is nice, and this restaurant is spacious inside. There are tables and chairs as well as booth seating available. \n\nIt's truly \""hit or miss\"" at these casino cafes. This is probably one of those little known/forgotten casinos and two of the restaurants here are really good."
2,"Kitty's cafe is located in the El Cortez Hotel and Casino....... \nand you get the friendly service in here that you can experience everywhere else in this hotel.\nIt is an old style vegas hotel diner, with booths and the traditional counter service.\nThe ladies working there call everyone \""honey\"" or they know most of them by name. \n\nThe menu is what you would expect from a downtown hotel diner.\nNothing fancy, but large portions.\nI tried the grilled sourdough melt - with turkey and ham.\nLarge, average.....\nOn this day there was a \""new cook\"" and the food was slow getting out.\n\nLate at night - it might be the place to get that bite you are needing - (it was for me) ....... otherwise - I am sure you can find better places to eat for the same amount of money.\nYes - all those \""old school $1.99 deals\"" are gone."
4,"Promised myself in the breakfast review I wrote in early July that I would go back for lunch.  Check!  Been twice for lunch now and each time walked away fully, full and happy.\n\nFirst trip brought fried catfish, candied yams and a small salad with blue cheese dressing.  The catfish is fried whole and comes with some spicy, mayo-based sauce on the side.  Splash on some hot sauce and a squeeze of lemon and you get, YUM!  The sides were good as well.\n\nSecond visit, I went with the lunch special of the day, beef liver and onions.  OK, I know some of you just went, \""GROSS\""!  Don't be haters!  Liver is delicious, especially when it's prepared like this.  Slight char on it and covered in a great tasting   brown onion gravy. Tried the mac n cheese this time and it made me smile also.  They also bring a small individual loaf of cornbread and honey butter with lunch orders.  It is moist and flavorful and is a great add to the meal.\n\nService was fast and friendly on both lunch visits just like at breakfast.  Thankfully I work at the Southern end of Tryon and Mert's is towards the Northern end, just across from the Hearst Tower on College St.  Let's just say, I need that longish walk back to cubeville after a big, delicious lunch like this..."
1,"My friend and I were pretty disappointed. Everything sounded so great and unique, but my mussels with chorizo just tasted burnt...I'm not even sure how you would burn something like that, but I digress. I can't even remember what my friend ordered, but again, it was something that appealed to our foodie sense on paper, but was nothing too special in actuality. Too bad..."
4,I'm down 20 pounds and loving it!  Adam Luckette takes awesome care of me whether its diet or health. The staff is amazing!  Give them a try!
2,"My husband and I selected Va Bene for our wedding reception. We were having a small wedding, 40 people, and had heard Va Bene was an excellent restaurant.\n\nThe wait staff and food was delicious. We could have not have asked for better service or food for our reception. People complemented the service and food - for that I would have given 5 stars...\n\nHowever, I took a couple of stars off due to the manager Donna and lack of communication. We originally started talking back in November over email as we live in NYC. It was easy enough to book and she provided us with a simple menu which we were pleased with. I emailed her to ask to meet with her in February as I was flying out to finalize things before the April wedding. She agreed (we did have to change the date since my flight was cancelled and rescheduled, but she agreed to meet me at the same time the following day). When I arrived Donna was not there - they had no idea that I was coming or when Donna would be in. We waited for a half an hour before Sasha helped us - I was ready to change the venue. Sasha was helpful and nice and offered a food tasting during the week. We came back for the food tasting and Donna met us - although she acted as though she couldn't be bothered with us. Michele, another manager from my understanding, took care of us.  Without Sasha or Michele I would have changed the venue. \n\nDonna was also very hard after that to get in contact with. She took up to a week to respond to us, and the only time we really got any information was when Michele took over the emailing while Donna was on vacation. Additionally, Donna forgot to inform Michele that my husband would be by the day of the wedding to drop things off - we agreed at 3:30 so the room would be ready. When he arrived nothing was set up...\n\nIn the end, the food, wait staff, Michele and Sasha were wonderful. I would eat there again, however, I would shy away from arranging another big event."
2,"OK so today someone in my office brought me a sandwich from City Market Deli. It was the Santa Fe Club. Oven Gold Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, Alfalfa Sprouts, Chipotle Mayo served on Our Toasted Multi-Grain Bread.\n\nThe bread is very good and the sandwich has a good amount of flavorful turkey. The chipotle mayo has just the right amount of heat. Overall a very tasty sandwich!"
2,Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  I am from Philadelphia where there are excellent restaurants with iron chefs so my viewpoint may be a bit skewed.   The food was good but not great or amazing.  Every dish (except the house salad) was over salted.  My husband had the tuna and I had the seabass. They were both very good but as I said before not great.  We would go there again but for sushi/raw items not necessarily the cooked menu items.  The salad was was the highlight for me (house salad) and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too.   Overall the service was very good but slow.  Our waiter was one of the most knowledgeable wait staff we have encountered since moving from PA.
1,"Had dinner there last week ...... went there with great anticipation because of its legendary status in New York ....... mildly disappointing but easily correctable .... the place itself is fun ... its old-timey Italian restaurant decor with all the celeb photos hung on wall ... very professional and most attentive service...... good food but not great ...... seems like the kitchen is trying to '' play it safe'' and the result is a very ample portion of just slightly above average entrees ...... my veal dish was good but not as good as I had hoped based on the Rao's reputation ( hype ? ) .... so they have a nice,fun setting,great servers and decent offerings but if they really got into that kitchen and tweaked their prep a bit ...... they'd improve on a product that is just a tad on the bland side. I hope they address this as it is a fun restaurant with good personnel ."
1,"I want to love this place, but I just don't.\nEverytime I eat here, I wish I were eating at Olive Garden....\nFor a chain, I just don't have any memorable items that I'd come back for (as opposed to Olive Garden's crack like breadsticks)\n\nMeh"
3,"I had read a few reviews about Bahama Bucks on Yelp and I've been wanting to try it for a while ... We finally made it in! After the first few bites of our shaved ice, we definitely felt like we've been missing out!\n\nWe ordered the small root beer float shaved ice & the regular passion fruit & mango shaved ice, both topped with cream. I'd say that on the normal day, the small is definitely plenty (might have even gone for the baby size) but the regular is great for an extra treat. I personally liked the passion fruit a little bit better than the mango but the combination definitely worked well together. I think for the one I got, I would've skipped the cream. It was good (definitely didn't take away from the passion fruit & mango flavor) but it wasn't so impressive that I want to pay the extra little bit for it again. When I had ordered, the man working who suggest it had said that with the passion fruit & mango, it could go either way & he was right.\n\nAs far as the service goes, it was constantly busy but there were quite a few people working so we got our order in & got our shaved ice very quickly. We were offered a punch card as well. Minus one star, however, because when we went to the counter when we first walked in, one of the guys working was rude. He looked highly annoyed when I said that I had never been in and wanted suggestions and actually walked away! Another guy who was right next to him quickly stepped up and was helpful in picking out flavors. It's a bit expensive but so delicious! We'll be back!"
0,"Second time getting pizza delivered today and it's my second time being disappointed. Both times the pizza wasn't even cut. I had to get out my own pizza cutter! I ordered hand-tossed pizza and what I got was about as thin as a piece of paper. I try to pick a piece up and it just flops down. The crust was uneven- thick on one half and super thin on the other half. It was warm, not hot. Tasted pretty salty. Not happy at all!!"
4,"When you think of Las Vegas you usually don't think of jumping on trampolines and falling on yo butt. However, I'm glad we tried something different, because this made for one of the highlights of my trip. \n\nYou pay a relatively good price for the amount of time spent. We all got the hour for $15 dollars through the online store listed on here. A lot cheaper than back home.\n\nUpon arriving we had to fill out forms and waivers, which is why they tell you to arrive half hour before your reserved time. Then we waited in line, and were helped by this nice dude. Then, this other lady who seemed like she was the head honcho started bossing him around and was a bit rude and rough around the edges to us. Gee, don't need to be so mean about it. \n\nThen we were finally given our tags with our time slot on it, along with these bright orange socks that felt like they had stickies on the bottom... for a quick moment I felt like a gecko. \n\nAfter packing all of our stuff into a locker (be sure to bring quarters), we explored around. There was a basketball slam dunk portion, as well as a foam pit, extra big trampoline section, and a dodgeball arena.\n\nThe basketball arena section had two lanes. One of the lanes had a smaller basketball hoop for those who were on the shorter side. The other lane had a much taller one. The only thing was that though there were two lanes,  you only could go one at a time. In my mind I thought I would be able to slam dunk it, but alas I failed miserably and missed the hoop completely.\n\nThe next one we tried was the foam pit. There were four lanes on this one, but only two people could go at a time. There was a trampoline right before you jumped in, so this was a perfect opportunity to try a front flip. Or so I thought... I ran up to the trampoline and tried my best to do what I've seen gymnasts do on the TV do.  My front flip turned into an awkward side cannon ball.  I also ended up pretty far away from the starting point, which made it pretty hard to make it back through the foam pit of doom. My friends made it back pretty fast, but it took me kind of a while as I tried to wade through the those foam blocks. It made for great laughs till the point our stomachs were sore. A sock off, abs sore, and some sweat later, what do you know? I was finally out of that pit. Haha!!\n\nWe finally went to the giant trampolines and we found a spot where all 5 of us could jump.  We weren't that fancy or brave enough to try to do what the other little kids were doing, which were back flips and things of the like. I attempted though, but at most got an A for effort. \n\nThe last thing that we did was play dodgeball, we, the girls sat one out as I was upstairs on the parent section taking pictures of the guys dominate other people at dodgeball. It was 3 minutes per game and things got pretty competitive, but it was all in good fun. They guys must have played at least 6 games since the same people kept on challenging them. Intense.\n\nThen like Cinderella, the clock striked our time and the guy working there was quick to tell us that our time there was up. Too much fun, a great workout in a pretty new place. Made for great memories and lots of laughs."
4,Good food!!!
2,"I went here for lunch and had decent food.  The view of the man made lake in the shopping center is pretty cool on a day when the weather is nice.  I went back again at night and they had a great DJ with an artist performing ( Truth of the QC), the place was pretty packed, and the drink specials were awesome.  I think I like this place as a night venue better.  I will be back, but not in a hurry because the University area is a hike from south Charlotte.  I had a fun time nonetheless."
1,"I would have given Kahunaville one star for the service; but I really liked my drink and food. I ordered the big Kahunaville drink that you see in the pictures with the smoke and everything. It was so good and I am still using the cup because it is very fun. I also liked my food; but that's because I love any kind of food that includes pasta let alone penne pasta! But it was like I had to satisfy our server when isn't it the other way around? The server seemed to hate us and everyone else they were serving. By the end of the service we finally got the server to smile once. Mission accomplished!\nWhen we first walked in we weren't sure we had arrived because there was an oxygen bar that took up 80% of the entry to the restaurant. When we finally got noticed, even though there were people right up front at the oxygen bar, we were sat at a table in the back of the restaurant next to the DJ booth at the end of an abandoned stage. HAHA!! This was the most awkward experience at Vegas for us. Do not order the Paradise Sampler if you are very hungry; it doesn't even satisfy one person. The pineapple top and dry ice-filled volcano vase are fillers to make the platter appear bountiful."
2,"I was meeting up with a few friends and this was the suggested meet up point for breakfast / lunch.\n\n\nWith only a few seats this could have been a cosy place to go to but the no heating knocked that one in the head, all the guests that where eating in, kept their jackets on.\n\n\nA good menu on offer from steak sandwiches, daily specials, breakfast's to filled roll's.\n\n\nThe food would have been nice if it had been served on hot plates, as they where served on cold plates the food went cold quickly.\n\n\nThe floor looked as if it hadn't been swept in a day or two, \n\n\nThe coffee is nice not could not fault that."
0,"Only slightly better than average food (for the price range). Excellent service. Horrendously unacceptable atmosphere.  \n\nDined here after 9pm. Looking forward to the first tolerable outdoor temps this summer, sat outside on the patio which we were told was non-smoking. Patio was quiet and peaceful--we were the only table seated out there until several people came out, sat a few tables over from us and started smoking.  Disappointed, we immediately got up and went inside. Asked the waiter about the smoking and he moved our food and drinks inside rather than ask the smokers to smoke elsewhere.\n\nSitting inside was no better.  The group at the small bar was very loud and vulgar. Even a restaurant employee was literally screaming inside the dining room.\n\nWhen we got the check the waiter explained that he took two drinks off the check because the smokers were actually restaurant employees on a smoke break. WTF?!  He would have been better off not telling us that the smokers were employees.  If he didn't tell us we might have considered coming back. Knowing that the manager allowed employees to smoke on the patio while paying guests were dining out there only motivates me to write a review, not return and spend more of my hard-earned money.\n\nNo amount of great service or decent food can make up for a 100% unacceptable, avoidable and miserable restaurant atmosphere. \n\nZero effort was made to show even the most minimal consideration for that fact that paying guests were dining in the restaurant.  What kind of restaurant owner or manager allows the staff to create such a miserable dining experience for customers?"
3,"I would have probably given this 3 stars if not for the awesome green chili stew and the variety of dessert frybreads that rock my world.\n\nThe various frybread tacos are solid, but nothing that exceptional. I like the chorizo one with lots of hot sauce. \n\nIt's a good neighborhood spot when you're in the mood for something a little different, or especially if you've got a sweet tooth! :)"
2,"Great, friendly and attentive service. We had the Caesar salad, duck & scallops. Salad was great, duck was good & very rich. Scallops were so-so & not something I'd recommend ordering. Over all an okay meal, but not one I'd repeat."
2,"This place is a Madison game day staple. The only problem is that this is the case for hundreds of people (and that may be modest). If you are into ass to elbow people, but an incredibly good time, this is the spot for you!"
2,"The food is good for the price, $10.95 + drink. The qualify of the food is pretty good. The steak station was awesome, steak any way you want whether you want medium rare, medium, etc... The salad station very fresh.  The service is great, the waitresses come and clean up often and refills your drink for you.\n\nMAJOR CON: The wait is around 2 hours long!!!! Be prepare to wait for a very long time and don't get too anxious once you get inside, there's another 30 minutes wait inside."
4,"One menu item...  Bob's (Organic) Bad Breath Burger...  You just HAVE to order this!!  Living up to its name, you will have bad breath for the rest of the night.  :)  But, it's definitely well worth it!!"
4,"Heck yeah.  I love Beef Stand.  Cheese fries, check, meatball sub, check.  I am happy with those two things, though their italian beef and hot dogs are good too.  \n\nMy one critique is that the meatball sub is hard to eat; it's more like two huge meatballs accompanied by some bread and sauce.  Maybe that's part of the charm?  It's distressing for me because I can never seem to walk away from this place without getting some red sauce on my shirt.  This is why I never wear white."
1,"Le pain naan \u00e9tait dur et br\u00fbl\u00e9, le riz me semblais tr\u00e8s banal. J'ai pris une entr\u00e9e avec les trois choix (les ognons bhaji \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s bons) Je sugg\u00e8re de prendre un lassi \u00e0 la mangue. Je donne 2 \u00e9toiles sur 5 mais je ne crois pas que mon choix repr\u00e9sente vraiment le Taj; j'ai pris que des plats v\u00e9g\u00e9tariens."
4,"My sweetie and I came here for our anniversary.  The management took better care of us than we could have ever dreamed. Staff, food, view... all amazing. Highly recommend! We'll be back again!"
2,"I would probably go back to this place because of its location and atmosphere.  It is a   relaxed, fun place to be.  Plenty of activities and drink choices.   The service was wonderful.  The server was very professional and friendly. \n\nMy only reason for not giving it more stars was the food.  It was Ok.  I tried the fish and chips.  The fish was okay.  The batter was light and fluffy but bland.. The tarter sauce was boring and bland too.  No zing or even some kind of flavor.  The fries were fresh cut but were so salty making them difficult to eat.  I had to dust the salt off.   The cole slaw was the best part and even that wasn't very exciting.  \n\nMy co-worker who joined me, had the Kale & Sweet Potato Salad.  She enjoyed it except for the pomegranates that come with it but aren't listed in the description on the menu.  I had a bite and did find the dressing to be delicious.  \n\nI'll go back but will try something else on the menu and hopefully it will taste better than this past lunch."
0,"The movies are a typical price and the seating is nice, but do not go there for food. For the price you pay, you are better off visiting any other restaurant in Epicentre. It's funny, the opening video roll talks about how the quality of food is superior and makes you excited you may have a great meal. We ordered a 2 for $25 deal which seems like a good deal until you get the food. The 1/2 order of chicken nachos may not have even had chicken. We couldn't find it! It was just chips and lettuce. I'd hate to see a full order after knowing the 1/2 order size. I ordered the chicken fajita quesadilla which was okay, but not very warm. My boyfriend reported he's had better burgers at Wendy's and his fries were cold. I noticed that people who ordered after us received their food before us. The staff replaced the fries no problem, and they were hot, except they charged me for a side of fries at the end of the movie. When I explained, they took it off no problem. The staff was really nice and they did a great job. Just stinks they have to serve terrible food!\nThat being said, I would probably go back for another movie if I had a Groupon to buy again, but stick with a soda and popcorn. For as rare as I go to the movies, I would most likely go to a regular movie theater next time."
1,"I really wanted to like this place being an avid tea drinker but alas, it was not meant to be. I have been here twice, once with 2 girlfriends for brunch and another time with my boyfriend. The first time I went, I ordered the pear salad, which was decent and my 2 friends ordered scones. One of my friends got her scone almost immediately and the waitress completely forgot about the other one. When she finally remember, she apologized profusely, which was nice but probably shouldn't have happened since there was already one scone ordered for the table. Fine, no biggie, that I can get over. \n\nThe second time I dined here there were quite a few issues. 1. We sat at our table for a while before we were even acknowledged by anyone to get a glass of water. 2. There was a lady on her cell phone the entire hour we were at the restaurant, even though it blatantly says on the menu \""Please don't use cell phones or laptops in the restaurant\"" (I know this isn't the restaurant's fault, but if you are going to call attention to it on your menu, you better be prepared to follow through if someone isn't following orders.) 3. I saw posted on their twitter account the day before that they had a special for brunch that included their potato croquettes. My boyfriend ordered the eggs & bacon (they were out of ham) which comes with the croquette. When the waitress (same one as last time) brought his food out she said their fryer was broken so they couldn't serve the croquette and substituted with a salad, which I'm pretty sure she knew BEFORE he placed the order. She should have mentioned this beforehand. And I'm pretty sure you can fry a croquette in a pan. 4. My sandwich sat on the kitchen counter waiting to be picked up for about 5-10 minutes, our waitress walked by it about a dozen times without even glancing in that general direction but came over to ask if we needed anything. My boyfriend, not being able to hold back said 'yeah, we'll take her sandwich that has been sitting over there forever.' Not the nicest thing to say, but we were so over it at that point. \n\nEvery time our waitress opened her mouth, she was apologizing for something and making excuses (\""it's been crazy in here today\""), regardless of who she was talking to in the restaurant. Maybe if they hired someone else that was able to handle the craziness of a half-full restaurant, this place may have gotten a better rating. \n\nThe only saving grace for Urban Tea Loft is the tea (as you would hope) and their desserts. If you drive by and pick up some dessert to go, it's definitely worth the trip, just don't dine in."
2,"Not my favorite Las Vegas steak experience.\n\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and waited 15 minutes for our table.  It took our waitress another few minutes to arrive, give us menus, etc.  She seemed disinterested the entire time and rarely checked in on us.  We had to ask for refills on our water, alcohol, etc.\n\nThe duck fat fries were amazing, as were their accompanying sauces.  Michael Mina, and his obsession with threes, did well with the three types of fries and sauces.\n\nThe steak wasn't amazing.  It pains me to type that.  I expected to bite into that steak and be like \""mmmmmmmmm\"" but it was more like \""mmm.\""\n\nThe sides I tried were excellent - the truffle mac and cheese was outstanding and the flavors and textures of the creamed spinach made my mouth happy.\n\nThe bathrooms were filthy.\n\nWith so many amazing steak places in Vegas, I expected more here.  Ah well."
0,"Avoid Avoid Avoid!\n\nEven if you live in Tempe, please drive the extra miles to your second closest Verizon location.\n\nI came into the store with issues transferring contacts from one smartphone to another after I was having issues with Backup Assistant.  I went during an off-period so I did not experience a long wait like most reviewers did.  But, I spent TWO HOURS in the store while associates failed to perform a simple contact transfer from the Backup Assistant/Cloud storage onto my phone.  I ended up leaving with the promise that a ticket had been created and the issue would be resolved shortly thereafter.  But , here I sit hours later and STILL no contacts on my phone.\n\nAfter two hours at home trying to figure it out and two hours in the store, I was very frustrated with my experience with Verizon and wanted to talk to the manager.  Carlos was a grade-A jerk and told me that backing up contacts was my responsibility, EVEN THOUGH I HAD CONTACTS ON MY OLD PHONE AND ON BACKUP ASSISTANT.  He said there was nothing he could do to help me since Backup Assistant is a free service, evidently ignoring the fact that I am a paying customer who just wasted half a day to not even get contacts put on my phone.\n\nCarlos and Co. have succumbed to the belief that they don't have to provide customer service at Verizon.\n\nCAUTION IS ADVISED!"
1,"This Borders closes very early compared to other stores and is always low on stock.  You can never find anybody to help you find something, but the line is short and the clearance section is nice.  The bathrooms are so-so.  The music selection is great and so are the DVDs."
0,"i have eaten at several chilis throughout the years and hadnt been to one in a while . my mother , son, and i went tonight and i was appauled at the whole experience. the service was slack no refills, smiles, or check backs, the food toook 45 minutes to come out~ i ordered an appetizer , my son got a kiddie meal, and my mother ordered two sides. when we asked to speak to the manager she took quite a while and showed up with our very late food and mentioned she heard we wanted to speak with us, dropped the food , and walked off without speaking with us. no one ever asked how it was ~ if they had we would have told them the order was wrong and overcooked and super greasy, trying to pay was anotehr 20 minute process. we WILL NEVER be back again. its rare in our busy schedules the 3 of us get to go out to eat together and was dissapointing to spend hard earned money on a horrible dinner"
0,"The bf got his truck washed here and raved about it!  He got an oil change, car wash, and leather treatment for his car.  It did look amazing when I saw it right after the wash.  I was impressed.\n\nSo, I went this past Friday to get my car washed. I got \""The Works\"" car wash.  I will say that the outside of my car did look fabulous when it was done.\n\nHere's where they went wrong:  First, IU was informed that my car was not shiny like it is supposed to be.  The guy compared my car to a freshly waxed black car.  Of course my silver car isn't going to look the same as a black car that just got waxed!  I was irritated to say the least.  Second: When my car was \""finished\"" I went over and got in.  As I started the car, and pulled away from the drying area, I realized the dash of my car was dusty.  It had never been wiped down.  What car wash vacuums a car but doesn't wipe off the dash?\n\nLooks like I'll be going back to Los Olivo's or Danny's for my future washes!"
2,"Being in the area I decided to have lunch here. It has been a while since we or I have been here. \n\nI am not sure if the same folks operate this place I did not recognise anyone. Yet they were friendly and quick to serve. I do not remember the TV in the corner. It might have always been here but never noticed it. I did today. there was a soap opera on, bad choice if you ask me as soap operas are nothing but moaning and groaning with a fair amount of fighting. Today some woman was screaming about losing her child. Not a happy subject for me. But even if they were showing something I would want to watch, I would not want to watch because I do not like TVs in restaurants. Soft music please...... \n\nI ordered pork egg foo yung. I do not know why since I never order pork. To me this version was very odd. I have always remembered sprouts being a part of this dish, one reason I like it. This was more like a turkey stuffing pattie, the consistency of it not the taste with pieces of pork on top and covered in a brown sauce. The actual taste was fine, but I just could not take the consistency so I left most of it. I still think the food here is just fine over all."
0,Beware of this gym!!! I put my membership on hold because of an injury and they said I still owe them money. I finally said OK and went into pay and canceled my account. I received an email for another bill that was still owe. They told me I didn't sign something. I said the employee never ask me to sign something. Oh well they are very unwilling to work with someone and are very RUDE!!!! I will tell as many people as I know to never use Lifetime because there service lacks any kind of common sense.
3,"This unlikely little club is considered to be one of the best places in the Valley to catch local bands. It's hard to believe this place is in sleepy Mesa!\n\nThe food is good and the selection is HUGE: Pizza, Calzones, sandwiches, Gyros, subs, burgers, steaks, and Mexican food. Watch out though-- cheap drinks and live music can make this place a madhouse!"
3,"Came for dinner before a 9:30 show at the Mirage. We were seated at 6:30. Our drinks were a little slow, arriving after our meatball. I had asked the meatball to be brought at the same time as our entrees but, it was brought as an appetizer. It was so freaking delicious, I didn't even care. I will return a hundred times for the meatball if not for anything else. The complimentary bread & sauce was very good. I ordered spaghetti with tomato & basil and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband ordered chicken mushroom ravioli. Not so great. It had an odd brown gel-like sauce. It was not at all what my husband was expecting and it was a really small portion. He ordered an extra order of the bread ($6) because he wasn't full. Our service was ok. Drinks went empty and never were refilled, so we drank water. The GM came around and was very nice. Even more so when we told him we were locals. Then we ordered dessert and it took 30+ minutes for it to arrive. We had to pick up our show tickets 1 hour before the show and we barely made it! The waiter was apologetic about the long wait & finally offered to refill our drinks at that point. The zeppole Oreos were delicious, just not sure why it took so long. Had we not had the show to get to, I would not have minded as the people watching was fabulous. Overall the giant Meatball was the star of this dinner. Can't wait for the weather to cool down to enjoy the patio seating. A little expensive ($125w/tip) for a pasta dinner, but it wasn't shocking. It was expected."
3,"What a store! I've never actually been in a Fry's until the other day and they have EVERYTHING! Books, music, video games, washing machines, tvs, everything. It's like the Walmart version of Best Buy."
3,"Our group of  6 came here on a Saturday night without making reservations so the wait was about 30 minutes for a table which wasn't too bad considering the place was really packed.  \n\nOur server was very attentive, as soon as we got seated  we ordered a couple pitchers of Sangria to start off with. The Sangria was good but it wasn't very strong.  while we waited they brought us a plate of bread with butter and some olives. We ordered about 5 or 6 plates off the menu to try.  We only waited about 20 minutes for the food to come out, was very impressed with how smoothly everything ran.  \n\nNow for the food, everything I tried was delicious! I ordered the manchego mac n' cheese which was a pretty small plate but it really delivered.  The paella was looking tempting and I immediately had to have more after a few bites of that.  I think the best thing I tried was the lamb, very tasty and it was so tender,   I feel like that was cooked to perfection.  I was very full after all of that but as Louis C.K. once said \""I don't stop eating when I'm full, I stop eating when I hate myself\"" so the group was in full agreement we needed some desert to top the great meal off and someone was craving the nutella sandwiches so we ordered that and I'm glad we did. The bread was fluffy but  was also heated so it had a little crunch on the outside that I really loved and then you add on the smoothness of the nutella and you have me saying \""I think my mouth is having an orgasm\"" \n\nThe bill actually wasn't that large for everything we ordered, it's perfect for a small group or date. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that comes out to Vegas"
4,"Brusco's does a great job of delivering very solid pizzas with a nice selection of Italian dishes.  I've eaten here three times and never been disappointed in either the food or service. Last time, I took a Brooklyn native with me who said it was a damn good pizza and especially liked the crust. The service staff has always been very friendly and quick. \n\nIt should be noted the place opened up in June, so a previous post complaining about the service should have taken into account the staff was still in a learning stage. That being said, I've never had an issue with the service."
3,"This restaurant was suggested to me by a friend.  \n\nWe were seated half way between the outdoor patio and the interior.  The restaurant is sexy and dark....hard to read your menu dark, but that's ok.  The vibe is lounge, with an extraordinary wine list.\n\nEverything on the menu looks amazing.  It was hard to choose, but we finally settled on the sausage flatbread, pesto cream pasta and the hamachi.  All were incredible, flavorful and fresh.  I was surprised how spicy and perfect the flatbread was, only because pizza crust can be tricky at a restaurant that isn't really a pizza place.\n\nWe skipped dessert, so I can't comment on that.\n\nService started great.  As the night went on, the server became more absent and we finally had to stop a random waiter to get the check.\n\nI plan on coming back.  For drinks or dinner, it's a great place to go with a group or a date."
3,"Whenever I'm in the mood for a good, solid burger I head over to Zinburger at Biltmore Fashion Park. I like how simple the menu is so it is not too overwhelming, yet there is something for everyone. I am a little obsessed with their zucchini fries, although I do wish they came out with my burger instead of before. The burgers are always good and they're big enough to share if you're not too hungry. I always say I'm going to try one of their shakes or pies for dessert, but I'm always too full from the burger and fries. Maybe next time. :)"
2,"I'm doing the local tourist review today. I haven't stayed at the hotel, so DON'T READ if that's what you're looking for.\n\nGoing to Vegas? Yeah, you're gunna want to watch water dancing to music, 1 Star.\n\nThat garden thingy? Oh yeah, it's the picturesque place.. if you could have the place to yourself. 2 Stars.\n\nThe big chocolate fountain?

3,"flew into and out of McCarran last week. no hassles or problems whatsoever.\n\nshuttle service to our hotel was handled quickly (TI doesn't have its own, but there are small buses that will do it for a small fee).\n\nwell, aside a slight security issue when a corkscrew/bottle-opener/knife inexplicably turned up in my friend's luggage, but that's a story for another time. we're still trying to piece together the previous night..."
0,"I ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom pizza for carry out. It was done on time, however, they used canned mushrooms and ruined a promising pizza. The pizza also had a salty taste, was very dry and cost $14.21, which is the most I've paid for a 2-topping medium pizza in a long time. And good luck getting any menu info on the web-site. Click on appetizers and it brings up salads. No prices are listed and no pictures of the food except cover-shots on the hone page.\n\nI had a bad feeling about it when I placed my order and I couldn't understand the person on the phone. It sounded like they answered saying 'hello' and I had to confirm this was Palermo's Pizza. I told them what I wanted and they said 'ok bye' and then realized they hadn't got my phone number and asked for it. Then said 'ok bye' again without telling me how long it would take. So I asked 20-30 minutes? They said 'yes. ok bye.'\n\nI figured it must have been busy. I went in to pick up my pizza and there were only 4 customers in the place with 2 visible employees. \n\nIts ironic that I paid extra for an added topping (mushrooms) that not only cost me more, but ruined the pizza. Whatever amount of money they are saving using canned ingredients instead of fresh, they just lost 100x fold in my future business. I'll be looking elsewhere for a true New York style pizza. This isn't it."
4,"So cool! Great space! Super stylish! Guy who slings the brew really seems passionate about his craft. I'm serious about my Iced Americanos, and Lo-Fi did *not* disappoint!  My only gripe is that they do not have decaf, however the owner did have a good reason.. he just can't seem to find decaf worth serving.. I'm really glad to have something this cool and stylin' in Downtown Mesa... worth a trip just to check it out! :3"
0,"Worst manicure I've had in years. He filed all my nails short without asking me. The polish was all over my skin around my nails and cuticles and, because it was red, it stained my skin. Do not recommend."
3,"Charming little cafe with a unique and delicious menu item- crepes. I love the sweet crepes and I always order the stawberry with nutella crepe. The coffees are delicious too. I have been here about 6 times recently and while the staff are very friendly, it seems they are always short 1-2 people during the mornings and weekends. Typical wait time for me when I dine alone is about 30-40 minutes. Just be prepared for that, enjoy a coffee and the atmosphere."
0,"I have been contemplating my \""cheat meal\"" all week and wanted none other than Pink Box. Well I was extremely disappointed with not only their selection but their entire set up, decor, ambiance and service. I felt like I walked into a 10x10 closet with an awkwardly unhelpful employee. Besides the lack of aesthetics, there were hardly any specialty donuts! Their selection was dismal and disappointing. I was not going to pay for an over priced glazed donut that I could get anywhere else. I have tried the Fat Elvis donut before and it was amazing. However unavailable at this location along with any of the other specialty donuts I wanted to try. Needless to say I left empty handed. If you plan on being open for extended hours or 24/7 like the other locations than I suggest having something worth choosing from."
4,"Yay! I heart Pet Club.\n\nThey are the closest place to south Scottsdale for horse tack and supplies (other than Tempe Feed, who I'm not fond of). Half the store is horse stuff: decent selection of bridles and bits, halters and LOTS of grooming supplies, treats, food, supplements, etc. You not only get a diverse selection of things, but also every size imaginable of each product: they carried 5 different sizes of Leather New.  Decisions, decisions for sure!\n\nThe rest is dog and cat stuff and holy crap, do they have a huge selection of toys. I stayed far away from those aisles because I knew I'd spend too much with the many choices. There were also a couple aisles devoted solely to high quality dog food (Innova, Blue Buffalo, Castor and Pollux, etc.)\n\nThe girl working was really nice and loved on my dog, and even held his wiggly butt for me while I looked at a halter. He got puppy treats on his way out as well :)\n\nWe'll be back!\n\nPS: You might miss it if you're not looking for it, especially if coming from the west; the building is kind of unremarkable. It's on the northeast corner of Main and Country Club."

4,"i am in love with this place! i found Laughing Buddah through Groupon. it is one of the best discoveries i've ever made! i love it here. as soon as you walk into the yoga studio, there is such a strong positive light and energy. it is one of the very few places i can go and feel \""home.\""\n\ndusty, the owner, is such an amazing person. she always has a smile and a kind word and is genuinely happy that you're there. the other instructors' classes are great, but i gravitate more to her energy and feel a stronger peace during her classes.\n\ni've been practicing yoga for about 7 years now and Laughing Buddah is by far my favorite. so far i've invited my fiance and aunt to a few classes and they love it. i will be taking one of my good friends this weekend for her first class. i highly recommend it to everyone."
4,"As always, awesome. A great In-N-Out location, perfect food for a great price. It's busy as you might think an In-N-Out might be in Vegas. Really busy. Did I say it was busy? But it's worth the ten minute wait inside. I think drive through might be faster, it depends."
1,"Well I came here after a Pirate's game since its just down the block from the stadium. I was not impressed at all. The staff basically walked around like zombies. My water had some gross soapy stain on it, at least that is what I hope it was. My food lacked any care in it being made. I just didn't feel as though we were really wanted there. I wish I just sat at the bar, since the bartender seemed to have more life to him than his server counterparts. Maybe next time I'll go before the game with there might be more life in the staff."
0,"Thought I'd give this place one last chance.... as my last two visits was a nightmare.  thought the drive through pulled in 5:50 pm no one in front. Speaker garbled words placed order after several repeats. 6:pm lady took money at window.........6:05 turned off engine........6:35 cars backing up behind me  finally food delivered.   pulled to parking space  No tarter sauce for fish, no napkin, no straw for drink, no dressing for salad.... went to inside to get forgotten items......food was warm but not hot.  the crew walking around in a daze like asked three time for items another 15 minutes....I could have driven to the other D's in Pineville or Monroe for the time Spent here to get warm food and no service"
3,"Funny how you can live in a city for so long and still find new activities. Every year the Cactus Garden is decorated with Christmas lights. A stroll around the small maze of cacti will take no more than 30 minutes. \n\nWhere other cities have to deal with snow and evergreen trees, we have decked out cacti and palm trees. It comes off as odd initially, but it is a beautiful display. \n\nThe parking is atrocious and it is only going to get worse. The store is jammed pack with visitors. The facility is immaculate for the traffic that comes in and out."
3,"Talking about Smoke's in a Montreal context is weird.\n\nEverywhere else in Canada, Smoke's is more or less the only game in town when it comes to poutine. What they mostly offer is a kind of stunt poutine that you can also find in the wilder sections of La Banquise's menu, but in massive, 'roided-out form. Theirs are nothing like the poutines you get at chipstands and most other greasy spoons in Quebec, which are a lot more minimalistic in their construction; fries, cheese curds, gravy, period. Almost every item on Smoke's menu will challenge your stomach to an epic wrestling match with the sheer volume of stuff they put in it.\n\nObviously, there's trad poutine on the menu, but there are literally hundreds of other places you can get decent-to-transcendent trad poutine in the city. Smoke's is not one of them. However, if you're in the mood for some laugh-in-the-face-of-death hot-rodded stunt poutine, go nuts. Their triple pork poutine is artery-clogging goodness at it's finest.\n\nSo get a tenner and laugh in the face of God for a spell while an awesome soundtrack of 80s detritus plays on the PA. Good times."
2,"Went here on a sat night around 9. Place was not crowded, cool vibe though, nice and dark with comfortable booths and a wall of plasma tv's. \n\nBeer list was pretty short and disappointing but ordered a Four Peaks Kilt lifter.  \nBurger list was pretty interesting but I ended up ordering the peppercorn burger and my wife ordered the sweet and spicy burger and split an order of half and half fries. The burgers were massive but the peppercorn burger was pretty plain, nothing to write home about, and not that tasty considering the price ($10). My wife's burger was great and way better than my burger. It has some sort of tempura on the burger with loads of sweet chili and was delicious. I guess the extra $2 bucks I spent on this burger made all the difference.\n\nAll in all the place is great to chill out have a beer, watch some tv, and grab a decent burger. Place though was over priced. 2 burgers, 1 beer, and 1 order of fries will set you back 40 bucks with tip. For 40 bucks I would rather go grab a steak and a beer. Not sure how long this place will last at this price especially for burgers."
2,"It is another fast food place one can get a burger. I do not understand the overly zealous like for the food. Yes the inside of the store is nice and clean and the employees are actually smiling and understand the menu, but considering the limited choices on the menu I guess this is not truly an amazing feat.  But nice just the same. The burgers and fries are ok, nothing to rave about. I did discover that they should be eaten there as these items do not travel well. By the time we got ours home they were just yucky."
2,"Decent burgers, really friendly service, and a very basic, straightforward menu.     I was interested in trying this place out after reading all the rave reviews from all over the country so when it finally opened up in Phoenix, I decided to give it a shot.         The burgers are definitely good, done very well, the fries are great tasting too and they give you A LOT of them, if you go and order the \""large fries\"" you're going to find a whole paper sack absolutely filled to the brim with them.          \n\n\n  All in all, Five Guys is a nice place to grab a quick lunch, a little bit on the pricy end for fast food but there is a difference in quality between this place and the McBurgerBarns out there, that's for sure."
4,"LOVE Pure Body Fitness Studio!! It's a unique group exercise fitness facility with so much to offer! Each room is dedicated to specific work outs. \n\n1. TRX room\n2. Boot camp\n3. Yoga \n4. Cycling\n5. Pilates\n6. Barre\n7. And all the amazing les mills classes!\n-BodyPump, CXWORX, Body Attack, BodyStep, Body Flow.\n\nCLEAN Facility, fab locker rooms, and awesome staff!! \n\nTwo thumbs up for PB fitness! :-)"
1,The service was good but I can't say the same about the food.  My food was super greasy and it just did not taste good.  The prices are kind of high too.
2,"Treated aunt to a belated birthday dinner (three other adults and two children dining; I only had a cocktail and two teensy flakes off of the top of a cheddar biscuit.  BE AWARE that EACH biscuit contains 8 grams of fat, 2.5 grams saturated, and a total of 150 calories.  \n\nThey ordered *Berry-Mango daiquiris http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg#d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg and I a *classic mojito. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA#iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA  I heard that the berry-mango was a balanced mixture of fruit flavors, but the alcohol was hardly-detectable.  The alcohol flavor wasn't missed at all, though.  Everyone who had them \""ooh\""ed and \""ahh\""ed.  I wished a simple mango version was available, but I'm also glad it wasn't, or else I would never have found out that RL, or more specifically the bartender working that shift, served a TERRIFIC mojito!  My first sip disappointed, but once I swirled everything a few times with the straw, the drink actually turned out to be one of the best mojitos I've ever had!  It's a classic version, made with Bacardi Superior rum, muddled mint, pure cane sugar (don't like ones made with simple syrup-- too sweet), freshly-squeezed lime juice, and club soda.\n\nI would never be able to dine here (aversion to farm-raised fish, intolerance/allergy to whitefish, shellfish allergies, and Blue Bunny ice cream choices contain corn syrup), but I wouldn't mind enjoying a mojito while everyone else dines!  :)\n\n*Berry-mango daiquiri = 350 calories\n*Mojito = 190 calories"
4,"I hereby declare my love for Mini Quesadillas, and everything else they offer here. Great food"
4,"Karla is absolutely the BEST hairdresser in town!  She is personable and attentive while in her chair.  As owner of the salon, she cares about her staff and ensures they are all learning new techniques and styles often.  The salon is ecclectic and fun and always very clean!  And being right beside The Common Market is just an added bonus!!"
3,"Please don't hate, but I like Chipotle... Sure it's owned by McDonalds, sure it's not authentic Mexican food, but still it's very tasty. Nothing special about this particular location: it looks like any other Chipotle restaurant (maybe a little nicer?). The nice thing about it, though, is that I get the same burrito that I would buy in NYC for $2 cheaper..."
1,"We have ordered a pizza and waited long time. But at the end, they gave us a hoagie... The lady there promised to refund us, but we never received it."
3,"I would highly recommend this place over any Denny's or IHOP. The food is much better in quality, while being comparable in price range to other diners.\n\nWe were seated very quickly, and the waitresses were tentative and kind.\n\nGreat for large parties, and for anyone who needs some standard, fill-you-up breakfast or brunch!"
0,"Ordered the Sampler with mini-burros and flautas for $9.45. It was, by far, the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten. The flautas were about the diameter of pencils and way over-cooked, and the burros were just four fried balls of dough one with very dry beef, the second with a tiny amount of beans, the third with cheese and a single slice of chili, and the fourth with chicken. No sauce - just the little fried balls of dough. When I asked for some sour cream, I was told that would be another $1.12.. I suggest Taco Bell over this sad excuse for a Mexican restaurant."
4,"Was in today for 4 new tires for my truck.  Made an appointment online, and was glad I did.  There was a line outside the store before they opened (appointment was for 8am).  They opened a few minutes early instead of making us wait outside, and Kyle came outside and greeted me BY NAME.  He knew who I was because I put in my vehicle information on the reservation, VERY IMPRESSIVE.  Seemed like my truck was on the lift BEFORE I had even finished paying.  I was out the door in no time.  Loyal customer for life.  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Thanks guys!"
3,I really like this club gay friendly and ppl are 2 :DDD
4,"Wow, my first time going to a Gucci store where I didn't get irritated at all.  Our sales associate was awesome!  So friendly and helpful.  We were buying a purse for our friend's birthday, but weren't sure which to get.  So we were taking pictures of different purses (which is normally a major no-no) and texting her.\n\nThe guy was super helpful and got us in and out fairly quickly (once we FINALLY picked a purse).  He even wrapped it all nice and pretty for us :)"
4,"Bertha's is seriously amazing. \n\nPerfect sandwiches and salads. And those delicious cookies that come with the lunch specials are to die for! Whenever I'm in the area, I stop by here. This place is a must. I just wish they had longer hours of operation for their business....seemingly because it's very popular (and with good reason!). If you're looking for a sandwich or salad in the area, look no further as Bertha's is completely solid and fresh."
0,I have been going to glad nails for over 5 years now and usually had a ok- great pedi depending on the nail tec. Last month I received horrible service and pedi. It was done by one of the male tecs. He performed the wrong pedi and told me that I could not change to the sea salt one because he already put lotion on my leg. Then he put the wrong color on. No tip and never will be back. Just found a new nail salon on Happy Valley Rd.  They are awesome and use hot rocks in their pedi service.
3,Love the place! Great food and atmosphere. All the employee looked like they were having a great time.\nWonderful staff! I forgot and left my wallet there and they found it and\ntook care of it till I could return to get it. THANKS SO MUCH!
3,"Finally got to experience the awesomeness that is The Roosevelt Tavern!! it's in this historic house right on 3rd st just North of Roosevelt. WE ended up getting a few great beers from their awesome beer menu, and this super great cheese plate. it has this fantastic sheep's milk cheese, some other type of smoked cheese, aged cheddar, marcona almonds, cranberries, honey and this amazing bread from this local bakery. Just an awesome place, can't wait to  go back!!"
3,"Outstanding food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. They get very busy and don't take reservations but they make up for that having an advanced automated txting system which allows you to do anything within 10 mins, once they txt you that it's time to be seated, you have 10mins to show up."
1,"Rolled on over to Body English for after hours after starting my night at Lavo.  I sorta/kinda remember getting to the Hard Rock...not much of a line around 2:30ish but we were on a guest list and no problems getting in.  Stopped at the bar upstairs to buy my ladies a round of drinks...$50 for 4 drinks...not surprised, and actually not too bad.  I once paid $22 for a redbull/vodka in Vegas. *&^*$(**&%#*!!?!??!!\n\nOnce again, a million and one stairs to get downstairs. This is the worst idea ever when ladies in heels are involved.\n\nThe dance floor was small, not crowded, but fun.  You knew that the people here were all pretty much wasted, but ready to keep the party going.  (I usually end up at Drai's for my afterhours, but since it's temporarily closed...)  The DJ was...eh.  Trust me, I love my EDM, and will be back for EDC in Vegas, but this was straight too much techno for me.  The untse untse's never changed.  It gets too repetitive for me.\n\nSo I wandered over to the downstairs bar for another drink, and my experience here is what really left a bad taste in my mouth.  Facing the bar I was on the far left side.  The female waitress straight ignored me for a good 5-7 minutes, serving all of the men around me.  I am a patient bar fly, waiting my turn and not hounding the bartenders.  But when my whole side of the bar was empty, and she decided to hug and chat with her male friend that stopped by, even looking at my and obviously deciding she didn't want to serve me,  I had had enough.  Marched right on down to the other female bartender who was hustling to serve folks, and had a drink within a minute.  I told her she was doing an excellent job and that her coworker was a lazy, rude b*tch, and she just shook her head in silent agreement.  I would rather brave the stairs and go back to the upstairs bar than give that stupid a$$ my money.  At the end I hoped she would serve me so that I could give her a big fat ZERO tip.\n\nBody English...get your bartenders in check.  I have never been treated so rudely in Vegas.  Will I be back? Not unless I'm dragged.\n\nBonus: after hours.\nBogus: rudest bartender ever."
2,"Been wanting to check out a Thai place other than Lotus of Siam (you know, just to see what's out there - I could eat LOS daily)\n\nAnyway, the place has character!  It's in a tough area but once you get inside it is very comfortable and quaint.  The server and manager were both so nice and friendly.  \n\nWent for an early dinner around 6:00pm and was surprised we were NOT the only people there considering the location (also BTW you can't turn south onto 3rd from Charleston because of some road repairs).  In fact, by the time we left more than half the tables were occupied (on a Tuesday, no conventions in town).  Also saw multiple customers come in for takeout.  \n\nBBQ Chicken - this is the house specialty and it was solid, although the only thing that really made it Thai was the sweet-tangy sauce they served it with.  Be sure to eat it all while it's hot - there was a piece of chicken left at the end of the meal which had gotten cold and I ate - defintely better hot!\n\nBBQ Pork -  Also solid and also couldn't tell they were \""Thai\"" except for the sauce.\n\nPineapple fried rice - This was very well executed.  Some places add too much curry spice but this was not the case here.\n\nDrunken Noodle with Shrimp - Extra spicy, \""9/10 Thai Spicy not American Spicy please\"" - Even with all that request it was still not superhot.  However, it had a decent amount of heat and the dish was phenomenal.  I enjoyed this dish so much that I placed an extra order to-go for lunch next day \""just a leeeeetle bit more spicy please!\""\n\nI wouldn't make the trip to downtown just to dine here but if in the area I would go back, especially if I was in the mood for BBQ.  Apparently there are two other locations, but a friend told me that this is the best location of the three.\n\nAlso, I thought this place super cheap.  The four entrees mentioned above were $45 with tip."
0,"Possibly one of the worst sushi restaurant's I've ever been to. A small group of friends and I went in and asked to sit at the bar. Well, actually we put our names on a piece of paper. No greeting from the employees, just a silent, wait your turn kind of atmosphere. We knew we probably wouldn't sit together (the restaurant is VERY small and they only utilize half the space), but we figured maybe a spot would open up. We sat down to wait and a party of three walked in. They were seated almost immediately. We tried to ask the waiters what had happened, but they put their hands up repeatedly and continued as they were. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited our turn.\n\n20 minutes later two parties got up from their seats leaving six bar seats open in a row. We were so happy! We promptly stood up knowing that we'd be seated next. The owners then seated a party of two that had come in after us in the spots that should have gone to us. We asked to speak to the manager who explained to us that they don't seat \""large parties\"" at the bar. We reminded her that we were totally okay with being separated, but she stuck to her ridiculous rule of not seating us.\n\nSo here we are, 25 minutes later with no communication letting us know that we were waiting to sit at a table. We asked them to seat us in groups of 2 or individually and the owner continued to explain that we were not welcome at the bar due to our party's size despite that we would all be paying individually. At this point she became hateful and manipulative. She crossed our name off of the top of the hand written list and added our names underneath all of the parties that came in after us. We were so upset that we up and left. We received no customer service (or even interaction) and were treated like an annoyance. If you want to give your money to an entirely rude and spiteful establishment for the sake of a gimmick, go right ahead but I will never be returning."
4,"Okay, guestline/regular line is a pain. There's people in line even at 3:00 am. This place is the hottest club. Three floor, hip hop room, lounge w/ pool table, and main dance floor that's connected to the outside pool area. The crowd used to be full of prettier people when it first open, now it's a mixed. For girls, there are ways to get in for free. Do know that if you get there at 10 pm, you can expect to be in line for 2 hr and 1+ hr waiting in front because the way they make money is making you either pay extra to get in since you're at the front or leave. You'll still have an awesome time at this place. \nDaypool - It is fun. They've got the music and again, being a girl is awesome. Good looking crowd. Pretty happening place."
3,"One dear friend calls this place \""Whole Paycheck\"" and it does add up quite a bit. Like Kermit says though  \""it's not easy being green\"".\n\nHowever, I do appreciate any business that is willing to be different and to provide a better way of living- give them plenty of kudos simply for that fact. It's not only food, some people don't know WF has a foundation that helps projects that life communities out of poverty, or a Local Producer Loan Program that gives low interest loans to small productions, or support wind and solar power farms to offset 100% of their electrical usage.\n\nFor someone who has food allergies, this place is their savior. For some, it is wholesome foods they can make a change with and I'm rooting for anyone who wants to live consciously.  For people like me though, I come for select things since I can't afford to go fully microbiotic/organic, but I like to keep my home and foods as natural as possible. Going all natural in a world like today, specially in a city like Vegas isn't so easy. It's not like back home where LA has an abundance of big farmers markets and natural food stores to chose from. \n\nFirstly, toothpaste. This is the only place that carries Jason products and their Sea Fresh is the only toothpaste I use. I will not put any other toxic brand in my mouth. Never ever again. I love that they have a variety of natural products and I tend to buy things like shampoo here when I can't get to places like Lush.\n\nI buy mostly from the produce section. It's fresh, it's not too badly priced considering its natural and I find things here I have difficulty finding anywhere else- gold beets, chanterelle mushrooms, brussel sprouts fresh on the stalk, heirloom mini tomatoes,etc.\n\nTheir beer selection isn't wide, but it makes up for in selections. Often times when I am looking for a limited edition, I can find it here. In particular- Dechutes limited like Abyss and Jubel are often available.\n\nDeli is okay. I do love WF deli but this one compared to the Cali ones  and even the other Vegas branches has the most limited selection of the ones I've been in. It's still good quality, just sometimes I'm looking for a particular WF deli item I'm hankering for and this one does not have it. There's this quinoa salad I loved in La Jolla and I've seen it only at the LVB store. I also like their spicy soba noodles, rotisserie chicken and curry salad. \n\nEverything else is hit and miss. Some dry goods, breads, meats, cheeses, etc. I can find cheaper at other natural markets so it's about buying what is a reasonable deal here or getting things here that I cannot find elsewhere (black forest bacon for example). .  Check out the under $3 basket of cheese! I think this is great for a small dinner party since you can sample a load of cheeses that normally come in big $10+ hunks. \n\nAny serious and honest cook can't really denounce a place like this. For the their selection and a honorable mission I am a fan, even when it hurts my wallet."
2,"This bar is pretty awesome for the Las Vegas locals. They have themed night and such. Came here on a Monday the place was really packed with lots of girls!! Drinks are averagely priced if its not happy hour, but you can still spend alot if you leave your tab open and your sister keeps ordering drinks for other people!! Lol. They also have hookah here which is awesome. Nice bathrooms cant complain, the inside is pretty nice and the outside has good seating. Its in Town square which has a lot of nice stores and you can come here and relax after you've been shopping. Definitely recommend for locals and the wondering tourists."
2,"Hmmm, go for happy hour and get the appetizers.  Watch the time, too, because if you dont get your drink order in....they won't honor it.  \n\nI was close at getting my last drink, but the rest of my party was denied.  Bartender said Verizon time and we all had Verizon phones, so we looked.  It was 12 min before the hour. I had asked for a drink TWICE already so I got mine, but the others were S.O.L.  We still had more and then closed out the tab and proceeded on to the dining area for $350.00.\n\nOysters were YUM, bread was good, main meal was just ok.  Atmosphere is amazing with the unicorn fish, especially.  Honestly, I would rather go back to Triple Sevens Brewery at Main Street Station though for more Pumpkin Ale and good sandwiches.  Anyhow....  It's vegas so you are paying high dollar for mediocre food.  It's just what it is.  Enjoy!!!\n\nDidnt get to try a desert, but they looked fab!"
3,"Only been one time, but it's safe to say I had an above average experience! I ordered the half pound Jalape\u00f1o Jack burger with a side of onion rings. The burger entailed a perfect spice, high quality meat (from Midwestern meats), and flavorful cheese. The onion rings were really great too! Decent portions here, I was definitely full. \nMy only problem is that my bill was $11 and change. A bit pricey for a no frills in and out styled place that caters to those who need a quick bite to eat after work or another event. I didn't even order a drink, mind you. Regardless it's but a minor set back in what was a really solid burger! I'd recommend it to others."
3,"I finally made it to Culinary dropout after hearing so many wonderful raves about the place.  Came here with two others and a baby and we were seated immediately.  The decor is modern and funky and I loved the giant crystallized chandeliers.  I couldn't believe they had la fin du monde in bottle here; unibroue is one of my favorite breweries and I've never seen it available in restaurants before!  Kudos!  I decided on the fried chicken for my meal, and man it did not disappoint; skin on the outside was perfectly fried and the chicken was incredibly juicy.  They also lightly drizzly some sort of sweet sauce on top that makes the dish unique.  The sides were all tasty but not breath taking.  I tried my sister's pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun and that was also really tasty.  \n\nI will definitely come here again."
3,"All I have to say is... Grilled cheese and creamy tomato soup!!!! And excellent beer selection. I'm a fan of the Rogue Hazelnut (goes just right with the grilled cheese and soup).\n\nDimmed, relaxing lighting and awesome service!"
3,"I've been a member for about 3 months and so far so good.The massages are nice, they have aromatherapy available which is awesome, but you do have to remind them you want it. They place hot towels on you after your massage which is nice as well. If you are like me with horrible neck and shoulders I would definitely recommend Tara."
3,"Sticker. Sticker. Sticker.\n\nSticker shock when I saw the bill!\n\nThank goodness it wasn't my turn. Lol. \n\nEverything was good. It's in a decent location, to where they can change you premium solely for location, but it's definitely a delight. \n\nEverything was delicious. The service was exceptional. \n\nWould definitely dine again."
4,"***Review for nightclub***\n\nI LOVE MARQUEE!\n\nI LOVE MARQUEE!!\n\nI LOVE MARQUEE!!!\n\nOk I'm done being annoying now. But one more time I LOVE MARQUEE! I've been here about 6 times and each time was a blast!\n\nI love the fact that there are 3 different levels and each level plays different types of music. Sure there are stairs, but you have two options: use the elevator or walk up/down the stairs slowly while holding on to the railing lol. \n\nI'm usually downstairs in the Boom Box Room and yes it's small but the music is usually on point! I also like the Main Room and The Library too.\n\nThe pool area is nice especially when you need some fresh air after dancing.  \n\nDrinks are typical Vegas prices meaning they are overpriced! \n\nThe question isn't IF I will be back it's WHEN will I be back...soon hopefully : )"
3,"I have seen every single performer who has fronted this show, from really good to really bad but last night with Coco was the BEST.\n\nMel B. & ??? was awesome way back in the day when the show opened (but what do you expect with people who can SING & DANCE??).\n\nHolly Madison was absolutely horrible. Might as well have taped a spot on the stage for her to stand because she had no idea what was going on. Sister looked like she was lost!\n\nAngel Porrino! What a DOLL, way better (as in more enthusiastic about the 8 minutes on stage) than Holly was and way better to look at too. I hope we continue to see her around Vegas for awhile.\n\nCoCo last night owned it! Thank god they put someone in the show again who could dance. Shake that big booty girl!!! I hope eventually they change more of the show (they changed it a little between Holly & Coco) so we have more Coco dancing."
1,"I came to this place because a family friend was in town and enjoyed it wanted to go back for a second time in the same week. It seems like a cool concept, but I did not like certain things. I think while it is a fun idea to \""make your own dish\"" it didn't make for a nice dinner. It made it feel fast food-ish. Not somewhere I'd want to go on a date. The whole getting food process wasn't as fun as it should've been either lots of waiting so conversation time was definitely lost. If you know how to make Mongolian I'd say go ahead try it if not, go somewhere the prepare the dishes for you."
2,"Refreshing adult milk shakes?!  Sign me up!\n\nMy friends and I checked this place out right after it opened.  The lure of ice cream and alcohol on a warm afternoon was too enticing.  In keeping in line with Old Town, this place isn't very big, but there's tons of seating and booths.  The DJ was playing a funky retro mix, and the overall vibe was good.\n\nService, however, was not good.  It took an hour to get 3 milkshakes and 6 glasses of water, and we had to ask for the water 3 times.  I don't get what's up with people and water in this state...seriously, this is the desert.  People need to hydrate.  I even tip for water....just bring me a glass, don't make me keep asking.  \n\nNeedless to say, we decided not to stay.  Although the drinks were good, the service was way too slow.  Next time I think I'll try a weekday...maybe that will be better."
4,"Eating at this restaurant was not just a meal but an experience. The food was awesome. We had the special soup, escargot, and the steak frites. The steaks were perfectly cooked. The service was spectacular. Our server, Michelle was a true professional. She made perfect recommendations and was on the spot with everything. We had the chocolate tart and the bread pudding for dessert. Awesome! Sitting on the patio with a view of the Bellagio fountains was just the icing. We will definitely be back!"
4,"My wife and I heard many good things about Mesa Grill, so we decided to give it a try.  We went in around noon for lunch on a Thursday and the restaurant was pretty empty.  The waiter promptly told us the specials and asked if we know who Bobby Flay is.  It seems like they are trained to talk about the Iron Chef.\n\nWe ordered the SHRIMP + ROASTED GARLIC CORN TAMALE for appetizer, ANCHO CHILE-HONEY GLAZED SALMON, and GREEN CHILE BURGER for entrees.\n\nSince Bobby Flay is known for his sauces, the tamale came with a very creamy garlic sauce that complements the entire dish.  For the salmon, it came with a light black bean, bbq, and honey sauce.  Also, it is topped with fresh green salsa that refreshes the palate with every bite.  My wife stated that it was the best salmon she's ever had.  The green chile burger is also very interesting.  The sour component that usually comes from ketchup is replaced with green chile instead.  The patty is also very tasty and moist.\n\nOverall, we really enjoy the food and the service at Mesa Grill.  We will definitely visit it again when we come back to Las Vegas."
2,"I love Hobby Lobby for all things hobby, and this location is especially great because it is humongous! \n\nI almost would have thought that I looked through the entire store if the item I was looking for didn't happen to be located in another wing, down the ramp to the left. \n\nMy only problem with this mega layout is that it's quite different than the others, so I didn't automatically know my way around. Also, I was looking for satin ribbon and a hair flower and instead of having all the ribbons and flowers in one central location they were scattered in many different spots throughout. Because of this I had to literally walk every aisle, which on this particular day didn't suck, but it would have in the event I had somewhere to be. \n\nOverall, I love this chain and never fail to find what I'm looking for.  Often I even find a lot of things that I didn't know I was looking for, due to their very expansive and ever changing selection. They are closed on Sundays, which can be inconvenient at times, but then I remind myself how awesome/rare it is to find a company that places their values over profit, and ultimately it makes me like them that much more. Keep an eye out for their frequently offered coupons for additional savings. Really can't go wrong here."
0,I have used this laundromat for about 2 yrs now. The ladies whenever there is someone there are nice (if they're not on their cell phones talking away).... Then a couple of weeks ago I went in for the last time as I finally moved out of that area (Thank goodness)... Now I'm trying to call their customer service number and all you get is a damn answering machine saying they'll call back in 24 hrs. Well it's been about 5 days n still no call back. You're expected to pay $.50 for the card you get and of course if you have a balance on it good luck trying to get your money back. Also now there's bums and drunks laying asleep on the benches and no one seems to go anything about it. I'm so glad I don't have yo deal with this anymore!!!!
0,"I think people give this place 4 or 5 stars because they WANT to like it, and want to feel worldly and cosmopolitan. My primary complaint with this place is that it is far too expensive for what it is. \n\nI ordered one of the chicken entrees, at $14.95, and it tasted fine- nothing special though, and I was still hungry after devouring it. So hungry that I went and had two slices at Ian's.  It was just one chicken breast with some sauce and a small patch of rice. It also came with a small bowl of soup, which was flavorless. This is not a fancy place- it's basically a cafeteria, which is fine by me, but why the fine dining prices and small portions? I'm amazed that people in Madison are willing to pay these prices for such small portions. I should say, also, that I very rarely leave a restaurant still hungry, so it's not like I have a super sized appetite."
4,The garlic chicken is awesome. And the pad Thai is about the best ever.  We checked out the reviews and was do happy we did.
3,"First time I've been here in five years and it didn't disappoint! There wasn't a lot of traffic on a Saturday which I liked... but based on the food it should have been packed! The chicken lettuce wraps were pretty good! The rest dishes were savory and well prepared (had the Kung Pao chicken and crispy orange beef). You can get white or brown rice. The crispy beef was still crispy and the orange sauce had a little bit of a kick to it... just the way I like it. \n\nThe service was nothing to write home about, but decent nonetheless. \n\nYou know its a good Chinese place when all the staff talks with a think accent :-)"
3,"Truly an amazing hotel.\nWe were lucky enough to get a 1 bedroom suite overlooking The Strip and it was gorgeous.\nThe hotel staff is incredibly friendly and professional\nAs mentioned already there's no casino and no smoking in the lobby.\n\nSo I'll go over some things that are fresh in my mind.\n\nPool - pretty standard rectangular pool, gets pretty crowded on Fridays and Saturdays but we (group of 4) were always able to find something when we went down (later in the afternoon/early evening).\nThe wait staff is very pleasant for service at the pool, only qualms is that it closes at 8 pm during the summer.\n\nValet is free but they do expect tips.  Not bad if it's a once in a while thing (especially if you're driving other people and will split it)\nOtherwise there is parking across the street.\n\nThe main lobby is generally open/not crowded.  Check in on Saturday took about 10 minutes, Check out on Monday took about the same time.\n\nThe 1 bedroom suite had a incredible bedroom with an incredible bathroom.  It had a spacious dual head shower and a incredibly large jacuzzi bathtub that was able to fit 2 small/medium adults comfortably.  The different jet settings were lovely.\n\nThere are 2 free shuttles from the hotel\nOne goes to the fashion mall which is nice if you want to go there (it saves you a 5-10 minute walk, but other than that seems somewhat odd)  \nThere's also a shuttle that goes further out, but it's only once an hour and we never seemed to be heading out when it was.\n\nThe suite had a full kitchen although we didn't really bring back anything to cook.\n\nOverall the hotel is incredibly relaxing and a nice \""vacation\"" from the Strip when you want it."
4,Excellent customer service and the guys there are nice to talk to and take time with you. The manager did get the apparel sizes I needed. They also installed new sights on my friends Glock at the same time. Same service at the Mesa store. One gentleman even showed me how to replace the slide plate with the special ones they sell. Not a big deal to do for him (and now not me--I've done 3).  I'll definitely visit next time I'm in Phoenix.
1,"We tried this twice since it was in our hotel... it was kind of ghetto and trashy and the people weren't very friendly (we were basically told we couldn't stand anywhere except the dancefloor). Nice music and free drinks some nights but otherwise not worth it, there are so many better clubs closeby!"
2,"I've been here a few times and for \""quick food\"" joint it isn't so bad! (Especially when option is noodles or Five Guys...)\n\nI really like that noodles & co. Has the calorie count clearly labeled on the menu and offer each dish in two sizes. I've ordered both the pasta rosa and Bangkok curry, two of the lower calorie options, and have enjoyed both. Both times I have been here I didn't have to pay for my meal which sways my opinion a bit. I always think these types of places are overpriced for what it is and noodles is no different.\n\nThe staff at this particular location are extremely friendly and efficient. Both times I have been here for lunch were busy but lines moved and dishes were brought out quickly.\n\nI usually do not like chains and would have never gone here on my own if I hadn't been in groups. All things aside, noodles is one of the few lunch chains I will oblige to going to and have yet to have a poor meal."
4,"Living in the Phoenix heat, there's hundreds of HVAC companies to chose from, so of course i went to yelp for a good company with integrity that stands out from the rest,  so Benefit was called. From the dispatcher Mack taking my work order, to the tech, chuck, i was happy, and felt no pressure."
4,"Love Chick-fil-A! Been a Raving Fan for almost 6 years. When it comes to customer service and atmosphere, it just doesn't get any better than Chick-fil-A. It's more than just a transaction, it's an experience. Great family environment and healthy choices."
0,"I came here with the bride about a month ago to model maid dresses for her.  We were largely ignored.  There was only one bride in the store, but apparently since she was spending more than us (presumably) we couldn't get any help.  We ended up getting other styles and colors ourselves.  The Bride had to do everything else.  We easily spent 2 hours there and while we SAW employees, we rarely interacted with any, and not for lack of trying on our parts.  It was a really unpleasant experience.  The bride should really have only had to sit there and look at what the dresses looked like, not do all the work!"
4,Very delicious food here
2,I came here with my girlfriend right before a preseason Angels game.  Needed to get some food in us because we were starving.\n\nThe place was clean like a franchise type of place usually is.  The sandwich was good and the lady helping us was very friendly and kinda funny.  Far better experience than hitting up ANY Subway.    I would go again and probably will next year before another preseason game.
4,Saw positive reviews for Sushi Avenue and decided to stop by and try Sushi Avenue.  The employees there are very nice and care about their customers.  The Food is the best!!  I had Octapus and fresh water eel sushi as well as their Teryaki Chicken plate.  I would deffinetly suggest going.
2,"Not super impressed. The food was just ok. My friends said the French toast was good, but my Goat cheese, tomato and mushroom omelette had maybe had an oz. of goat cheese. At 9$ it was a rip off. The potatoes were good,but nothing special. The mimosa was excellent, but made from Andre, so after consuming it I had a headache. The service was slow, but they were good about refilling my coffee and water. Just an ok experience."
2,"The place was a lot of fun because I was with a group of girls and comped drinks kept on coming to our table.\n\nThe service and staff were amazingly friendly.  Although I wasn't there for the food, it wasn't too bad.  In fact, I don't remember much of what I ordered but it was only from the appetizer menu. \n\nThe place does get really busy, so make sure you call for reservations."
3,i love this applebee's !!!! everyone is super friendly!  for dessert i recommend getting the blondie! so yummy
0,"The breakfast here is not so bad.  They do make some good omlets and pancakes, but then again, so does my 10 yr old niece.  Also, I'm relatively certain that their hash browns are little more than shredded paper, as the flavor is quite similar.  In most everything I've eaten there, a certain luster is lacking, and that luster is called flavor.\n\nLast night, we tried dinner and it turned out to be an overall horrible experience.  We were actually the first diners in, and were followed by a solitary gentleman about 10min later.  Despite the fact that he arrived after us, he received his food and we nearly through eating before we ever got ours.  Perhaps this was due to the fact that as soon as he arrived, the waitress spent 98% of her time chatting with him.  When the plates arrived, we were expecting to at least enjoy what we had, but sadly, this was not to happen.\n\nI ordered the Sunrise Steak Sandwich, and my girlfriend ordered the ground sirloin steak.  It was quite obvious to us both upon taking our first bites that the cook (I would not dare to call this person a chef) has no sense of how to properly season food.  Neither dish had any flavor whatsoever.  What a dissappointment, and it was truly upsetting to have spent my hard earned money on such complete rubish.  \n\nIt's my opinion that the only reason this place gets any good reviews results from the fact that the people of Maricopa are used to such an extremely low quality of dining to choose from, that the food at Sunrise actually tastes good to them.  It seems as if they've abandoned their God given right to something better.   Instead of reconstructing the restaurant, they should have reconstructed their recipes.  Where we are concerned, my girlfriend and I would prefer to make the drive out of Maricopa from now on."
1,"I have endured endless requests to prebooze (Crescent Ballroom is a short stumble away) and/or dine here by friends. From this day forward, I will refuse to. If possible, I will navigate their thirst or hunger in direction of any other surrounding restaurants. \n\nVig is the new kid in town. It's (blandly) remodeled but wants you to think it's hip and those heavy-prices across the menu are therefor worth it! \n\nThey are not. The food is mediocre and certainly not worth the cost. Signature drinks are weak. And that service has a standstill at below average across multiple visits. \n\nPull it together, Vig!"
1,"This hotel is okay in a pinch but I would not stay here longer than absolutely necessary. The room overall appeared clean but if you looked the carpet was dirty, the floor in the bathroom had cigarette burns as did the couch, which smelled and table was broken. The room was rather large with a small kitchenette. They have a pool which is small in size. They don't offer any ride services and it can be a walk, so be prepared for that. \n\nTheir breakfast was ummm small. They had packs of oatmeal and granola bars, there was no fruit and they only had one coffee when I got in. Needless to say it left me wanting more. \n\nBut what really made it special was that the screen to the room in the main window was bent back which made me think why would someone break in to their own room when they could just go get another key, so that means someone not allowed in wanted in. \n\nYeah this place is not the greatest but in a pinch, would do."
2,"i was both really impressed and really unimpressed when i went here the other day. ok, good before bad:\nthe atmosphere is awesome. so much industrial detail, it's perfect. and the menu is pretty interesting. caribbean burger? lobster mac and cheese?! and they have a pretty big list of beers on tap too. i personally had the caribbean burger which was pretty damn good (gotta add the lobster though!) and the chili which i was also impressed with. oh, and our waitress was so adorable and helpful!\nbut now, the bad:\ni also had the management burger (my \""date\"" and i split them both) and i was pretty disappointed. i mean, it wasn't bad by any means, just really bland. the description sounded so good so i was pretty caught off guard. i also had the industry copper ale and again, not bad, just really unimpressive. the prices were kind of ehh.. beer was about average, maybe a dollar more than a cheaper place, and the entrees were so-so. the burgers were priced well, but i had to hold off on the lobster mac and cheese because of price.\ni'd still definitely recommend the place, but don't get too excited and be disappointed!"
0,"Came here on a date. Food was awesome drinks rocked, server was awesome but the bartender was an asshole. \nThe girls drink came, stank like someone puked in it and there was bits floating around, the server smelled it and gave an odd look stating he will get another. For 10 minutes the server and bartender began conversing about the drink and the bartender sipped it till it was all gone. The server stated to the bartender he's starring at me just make another drink. He didn't. So I got up, threw the receipt book with $20 tip inside and walked out. He shouted Oh ill make you another, I replied, STICK IT.\nIn my opinion, the bartenders an asshole, failed to make another drink and when I was walking out the door offered. It doesn't take over 10 minutes to make a drink, especially when you finished the whole thing."
3,we went for brunch w/friends a couple of sundays ago i had the tasso ham benidict w/a small ramican of sausage gravey on the side (usually over the top) it was fabu the service is always great and lunches/dinners also great good beers on tap and good cocktails
0,"ok so steer clear of this place! 1st of all I've eaten there twice before coupls years ago and it was decent enough for my husband and I to decide to buy a \""voucher\"" from tix tonight for a 1/2 price dinner. The tix tonight guy made us a \""reservation\"" and when we showed up they said they would seat us in a few minutes. While sitting there waiting to be seated multiple people kept walking in and getting seatede right away. The only other people left waiting for a table was a group of 6 guys that also checked in with the voucher. Hmmmm.... so we were getting shafted for having a voucher?  So we wait around another 15 mins and finally with an attitude we get called. This is where is gets better low and behold they seat us in the very very back corner far away from where anyone with their little beef skewers are and from the buffet! Then we see them seat the 6 guys right next to us! When we asked to be in the main dining room the hostess said it would be another 20 mins!\n\nWe decided to up and leave and as we left noticied several open tables in the main dining room! This place is a rip off and with so many other options you would think they would get it together! \n\nStay away!"
1,"VERY OVER RATED!   SLOW check in, SNOW ticket pick up, POOL closed at 4 and 5PM on a weekend.  Charges for in room frig and internet.  Many other extra fees.  OVERPRICED  Beatles LOVE Show was a great show with high ratings.  VALET Service does get 5 stars.  Would never go back to this hotel due to choices nearby."
0,"The guy working Oct 18th turned then open sign off more that 20 minutes before the 8pm close time posted.  Went in and asked if the store was still open and the response wad \""I guess I could make something.\""  Lucky we only wanted drinks.  Owner should be pissed!"
0,Decided to try something everyone wasn't raving about since everyone was saying their food was so good. Apparently no one tried the Mac and cheese. It was bland and could probably feed about 3 people. Way too huge for lunch. There were bread crumbs on top that could've been omitted and I think it could've used some salt. Will probably not be coming here again.  Plus who likes eating in a corner store/ car wash with limited seating.
2,I love Country music and I love Shania Twain.  I bought tickets for her opening night and actually had the pleasure of scoring tickets to her pre-opening night.  It was great.  She talked a lot more that day because we were the test audience for the show and she shared about her experience to get back out and perform again.  She did great all things considering.  FAST FORWARD:  Went again a few weeks ago because my fianc\u00e9 mom was in town and we knew she would love it.  This time it was a far different experience.  Shania no longer had the first time jitters and she did a lot more audience participation... While I am sure this is amazing for the folks sitting at the end seat that jump up and take selfies and such while she sings along to her songs but how BORING it was for the audience to watch all these random folks on the big screen take pictures and then we were subjected to watch these drunk young girls take a million duck face photos with her and one of the girls accidently punched Shania in the face while fist pumping... Shania FINALLY moved on when one of the girls actually jumped on her back like they were long time friends!  So after that song I thought she would get on stage....NOPE.. she continued to go through the audience AGAIN... I couldn't even see her anymore... it looked so weird on the stage while she was in the back high fiving the audience... So now this leads me to the middle-end of the show... she does a camp fire scene and pulls up a few more audience people to sit around with her while she sings... what does she do... she calls the out-of-control drunk girls up so we got to see them take more duck face selfies while she sang.  I think they could do a lot less of the audience participation and more singing and dancing.  I think if they got rid of the campfire-audience part people would be happier.  \n\nNow on the good note... she looks AMAZING and I loved all her songs!  :)
0,"I went there once and will not be back. I ordered the steak fajitas and was disappointed firstly when the plate came out as just a plate and not a sizzling entree as per usual with fajitas. However, the taste was much worse. The steak was of the lowest quality I've tasted (it looked boiled more than pan seared, and was mostly fat). There was so much salt on the fajitas that I couldn't even eat them. That being said, our waiter was a nice guy who gave us good service, but the food that i got was too bad to make it worth going back for me."
0,"Absolutely won't be back. This is one of the worst Indian \""restaurants\"" I have ever been to. I eat a lot of this cuisine across the country and this was an effrontery.  The navrattan korma was frozen vegetables in Velveeta cheese sauce. I'm disgusted. It was even the same color. \n\nThese people should not be trusted to cook for you. They have air fresheners on the walls spurting chemicals at you while you eat!  I asked about it and the guy said it was to cover up the bad smells!  I asked what bad smell and didn't get an answer. It should smell like delicious Indian food not whatever was loaded in these units. \n\nI heard they're owned by Mintt and the cakes are made there. I'm wondering what else isn't made here."
4,"Apollo enjoys the simple things in life... fresh water, kibble, tummy rubs, car rides with the window down, frolicking at the dog park, as well as walks and afternoon visits from Tim and the rest of the qualified pet sitters with Absolute Pet Care.\n\nI feel lucky that we were referred to Tim (the owner of Absolute Pet Care) when we needed a pet sitter on very short notice over a holiday weekend. Initially I was worried that we wouldn't be able to find someone who could really care for 130 pound, Great Dane (Apollo). He's a handful. On top of that, I expect the best when it comes to Apollo's needs and spending my hard earned money. Once I met Tim during (practically the day before our trip), his professionalism eased my worries and he quickly became Apollo's new best friend. I used to be a skeptic when it came to pet sitters and dog walkers, l thought it wasn't worth it. Wrong! It's totally worth it, the feeling of comfort is invaluable. I trust Absolute Pet Care with everything!  \n\nEven with a nervous owner, such as myself, Tim knew what to do. My main concern was that Apollo wouldn't adjust to a \""stranger\"" coming inside the house, but I was wrong again! In the free initial assessment, Tim went above and beyond my expectations, spending over an hour and a half getting to know us. Talk about detail-oriented! Beyond his comprehensive knowledge of pet care, Tim is one cool and friendly guy. One thing was blatantly clear from day one - Tim genuinely loves animals. The compassion and flexibility shown while working with a high-maintenance dog like Apollo is why this is my top pet sitting and dog walking service in the east valley. The name of his company says it all, Tim is absolutely the best!\n\nWith customized pet care instead of pre-determined prices and set services, I never have to pay extra for things like walks or clean-up should any \""accidents\"" occur. Since Apollo can be unruly on a leash, Tim gave me some tips and used training techniques while walking Apollo without charging extra. No unexpected costs at all. Everything is clearly outlined from start to finish so I know the exact cost ans care tp expect. They leave detailed notes for owners to read upon return, watch over the entire house and take care of all the little details, like mail, packages, etc. Further, each pet sitter is llicensed, bonded and certified. Should any sort of problem occur, I know someone can take care of my dog as well as my house.\n\nApollo enjoys spending time with Tim so much that I now use Absolute Pet Care for dog walking during the work week. That feeling of guilt when I have a late night at work or a hectic schedule is gone. There's nothing more I could ask for from a pet sitting company. Yeah, I could pay a little less and go with pet boarding, a kennel, the kid next door, a neighbor or a friend, but these pet sitters are so much more! I know this is a lengthy review, but if your a doggie parent like me, you need details. So if your going to need a pet sitter, you absolutely should contact Absolute Pet Care, especially if you live in the Old Town, Scottsdale or Arcadia areas. Apollo highly recommends it!!"
0,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  wow nothing good to say at all about this dump. Ordered a dinner dish. A ceaser salad and spaghetti. They gave me iceberg lettuce (crap) with a side of ceaser dressing. About 30 minutes later my meal comes out.  Sauce was cold.. Ten min later they finally bring it back...ABSOLUTE garbage for being in seven hiLLS. OH and you get to see the employees smoke cigs outside while your eating right in front of them. Its all can good food..i'd rather eat at pizza hut or cicis
0,"Been there today. My dog got all exiting , thought he will meet some new friends. Just kids and 1 dog on a leash . I'm still searching for a nice , crazy , open dog park. Where is it just for dogs, and they can run around no leash ."
3,First time delta out of PHX and wasn't to bad. F class as usual is overrated domestically and overpriced. \n\nService from FA's was pretty decent and the newer planes are nice with great PE systems.\n\n\nOut of all domestic travel this definitely ranked pretty high (although that's not saying much).
2,"Garcia's is a festive little place inside a strip mall, neutral beige color outside but an explosion of Mexican colors inside. The amber-filtered lighting in the bar/counter area and booths/tables is a cozy contrast to the adjoining patio, which exudes with sunshine and a hanging decorative bulbs in the evening. I recommend the latter for a nice outdoorsy Fall meal and that you grab a table on a Friday Happy Hour as soon as you get there. I was told the patio could be really crowded and noisy when High School kids from nearby congregate after school.\n\nGreeters and waiters/waitresses were attentive and overall did a good service. Food is average to say the least; they get points for plate presentation but lacks a kick of Mexican flavors that i would normally find at Moreno's. Safe bet to order are the El Grande Fiesta which consists of flautas, chimis and cheese quesadillas, and the fajita quesadilla with chicken which i thought is a decent meal for a reasonable price. The house margarita is ok too but it is not unforgettable. We were there from 5-10 on a Friday and i was really pleased at the casual atmosphere on the patio. The food may not have won me over on my first visit but i'll definitely be giving it a try and be looking for a seat at the patio again."
3,"I love the container park!! It is one of the coolest things to do with friends- Locals or visitors does not matter!\n\nThere is always cool stuff going on here! Events, music, movies!\n\nThe food and stores are super cool! It is really great for kids! Right in the middle of all these awesome little LOCAL shops is a giant playground!\n\nGo to the website, check out the calendar. I promise there is something fun coming up!! Or just go and check out the great little local merchants."
0,"Gas is cheap but.....\n\nService sucks! they don't even acknowledge you when you're at the counter. If it wasn't for their cheap as heck gas I'd ask for the place to be demolished! \n\nDon't go inside, just pay with your visa at the pump and go."
4,"Cheap food and booze? Im in!\n\nGot to love Firefly for many reasons besides the cheap dishes and booze! The atmosphere, people and servers make it all meld together perfectly.\n\nMost dishes here are delicious and the one i was particularly fond of was the lamb chops! Two for about $10?! Amazing! \n\nCheck out my Firefly food pictures among other on my Instagram! @dentalgaymer"
3,The food is excellent and the delivery service is outstanding.  They handle everything with a smile. We've eaten our way through the menu and haven't found anything that wasn't good.
1,"I was at Rio casino playing poker recently and happened to look across the hall and saw what I thought was a mirage. So I went closer and was surprised to find out a new Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas that no one has talked about yet . The name is called \""Pho Da Nang\"". Their menu consists of many popular Vietnamese items, such as Pho, Bun Thit Nuong, rice dishes, etc... \n\nTwo things that came to my mind when I was browsing through the menu. The first thing is I gotta try their Pho and hopefully (very hopefully) that Vegas finally has a good Pho joint. The second thing that came to my mind was \""what the pho with the price\"".Holy macaroni, their Pho has to better be damn good if they want to charge $15 a bowl + tax. Almost eveything in their menu ranges from $13 to $15, Normally you would find this prices in the strip, but Rio is like 5 blocks away from Chinatown. \n\nAnyway, I ordered their Pho combo and it came out pretty quick. The bowl consists of noodle, rare steak, sliced beef shank (what the heck??? beef shank doesn't go with Pho, beef shank normally go with Bun Bo Hue), and soup. For those that are not familiar with Pho, the combination normally goes with thinly sliced rare round steak, cooked brisket, tripe, tendon. \n\nDid this bowl of Pho pass my taste test? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. The soup was bland and un-flavorful (is this a word?). I had to put a bunch of fish sauce and hoisin sauce to make it edible. The thinly sliced steak was tender, but the beef shank tasted fatty and not right for Pho. Overall, Pho is two stars.\n\nOverall, they better cut down the price or improve the quality if they want to attract local customers. Since it's so close to Chinatown, I highly doubt they can rely on tourists as their main customers if they don't improve on their food."
2,Not bad at all. The refried beans and rice were standouts.
2,"The location is great (being in the centre of Places des Arts), and the decor is great. They have really good cocktails but the food is just below average. Go there for the drinks and the ambience, not for the food."
1,"Fun entrance and nice decor.  Took a client to lunch and it was almost impossible to hear her speak above the music.  Note to self:  Don't bring anyone you want to talk to. The server noticed that we couldn't hear each other and offered to turn the music down.  It's one thing to create an environment, but just loud music for lunch doesn't cut it.  Food was good, but  $12.00 tacos seems a bit pricey.  Needs help on making the food live up to the prices."
3,"Move the hell over Hash House; there's a new breakfast/brunch joint in town with pancakes just as oversized as yours! The Griddle Cafe is known as the \""Disneyland of breakfast,\"" for offering great pancakes and scrambles. I've been to the original one on Sunset in LA and they were spot on with the decor and ambiance. The place was packed on a Saturday morning, but the line moved quickly and we were seated within 10 minutes (as opposed to over an hour with Hash House). \n\nTheir menu is pretty vast, but you only need to pay to their oversized pancakes and egg specialties. For sweets, we opted for the \""Banananana\"" pancake and the \""Mom's French Toast.\"" Between four people, we could barely make a dent in the pancake. The thing I like about the pancakes and French toast is that they're good as is - the addition of any maple syrup actually makes it worse (way too sweet). For our savory options, we tried the \""Poached y Papas\"" Benedict and the \""Some like it HOT\"" Scramble. It's definitely the most creative Benedict I've tried; I loved the potato skin in place of the English muffin. The spicy scramble was as advertised especially if you like your eggs with an actual hot sauce. \n\nAs a coffee fanatic, I could appreciate that their coffee is served French-press with complimentary refills. The medium roast tasted pretty dark to me, which I didn't mind, but beware. It was a great meal and we ended up taking a lot of leftovers back. There are some kinks to be worked out with the service, but The Griddle Cafe is off to a great start. Best of all? You can satisfy your breakfast cravings 24/7."
2,"Rating the way the hotel rooms look, and solely just look, I give this place about 4 - 4.5 stars. I like the decor and everything, definitely one of my top 3 favorites, after vdara and palazzo. \n\nBut regarding the hotel as a whole, 3 stars is more justifiable. First off, the location sucks. Why oh why does it have to be so far away from the strip? And second, the reception here is HORRIBLE (regarding the hotel rooms, not the lobby and general casino area). I've been to two rooms, floors 2 and 6, and none of them have service. If anything, you can get service for about 5 minutes and then POOF its gone. It's very irritating. And there's also no free wifi, $12.99 for 24 hours per device. Free wifi in the lobby supposedly though, but I couldn't seem to find a decent connection.\n\nAnd the bathrooms in the rooms look really nice, but the doors? Oh my effing piece of crap they are the most annoying doors I have ever came into contact with. They look nice, don't get me wrong. I looked at them and was like wow how modern and stylish and stuff...but there is no way to close them without making the HUGEST sound. They just slam by themselves unless you grab them and slowly close them each time. Trust me, if you stay here, you'll know what I'm talking about. \n\nAs for the rest of the hotel, of course as everyone knows, their buffet is very popular. I like how they also have hash house a go go here as well. And their bakery babycakes is pretty good too. \n\nA major plus is the pool area. Pretty fun and interesting. One of my favorite pools in vegas (I think monte carlo has the best though). Its two split pools with lounge chairs in the middle and spread around. The music they play is upbeat and gets you dancing in a fun way. The house/pop music is played in the 21+ pool to the side. That area was alright, a lesser version of tao beach in my opinion. I'd rather go swimming in the main pool.  \n\nThe gym is pretty nice, better than some of the other hotel gyms in vegas. BUT its $15.99 per hotel guest, which is annoying because usually gym memberships are free with being a guest. And it's not nice enough to pay $15.99.\n\nSo three stars because even though this place definitely has its ups, I'm very annoyed with how much they charge for things that should be free. The location is a hassle. And they need to do something about cell phone reception because I use my phone a lot."
3,Great high quality italian for the family that is CONSISTENT every Time!
1,Overrated! Really. I have to say it.
3,"The green is a blissful centerpiece of Charlotte, our very miniature version of Central Park.  There are unique sculptures that are scattered about the park and fun road signs pointing to random yet creative destinations.  The park is a fun place to take your kids after some ice-cream to run some sugar out of their systems or to walk hand in hand with your significant other while the sun is beating down.  I tossed a penny into fountain with the man-sized fish around each corner.  Often times, The Green is reserved for weddings and receptions, but I would chose a less busy destination.  I just enjoy wandering down the paths to catch some relaxation."
4,"Well, my husband and I LOVE culinary dropout ...they don't have one in Southern California yet that I know of but we usually make it a point to come here every time were in AZ. We visit family here and my husband works here so when we get the chance to come we always do. We have never been disappointed . I love the cheese platter- pretzel anything there- drinks are always spot on-. We spend usually 2-3 hours each time were there just drinking and eating till we can't move. We usually go mid day and a lot during the week which is why we've never hit a real busy time. Tonight well be going so it'll be our first nighttime visit. Can't wait - foods great and drinks are creative"
3,"Grew up in Montreal and used to go here as a kid on the occasional Saturday morning, with my dad and his friend, after a morning of playing chess with them. They would get the \""regular\"" more fatty smoked meat sandwich. I always opted for the leaner one as I had quickly developed an aversion to gobs of fat in my food. It was still a very good and formidable sandwich for a young kid, and the last one I ate must have been 25 yrs ago. I remember marveling at all the interesting looking preparations behind the counter and wondering what they were and how they tasted...    Fast forward 25 yrs and to San Francisco where out of the blue last week I developed a bad craving for smoked meat.  If anyone knows where I can get some in the Bay area, please let me know."
1,Perhaps this place was having an off night because the sushi I ordered was nothing spectacular.  Rice was incredibly dry and it really just didn't taste that great.  Good cocktails though and the edamame is always sure to please (regardless of where you are).  \n\nCan't say I would ever go back.
3,"I like the pillows in the booths. \nI dislike the length of time it takes to get a shot of wheatgrass.\nThe juices and smoothies taste amazing and fresh.\nThe prices are ridiculously high. \nClean, great decor, aesthetically pleasing.\nNo patio or outdoor seating."
4,"Unlike most places, this place is NOT stingy on the toppings! Love that! I got a salad, made just the way I like it, and it did not disappoint. I'm a big meat eater and I hate when places are stingy on the meat! Plenty of choices for the non meat eaters as well :)   Staff was very friendly and prices are great!\nThe only downside would be the location. It was kind of hard to find."
0,"I would like to start with...go to another hotel. \n\nCheap rooms with pretty decor. Sink and shower faucets literally loose as a goose. Sunk in tub for a homeless person, or maybe, yeah maybe a homeless person had just taken a soak in it. Yep, that's it. It was gross. Towel holders on the wall fell to the ground when I hung my towel. Not very effective. Had to call security(manager that took 30 min to get there. Had to make a 2nd call to front desk and threaten that we would check out) on several 17 year old high school punks drinking and talking outside our door, oh and also mocking and threatening us. We are grown ass adults and don't have to put up with their crap. The chaperones should be shot since they were out there too. \n\nThe one star is for the bartender we had with our supper at the crappy Addiction restaurant. He is very nice and accommodating. He even remembered us the next day and said hi. He is alright in my book."
3,Delicious offerings for tapas with friendly staff. Get with Kevin at the bar! The August happy hour 2 for 1 is a great deal. Check out the restaurant week special because it will be worth it! We liked everything we ate - 6 dishes between 2 people plus wine. The rabbit was fantastic. The crab & eggplant tapas was perfect. The egg dipped artichokes are a must! Get some friends and head over to the bar today.
0,"Wow, this dull theme park of a restaurant is horrible. Kids would love it, but the prices are way too high for a family. They have a big longhorn steer in a corral near the front door, so the entrance smells like cow pies. Not appetizing! \n\nWe were seated right by a door that kids were shrieking in and out of, and the hostess refused our request to move to a nearby clean, empty table. The waiter was fine, but the food was completely disappointing -- nothing was seasoned. The salad and fry bread were OK, but the sauteed shrimp had not seen any salt, pepper, herbs, anything. They tasted boiled actually. it came with rice mixed with mushrooms, celery and green beans, no salt or flavor in that either. My colleague's bone-in rib-eye, ordered medium-rare, was chewy and bland. I guess we should have been on alert when the waiter placed the bottle of steak sauce on the table first. Why wouldn't they at least salt a nice steak? \n\nPrices for their tasteless entrees were high, from $25 to $35. This place is awful. Even if you go expecting Western fun and music, you should at least get a great meal for the price. Not here."
0,"I really wanted to like this place. The location is nice and the tables are spacious. It can be both informal or formal and the seating and decor are mellow. The service was very good and our server Aaron was excellent. However....the food is another story.\n\nWe started with an appetizer that was fine but our meals were terrible. My date ordered the dijon chicken and it was incredibly dry and also came with TWO HAIRS in it!  My kobe burger was also very dry and unexciting. The bun was stale and the beef was extremely dry and tasteless. For dessert we ordered  a large chocolate cake that was $11. It was okay, but nothing exciting.\n\nI'm not a food snob but for the money I would expect a lot more. Sorry to say that this was my first and last experience at Destihl. I hope others have a more favorable experience."
4,"I have never, ever not enjoyed myself at Petra's! Its grown up & sexy, 21 & up, the atmosphere & ambiance are on point and its generally just the perfect place for a night out! Great date night place for an intimate experience, especially for LGBT, but I think anyone could enjoy themselves here!"
4,"I just learned about this hidden gem recently and decided to give it a try.  I love a good burger and this place rocks.  I drove all the way from Central Phoenix for this burger.  The decor is very lively; it is red, black and white.  An added plus is the coordinating modern restrooms.  This place fills a burger niche that is needed.  You are able to get a good sized grass fed burger without having to commit to a 1 hour sit down meal and $25.00. Where I live I can only get a burger at a dine in restaurant or a classic drive-through.  I LOVE this place. \n\nNow the food:  The burger was cooked perfectly.  I like mine med-rare to medium.  The extra toppings and the secret sauce were yummy as well.  The bun was not soggy as someone else said and the place was very clean.  The fries were cooked just right and slightly seasoned.  The price was more than fair for what I received.  Did I mention FRESH AND GRASS FED?\n\nThe menu had a lot of burger combos to choose from as well as hot dogs.  I am definitely going back for a hot dog and will try to make room for the cheesecake.  I heard it is outstanding as well.  \n\nWhat I liked most was the fact that a couple of the owners were there and helping out.  They seemed very hands on and just all around good people.  \n\nI hope they expand in the very near future and a location lands close to my house in Central Phoenix."
4,"Friendly wait staff, upscale decor, the front of the bar does not do it justice at all, had I known this bar would be this nice I would have visited it sooner! The food was great and the prices were reasonable :) tons of tv's to watch the games but not too overwhelming which is great if your going in to grab a few drinks and enjoy a date night. I highly recommend this bar!"
3,"Came here for restaurant week and I very much dug the decor. Especially the wall of bottled spirits. That was kinda kickass and the only thing it was missing was one of those rolling library ladders.\n\nThe food itself was alright but nothing mind-blowingly spectacular. For appetizers, we had the chips and spinach artichoke dip which was extremely cheesy and creamy but not overpoweringly so. An excellent appetizer, I must say.\n\nNext was the entree. I ordered the blackened mahi. It was topped with crab meat and tomato creole. Didn't really taste much of the creole sauce but the crab meat was pretty good. The mahi itself was kinda bland and didn't have much flavor. A friend ordered the citrus-glazed soy salmon or something and I had a bite of that and it was pretty good! But on the side, the honey-roasted carrots were super awesome. They were soft, gooey but not mashed gooey, sweet, and just very flavorfull.\n\nAnd finally dessert, the white chocolate brownie was quite good. Complex in its design and presentation but simple in its taste. But sometimes, simplicity tastes excellent! What we have is essentially a brownie topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and ribbon-like shavings of white chocolate. Can't go wrong with that, yeah?\n\nSo in the end, I'd give this place a 3.5 stars. The food, while good, wasn't spectacular and my mahi was kinda bland. But the dessert and the decor made up for it and it's a neat little place to take a lady out on a date to. Yay!"
2,"This cute, little, Italian restaurant is on the corner of Harmon and The Strip (near Bubba Shrimp and below Twin Peaks). This is the full restaurant and bar that is next door to the quick service pizza parlor of the same name. It's a small space with a bar area, tables, and an outdoor patio. It's cutely decorated and has a nice ambiance and vibe to it.\n\nWe came here because we had a Groupon. It seemed like a good deal. However, as mentioned in previous reviews, it's deceptive. It's advertised as half-off and worth up to a $127 value. But there's not much on the menu that's more than $15-16. I noticed on the bottom of the menu that you can add meatballs, chicken, salmon, etc. to any entree, so I thought I'd add to the value by doing that. But to my surprise, when we got the check, we had to pay for that. Really lame.\n\nThe service was nice and friendly, and very attentive.\n\nThe food was all tasty, but none of it was exceptional. We started with the caprese and calamari. Both were 3 stars. Perfectly good, not awesome. We then had the bolognese and penne vodka (plus meatballs) for entrees. Both were also 3 stars. Very good, not awesome. For dessert, we had the tiramisu and cheesecake. 3.5 to 4 stars for those. The cheesecake was made with ricotta, which gave it a different flavor and made it unique.\n\nAll in all, we actually had a wonderful date here and we both agreed we would do it again. The tables each have crayons on them so you can draw on the white butcher paper over the tablecloths. And we totally had fun with that. And again, the service was great and the ambiance was nice. But the Groupon was not much of a savings or really worth it."
0,"worse than the garbage they call their enchilada sauce.\nMy husband and I went there this evening, the man who took our order (finally) spoke one word the whole time we were ordering which was \""combo?\"" To my request for the #3. We got home to discover his beef nachos filled with bell pepper and onions. No big deal, maybe we should've asked. We go back, I explain he doesn't eat this and ask to exchange it. The man has to call the manager (while I'm at the car explaining to my husband that ALL their meat choices apparently come with the peppers and onions) I come back and he gives me his phone so the manager can explain that her employee told us there would be peppers and onions in the meat. I asked if she would just refund my money and she very condescendingly said \""well just this once\"". No apology, no customer service  .\nI would rather drive the extra 10 minutes to the next closest one than go back."
1,"What happened? I had Ono's at a different location and it was decent. This location? Horrible. First off, the staff consists of ghetto high school kids with attitudes and no smiles or even a personality. The chicken, on 2 seperate occasions, was REALLY fatty. You find yourself spending most of the time picking off the fat than eating. The rice wasnt cooked correctly one visit. The flavors of some of their sauces are ok, but that wont get me to go back. Especially when Chiptole is a few doors down. And especially when its vastly overpriced. Good portions, but too bad most is inedible."
2,I didn't care for the outdoor parking.  On a sweltering summer's day I am not too keen on walking around the parking lot looking for my car then suffering 1st degree burns from the hot seat.\nIt does have some of the brands I like & they are in an A/C enclosed setting so that was a plus.  Now the food court is truly pathetic.  Talk about having to choose from Bad or really bad food.
0,"I have been to many Harbor Freight stores here in the \""valley\"". Most, the staff have been very helpful and only 5 or 6 people in line at the most. Great deals on merchandise for those that are patient ; ) This location at 35th Ave and Bethany Home is the worst. On some Fridays at about 2pm, the management and day staff goes home early leaving the store short staffed with only 2 clerks. One has a bad attitude. The \""head cashier\"" who looks like she's a local tweaker allowed a line to build up of literally 20 customers and refused to open a register herself. The only cashier that was open was helping a customer for about 15 minutes with check problems and was dialing away numbers to the Camarillo, CA office to get approval. It took her 15 minutes to reach someone in accounting while the 20 of us stood in a long line waiting. Some of us asked the head cashier to open up a register and ring us up. She refused and blamed the company for short staffing her. Bad attitude. Told us this is just the was it is on Fridays when the staff runs out from day shift. Finally at 3pm a manager walks in the store and asks whats going on. Some of us customers complained and this cashier finally hops on a register so she doesn't get reamed by the manager. I will not be back to this store location. I will stick with the Glendale and Tempe locations."
1,Beer wasn't great and the menu was pretty lame... I expected a much better menu. Very disapointing. Gordon beirsch looks like fine dinning in comparison... I won't be back.
3,"Yummy! So this is what 'real corn beef hash' should look like and taste? I've only been here for breakfast, now I have to try their lunch & dinner. If you go there for breakfast, get their early or expect to wait. It's a small and popular place."
0,"So I just felt like some fries nice golden crunchy fries and soft on the inside, I went through the drive thru ended up waiting for 5 minutes for my large fries. The worst part of it all, was that my fries were like bottom of the bag and lukewarm, it was terrible. I will next time I want fries I will grab potatoes and make them myself."
3,"I met a colleague here for lunch and we dined in the Grille area.  He works in Fountain Hills and picked this place.  It's kind of out of the way for me, but the food here is solid, so I can't complain.\n\nI had the Cheeseburger Sliders and Fries.  They were excellent.  Service here is impeccable.  The servers made sure we were well attended to and kept our drink glasses full.  I'd like to come back and have dinner sometime.\n\nThe vibe here is stuffy country club...so if that's not your deal, don't come here.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
2,"I wish this burger was more memorable. We ate here in may when they had a military 2 for 1 burger promotion so we took advantage of that. They didn't advertise it really, it was just on the website at the very bottom. \n\nOne thing I loved about all three Gordon Ramsay establishments while I was in Vegas this weekend was the Innis and Gunn beer selection on tap. Here they had a stout (a porter at Steam, and a pale ale at Pub&grill). They are oak aged beers and taste awesome. Apparently the server said they were Gordon's fav beers (at least on the menu)and I can see why.   \n\nI did enjoy my burger just didn't blow me away for some reason. I had the euro which was tasty and cooked well. The truffle fries and dipping sauces were very good. Wish I was hungry enough for a shake but too full since this was our third stop on our Gordon Ramsay crawl of the strip."
1,"Do NOT order the wings. For $14 you get scrap parts of the wings, which they call \""lollipops\"" and their way of trying to convince you that they make it easy for you to eat...YA, because there is no more meat for you to eat to even get messy. They basically strip off all the meat and leave you with the bone and the driest parts. There are no drums(middle pieces). Literally there is no meat. I had ordered the General So wings. Anyways I would assume the flavor will be amazing but it was terrible. It was too salty and tasted like sweet and sour sauce out of a packet from Panda Express. What does it take to be a good chef? Just making the food look pretty rather than taste good or even filling? I was basically served chicken bones cleaned up and presented to me on a plate with some sauce on the side. I am so offended that they could get away with serving this garbage and charging for it. What do they do with the actual meat? I don't know if I would be more upset if they threw it away or used it on another dish, which means they get paid twice for it."
3,"Please note that I have not dealt with Dr. Crovetti. My review is regarding Dr. Bahlduini and his nurse. One comment about Dr. Crovetti's front desk staf - they could truly take some classes in customer service because in person and on the phone they have been a bit short, and seemingly irritated, put out that I wanted to talk to Bahlduini's nurse (she insisted I call back so I didn't get the attitude). I have become increasingly sensitive to those in the customer service who have these jobs but act like its such a chore to provide the core service of their job... but I digress.\nDr. Bahlduini was referred to me from St. Rose (St. Martin Campus) and is an orthopedist. My knee injury was of concern to the ER doctor when she found out I had an avulsion fracture (where the ligament tore a chunk out of my tibia when it tore loose). The doctor is very knowledgeable and he has several athletes that he sees to (this is of interest to me because  I ride dirtbikes and motorcycles and this knee thing seems pretty scarey as far as what I will be able to do going forward after surgery).\nHis nurse is very nice, and has done everything she could to expedite the process of getting MRI approval from my insurance and getting me scheduled for everything necessary on a very tight timeline (I leave the state/country in a little over a week). If anything changes as far as the service I receive from these two awesome people, I will be sure and update the review. Otherwise I couldn't be more pleased with the speediness of service I have received."
0,"Extremely unhappy with the food I got here. Spend your money elsewhere!! The food was SO BAD that it spoiled half of my day in Vegas. I haven't had such bad food in a long time.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I had went to Wicked Spoon a few years and it was my favorite buffet in Vegas at the time, but it has gone downhill since then. We paid 88ish total for the two of us. It's definitely hard to get your moneys worth here unless your fine eating crappy tasting food. \n\nFOOD:\nThe two most expensive things here are probably the crab legs and the prime rib. I don't really eat much cooked seafood, so I didn't eat the crab. I love steak, so I loaded up on the PRIME RIB. Unfortunately, it tasted like DOG FOOD. That spoiled my appetite and I couldn't eat much more. \n\nThe rest of the food offered was super cheap stuff like hometown buffet-esque. I had some cheap chicken wings, pasta, etc. Everything tasted very subpar. \n\nThe gelato used to be pretty good, but I think they get it from somewhere else now. It's much worse than before. It tasted very cheap and low quality and the texture was kind of melty. I had some lemon meringue and orange white chocolate cake that was pretty decent, but thats the only thing I semi-enjoyed. \n\nOverall, I DO NOT RECOMMEND Wicked Spoon. Service isn't very attentive either. SERIOUSLY take your money to a nice restaurant and get yourself a high quality or steak or something. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!"
1,"I stay here because I have business at the University. The last time I stayed was on election day November 2012. I woke up the morning after the election and tried to take a shower. The stopper in the tub would not stay open and the tub reeked of urine. I complained and was moved to another room.  But it makes me wonder how the room passed any sort of housekeeping supervisor's inspection. It is still a mystery to me.\n\nThe rooms are not fully sound proof either. If you have kids in the next room, heaven help you!!\n\nThe service has gone down hill in the restaurant too. They recently had a shake up it seems and the guy who used to wait on me seems to  disappeared.\n\nBe also warned that it can take a bit to get your car from the valet. They \""mis-parked\"" my car once or twice."
2,"I'm a relatively big del taco fan. I don't eat alot of fast food but if I want some tacos these are quick and some of my fav, specifically the fish tacos they're quite tasty. \nThey also have a new like.. lower priced menu that isn't half bad. I would recommend the jacked up bean and cheese burrito off of that menu..."
0,I come to the auto center since my car battery is under warranty here. I needed to change my battery because my car died that day and my warranty expires this month. I felt lucky at first arriving at a nonbusy time. Little did I know it would take them a whole hour just to get my car keys back so the guys could work on my car! It was like dealing with dumb and dumber! Neither of them knew what they were doing. They were confusing each other and talking crap about the work issues they have there. They kept telling me I had the wrong battery size and had to do an exchange now which requires a manager. The manager had zero personality. Seemed like nothing in their computers were working right. The guy had to scan my car battery at least 6xs. They said the battery they gave me was larger but said I wouldn't need to pay a difference. In all their confusion the cashier guy handed me $12... I'm pretty sure I was not due credit.. Ugh! Last time here!
4,no other place like it.\n\n\nleave your girlfriends/wives at home.
1,"I have had my fair share of buffets in Las Vegas, but the Wynn buffet was quite a disappointment. At $35 per person for brunch, the buffet lacked both variety and flavor. The Asian food station was bland, the sushi was too fishy and the seafood unappetizing. Italian food was decent though but the desserts were average. I was expecting more from this place but it let me down. Service was great though."
0,The most unprofessional Dr. I have ever dealt with. This is my 2nd visit with him and both times I have been kept waiting for an alarming amount of time. The first time i sat in the waiting room Almost 2 hours. This time i have already been here an hour and 15 mins and HE ISNT EVEN IN THE BUILDING and he had patients starting 3 hours ago!!!! Do not waste your time here. He obviously has no respect or courtesy for anyone other than himself.
2,"The drinks are awesome. While the food is pretty good, It adds up since they are small plates. Don't go there hungry, but more so to enjoy drinks and an appetizer. Always prepare for an hr wait."
3,"We need a place like this in town. Seafood is flown in every day-ish and the staff is awesome. If you can, ask for Matthew. Great personality and will help you figure out how to find the meat in a blue crab!!"
4,this place was amazing the food was great and not that expensive. It was super cool how Chef Carlos came out to introduce himself and after we were done with our meal he came out just to make sure everything was ok.. The burger was nice and juicy. My wife had a chopped steak and that was great the mashed potatoes were good and the steak was juicy and cooked to perfection. This is going to be our new weekly place to eat.
1,I guess I didn't order the right sandwich because out of all the awesome reviews my sandwich was just.... OK. I got the Italian and was not really impressed. It was just a small amount of meat and a slice of cheese with stock Italian dressing. So what's the big deal?? Ok I'm gonna have to go back and order something else because I gotta see what all the hype is about! To be continued...
2,"The food  was great  too bad the service was terrible.  I would go back but would make sure I did not get the same server.  It would have earned them a 4 star.  It was not just that the kitchen was backed up, she was not even friendly or checked on us."
1,"It's basically a loud, dimly-lit sports bar that serves cheap, greasy 1/2 finger food after 11pm. Nothing really stood out and, again, the food was really greasy. \n\nMeh. Go if you have midnight munchies and you want cheap food."
3,I love pizza and have to say this place is awesome!! Worth the drive if you dont live close. It isnt your ordinary pizza place. The dough is amazing.....I have visited twice and both times have been very please with food and service.\n\nOnly reason why I didnt give it 5 stars is because it is cash only. There is an atm machine....but I personally like the convenience of using my debit card at POS.\n\nI will definitely be back. Cant wait to try the baked ziti!!
0,"Well....what can I say?\n\nI have heard about these dang cupcakes for years now. Then, one finally opens in Scottsdale. My 10 yr old neice and I get in the car to make the drive (talking the whole time about how excited we are).\n\nWe get to Sprinkles (which is in a horrible location) and walk in to order. It is the tiniest place with about 10 cupcake flavors to offer. My niece looks at me like \""this is it? this is what we have been talking about for months?\"" I sigh.... I know.\n\nWe get two cupcakes to go (you can only order in even numbers!!! WTF). We order chocolate chocolate and peanut butter chocolate. THE WORST CUPCAKES EVER!!! For $9 we get 2 cupcakes!!!!  .... We take two bites in the car and then throw the rest away. Horrible. We made better cupcakes from Betty Croker $.99 mix from Safeway last week.\n\nSo So So Sad! They should be ashamed of themselves!"
4,"The Tech just left, I will post up a few other reviews because the service and the workmanship have always been great. I have purchased THREE units from them and had service done 2 times. Well, this call was because I was unsure if the unit was working right. They came right out, spent over a hour making sure all the readings were correct and I even programmed the thermostat (Which made a huge difference).\n\nTHANKS SCOTTSDALE AIR!"
1,"No. With all of your other options in Vegas for buffets (Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal), this just doesn't cut it. Food was dry, sitting out too long, and the cheaper price attracts a ...cheaper crowd...if you know what I mean. You're in Vegas, spring for the good buffet!"
1,"I am a consummate Nordstrom's Rack shopper, whenever a new one opens within a 2 state area (California/Nevada) I try and make it out.  All of the best stuff seems to come when a new Rack opens.  I have been to upwards of 15 Nordstrom Racks and some are certainly better than other, however, none are worse than this one.  The Men's Department is laughably small and the selection is rubbish.  There was nothing at all that I could find to buy.  In fact I was so disheartened that I thought a little shopping might cheer me up and I went to the Rack in Henderson and purchased 2 sweaters.  I had high hopes for this new Rack but I doubt I will make the journey back out to Summerlin just for this store.  Very disappointed indeed."
4,"Yonaka is good VERY GOOD.  You need to come here for some delicious tasting eats.\n\nCome here for their Happy Hours.  There's a separate Happy Hour menu.  They run from 5 pm - 6:30 pm and 11 pm - 2 am.  I've only been to their 11 pm Happy Hours which doesn't get to busy.  Sit at the bar if it's available or at one of their tables though they both work out good.  \n\nA must have is their Crispy Brussel Sprouts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=3_WTe2cZ1rDORg9bsAWJgg#3_WTe2cZ1rDORg9bsAWJgg there are better pics but this was mine. So good and so refreshing.  They're brussel sprouts with lemon chili, mint, and puffed rice all charred up together. Didn't really care for the puffed rice but so good.\n\nAnother must have is their Tea Brined Ribs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q#De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q again there's probably better pics.  They're pork ribs in a citrus citrus-honey-tea glaze and sesame.  Sweet and tasty, not your typical BBQish pork rib.\n\nAnother must have is their Karaage  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q#4SDCYEHrg0maFggCW_1T5g  I didn't take a good pic so I stole one.  They're this fried on the outside and juicy on the inside fried chicken pieces with jalapeno, mint, basil, and onion.  The best way I can describe it all is like fried frog legs but not really.  You bite into them and after you past their fried outsides it feels like it burst opens with it's moist insides. I don't really know how to explain it just try it. Spicy, yet refreshing. \n\nWho am I kidding almost everything is a must have. Here's a few more items I've had with a pic.\nThere's Gyu Sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=8bju5AS8EBNp7o4aO6k9Lw#8bju5AS8EBNp7o4aO6k9Lw \nA Seasonal Sorbet Selection http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=yAxLlRGdxR-3axaQ2Jc7zw#yAxLlRGdxR-3axaQ2Jc7zw \n\nEat everything slowly and in small bites that's how I'd eat it all. Nice interior and excellent service and very friendly staff. They have special daily items. And there's sake.\n\nIf you need a quick phone charge while you eat there's a power outlet next to the tables near the hostess counter.  It's right there so why not use it just don't go setting up shop there.\n\n3 more hour 'til 11pm I'll be there haha"
4,"holy moly.  we decided to join crce so we could swim in the winter and a few other things we can't do at our regular gym.  first of all, we forgot that times have changed so were totally shocked when we walked in the door.  this place looks like a health club in any major metropolitan city.  not the same scene we had on the same campus when we were students last in the early 90's.  the awesome indoor pool with giant waterslide, huge spa, and multiple seating areas with yet more spa-like bubbles was fun to see.  there are more cardio machines than you can imagine at least 4 gym areas for basketball, indoor soccer, irish dancing groups ( we observed this evening), a handfull of racketball courts, an elevated track, weights, and couches with wide screen TV's.  There are tons of windows everywhere so while you are working out you can stare off into the beautiful horizon...ok, maybe i'm going a little too far here.  but you can at least look outside.  it was a tad crowded at 10pm when we got there but we found out that if we work out early we'll likely have the place to ourselves...duh."
1,"Boneless Wings had a tasty sauce, but not enough sauce and too much coating for my taste."
0,Saw roaches on the floor. Waitresses were hella rude. Complained to the manager and she spit in our faces and cursed us out. The chef looks like a fat sweaty slob. Just a horrible experience. Customer service is foreign to them.
4,"After not getting my gels done in nearly a month, I, finally, had time to pop in before work. \n\nBefore I even sat down, I had many ideas of nail designs running through my head. Asked John if he could do an easter/pastel colored ombre on me, showed him of what I was thinking, and he said: \""that's easy!\""\nHe proceeded to show me an ombre design he did a few days prior and it was exactly what I was looking for.\n\nAfter no later than an hour, I got my yellow/green/blue ombre nails and I couldn't have been happier. John took his time and was very pleasant and fun to talk with.\n\nI think I've found my new favorite nail tech here. That makes 3 nail techs for me to choose from. I'm very happy about that =)"
1,"I went to Tao with three friends and we were very disappointed in our experience.   We were rushed through the entire meal.  The server kept hovering around the table to take our order even though we were just seated.  After we placed our order, he forgot to bring one of the appetizers.  Then, our entrees were brought out before we finished our appetizers.  We were asked about dessert before the table was cleared.  It is unusual for four women not to want dessert, but we were just not up for any with the remains of dinner in front of us.  We did like the atmosphere.  The food was good, although I wish my meal, the Roasted Buddha Chicken, was a larger portion.  Overall, we were really looking forward to a nice night and meal, and Tao did not measure up due to service issues."
4,"The flavors are awesome. This is coming from a person who makes Indian food, so i know flavors and spices a lot.\nI am coming here next time too. I had catfish (Kari Lele) and it was tooo good."
0,I was excited to get Mexican food while visiting Arizona and this restaurant is so cute it looked great. We were happy with the seating and it was packed. But the food did not live up to our expectations. The dishes ranged from mediocre (the meat dishes) to horrible. The vegetarian dish was the worst. Multiple dishes marked vegetarian (with their symbol system on the menu) actually weren't when I inquired about the sauce. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and ended up with a plate of rice and beans. Literally. Half the plate was refried beans and rice. The other half was an uncooked flour tortilla with the exact same rice and beans and a tiny bit of melted cheese. I asked for more salsa and some guacamole for some flavor but even the guacamole was rather tasteless. I literally could have made this dish with a tortilla and some refried beans from a can. So disappointed with this.
3,"I was so happy when this place opened up a couple years ago because it meant I had another option that is within walking distance of the office where I can eat lunch for less than $10.  There aren't many in this part of town, let me tell you.  I haven't been in a while since I have been watching my calorie intake.  I know, I know I can get the \""bowl\"" (salad) option.  But I really don't have enough willpower to go in there and not get a burrito or crunchy tacos.  Plus, I have to walk right past Sprinkles cupcakes and that is just torture."
0,"On Thursday 3/28 I received a flyer from Rosatis at work.  Since we have ordered Rosatis pizza in the past and really liked their product we thought it was nice that they had a location so much closer to us now. \n\nHere's why they get 1 star.\n\nWe ordered an XL thin crust pizza for delivery and were told it would arrive in an hour and the total was $25.  No problem, that's normal for Rosatis, and quality food takes time.  \n\nThe delivery guy arrived on time (right at an hour) and was acting kinda weird.  He seemed nervous and set the pizza on the desk.  We signed for it and said thanks.  He just kinda stood there and looked at all of us (there were three in the room).  I asked if there was anything else?  He said \""no\"" and sort of shuffled out, looking at us the entire time.\n\nWe took the pizza into the other room and opened the box.  Now it made sense.  The pizza had been in a horrible collision as if it had been dropped and was like a ball of pizza in the corner of the box.\n\nI called to reconcile the problem and explained the situation, expecting we'd get a refund or the next pizza free.  The lady at the other end of the phone said this \n\n\""um... sorry.\""  So I said \""ok...\"" To which she replied \""are there any other major complaints?\""  So I asked her to get her manager and have him call me back.\n\nThe manager called back and apologized and said he'd give us $2 off our next pizza.\n\nSo we don't get a free pizza, but if I ever order from that location again I will get a pizza that costs $23.  Thanks for the $2.  I don't think I'll be cashing in on your offer."
4,"I LOVE Bosa! And to be honest, I prefer them over Dunkin Donuts! Friendly staff and delliiicciooousss donuts and cheap too! :) Their breakfast food items are really good too!!! I recommend this place for donuts over Dunkin any day if the week!"
0,"Do not go to this location. I've been going to the scottsdale and Shea location for years and the food and service there are just better in every way. Maybe a managerial thing? Let's start with probably the worst hostess I've ever dealt with at any restaurant. Went at almost 9pm still a little busy. She told us the wait was 15 mins but I saw at least 3 tables that just haven't been cleaned so I say we will wait. Then she points to 2 open bar stools and says you can sit there if ya want. No thanks. We wait 15 for the tables to get cleaned, and we go to the little middle section with probably 4 out of 6 booths open and she sits us at the tiny table with 2 little chairs? Um no we'll take a booth. She rolls her eyes throws the menus on the booth table and walks away. Just rude in my opinion. Your job is customer service. Wash dishes if you hate dealing with people. Been in the restaurant business for 20 years and would never hire someone like this. Service was good. Pizza had a giant burnt bubble but it wasn't bad. Meatballs were also good. Shrimp scampi had no taste though. Pizooki was good but that's hard to mess up. Take the 15 min drive to the better location on Shea."
1,1hr wait for our food after we got a seat.\n\nNice scenery and awesome vibe. That's were it ends.\n\nThe Blueberry muffins was unbeatable and dry.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy was pretty dang good. Should come with sausage or bacon though.\n\nThe Carne asada burrito was pretty bland.\n\nThe sandwich made out of French toast was the best thing and it was decent at best.\n\nWe will be back to the Perch but not here.
1,"We were so looking forward to trying Herks, but unfortunately, had a not-so-great experience... we live a mile or two from the restaurant and thought delivery would be quick.  I ordered a pizza at 7pm and was told it would be an hour.  Considering it was a Friday evening, we were fine with that.  By 8:30, I called the restaurant and was told that our pizza was not there, so the driver must be on his way.  9:00pm, still no pizza... by this point, we were over it and just didn't want the driver to show up expecting to be paid, so I called again and was told they lost the order.  The guy on the phone apologized and offered to send a free pizza immediately, so I once again gave them our order.  9:30, the driver shows up and hands the pizza to us and apologized.  We weren't mad and totally understand that mistakes happen, but were pretty annoyed when we opened the box and saw they gave us a smaller pizza than we ordered.  Seriously?  Whatever, it was free... 2 hours late, but free (minus a tip for the driver).\n\nThe pizza was ok, but again, not what we ordered and it took 2.5hrs to get it.\n\nNot sure if we'll give Herks another chance."
0,"There are some good things here to eat.  The gobi manchurian is off the hook.  The Palak Paneer is really good.  However, there are some serious health code issues going on with this place.  Things are old, were cold when I get them and were buffet items from earlier in the day.  And there are cockroaches.  I had one in my food.  Unfortunately it was in the last thing I ate.........barf. The vegetables in my curry were obviously frozen from a bag.  Things taste microwaved.\nService here is kind of crap.  I saw another table get their food before us when we had ordered before them, and when we got our food things came out with 5 to 7 minutes between.  Its really awkward when I have to wait to eat and let my food get cold because were waiting for everyones food.\nAlthough the food is good, I won't be coming back here.  I am afraid of getting food poisoning, and the roach left me thinking about what other nasty thing I could have eaten during my meal."
0,"I was charged $65 to remove and reinstall a tonneau cover while having the bed sprayed. Manufacturer quotes less than 30 minutes, but it is closer to 10-15 to install. The cover was reinstalled incorrectly by the LineX tech. I would expect the technician to know what he is doing if they are charging that much."
2,"You order at the counter here, & when your order is ready you take it to your choice of several quaint little dining rooms, or the mostly enclosed, covered patio.\n\nI ordered the #C Weekday Lunch Combo, which brought out a shredded beef taco, a cheese enchilada, a green burrito, beans & rice, plus a side of chips, sold separately.\n\nThere were no booths, the portions of food were smallish, served on picnic plates, & the chips were very ordinary.  SO, 2-Stars & we're out of here, right?  ...Well, not so fast!\n\nThe excellent salsa helped the chips along, & what you get along with the modest meal size is a reasonable price ($5.95 + .50 for the chips).  Oh, & the taste of the food overall was TERRIFIC!  That's one thing, isn't it?    :-))"
1,"I loved, loved, loved the fair when I was a child. I LOVED IT. I got to see the Beach Boys in my first ever concert...such good times. I was so happy when we went. I would go at least 3-4 times while it was in town. Well, I definitely DO NOT love what the fair has become. Its a travesty, a sham, and...well...a mockery. Guys: its a Travishamockery. Let me explain why...now:\n\n~What To Do~\nWell, you will blow boatloads of cash..that's numero uno. Besides that, you can check out all the rides they offer, as well as exhibitions ranging from animals to crafts and baking, as well as the Expo area, where retailers hawk their products. Oh and the food, its the one time of the year where most people wont judge you for eating your soul away.\n\n~The Good~\nEh... there are some \""bright spots\"". The food is fun and different. I love the Indian Fry Bread stations, although every single vendor is not the same....you have to be picky. The food options are abundant as well, and if you do not care about what you put in you, its a field day for you. The Expo they hold each year has some fun vendors each year. In 2013, they weren't as much fun as previous years, but still they held my attention for a bit. I did try some of the extreme rides....holy hell, scary, but fun. I will admit I did enjoy hanging out with my fiance in cool weather, it was refreshing and relaxing to stroll around and have some fun. Also, the concerts and events they offer each year are pretty good for free admission, I simply haven't had the time or I would've hit up a number of them over the years.\n\n~The Bad~\nOy Vey...So, lets say about 7+ years ago (approximately) the whole re-invention of fairs began nationwide. With that change came increased prices, lower quality prizes, insanely fatty and poor quality foods, and whats worse: a really crummy corporate feel, by way of RCS out here in Phoenix. So now, we are left with what RCS has provided us. Its really a shell of former fun times. We still have the awesome destruction derby and concerts, as well as some fun rides still.. But they have stripped  all that away with the watered down prizes and games that are pretty much rigged....And the prizes... I mean, come on. They deduce down to dog chew toys really. Perfect size for our Yorkie and Chihuahua. Rips in about 3 days time. \n\nPrices are outrageous and I am consistently keeping an eye on spending...you are a fool to go to the fair and just spend whatever...because you will spend 100+ EASY with that mindset. I see a number of people defending the current incarnation, and it amuses me. I remember the balloon darts, when I could win a huge framed picture to hang up on my wall (I remember choosing a Michael Jordan picture)...Well, now, we have balloons, with hackisack-style balls filled with pellets. The balloon dart signs, with pictures of darts are still out there!!!!! \n\nRuining my childhood memories, that's what RCS is doing. And diets too, they just ruin so much...Up-charge me at the gate, and get rid of RCS. I do not care about spending more to get in, FOR A QUALITY PRODUCT. Getting in for free is not worth it. Just wretched. I could go on and on.. deplorable. \n\n~The Down low~\nI really am not sure where to go from here. Really am not. It's a rubbish product, really. Its like paying for a Jaguar, and getting an Aveo... its not right. I am giving 2 stars, because it actually could get worse, and if it does, I have an option to downgrade. I mentioned the redeeming factors already, which all make up the 2 stars they receive...but they do not help. Not a bit. I'll spare writing further, and let the review speak for itself. Save the money and go up North and hike and get your palms read by a hippy....or go golfing... or go to Castles and Coasters and mess around with your family....or go to Scottsdale and steal someone's Audi....or do a meth lab bust in AJ. All of these are equally invigorating and less expensive options, than spending $10 to throw a ball in a basket, attempting to win a cheap stuffed 1000'' stuffed bear."
4,"Having been to numerous other gun stores throughout the valley, I have a good barometer of how things go. Historically, gun store employees are too cool for school, and treat customers like a necessary annoyance, rather than the purpose of their existence. A friend of mine told me about Merchant Firearms, and raved about the selection, price, and service- so I checked it out.\n\nI was looking for a Mother's Day present for my Mom (yah, she's cool like that) and was looking for a particular little gun. I went to Merchant Firearms, and sure enough-they had the gun. Not only did they have the gun, but the price was awesome. That was enough for me to be happy, but the I was pleasantly shocked to see that the employees were genuinely nice, and didn't treat customers like they were shitheads (if you've been to the other places, you KNOW what I mean..)\n\nA cool guy named Simon helped me with the gun, and answered a ton of questions. When I selected the gun, Simon then had me input my info into a PC, so I could do all the paperwork electronically- which I thought was super cool, and fast. While Simon was working on his part of that, another great employee (sorry I didn't catch his name) was showing me some of the super cool long guns, and other James Bond stuff they carry. Even though I was buying an inexpensive little pea shooter, the guys treated me like I was family- and were just super nice and engaging. \n\nI ended up picking up a couple other things I was shopping for, and I was shocked at the low, reasonable price. One of the accessories was $18 at Merchant Firearms, but literally $50-60 everywhere else. When I expressed my surprise and appreciation to Simon, he explained, \""We want the prices to be fair- no one wants to walk away feeling like they got screwed.\"" (unless you're at a bunny ranch- he is right).\n\nCheck out Merchant Firearms, and if you're like me- you will be a customer for life. This place has everything, accept a shitty attitude towards customers. I look forward to purchasing some more fun stuff over the years, and I will only shop at Merchant Firearms."
1,The lunch meals are great. I did have a bad experience with the egg foo young... I could not eat it at all.
1,"All those fancy displays can't make up for their lack of customer service. \n\nI stopped in recently to take a look at their North Face section as well as their hiking boots. Honestly, I feel like stores like Sports Authority are going to be going the way of the dodo soon because their prices are MUCH higher than online retailers. Rarely a sale item will be on par with Amazon.com or other online stores. But, I figured I would stop in anyway to see what they had available in windbreakers. \n\nThe result? Not much. And everything was priced at MSRP retail to boot. Of course, I mean look at the size of the store. Look at all those employees talking to each other instead of their customers, and look at the cashier playing with her iPhone instead of looking for people to assist. That's quite the payroll to make every week. \n\nAnyway, I was in there for 20 minutes, got asked if I needed help zero times, got no glance or assistance in the shoe section, and got no \""have a nice day\"" from the cashier texting and looking down as me and another customer walked out. Yeah, Sports Authority has seen better days for sure. Big box will be dead soon and the folks \""working\"" there will have plenty of time to text from home. \n\nGood riddance!"
1,"I've always wondered if QQ Express was related to QQ Asian Buffet. But either way, although it doesn't say much, QQ Express is better than QQ Asian Buffet. \n\nThe food here is okay at best. There are more authentic dishes here than at QQ Asian Buffet. And like its all-you-can-eat counterpart, the food here can be greasy, but at least it is really cheap, so that's a plus. The other good thing is that if you're in a hurry, you'd be able to get your meal pretty quick here. The owners chose the correct business name because express is definitely an applicable description for this place."
2,"Nice rooms. Nothing over the top, but definitely a nice hotel. I wasn't happy that an outdoor concert on a Thursday night was audible in my room ... and I was on the 26th floor. The concert went until 11:30p.\n\nI guess it's Vegas, so that's OK? I'll return to the hotel, but I will get a room facing away from Las Vegas Blvd next time!"
1,"I had high expectations of this restaurant considering it was so hyped up by \""Best of....\"" and my man who kept telling me what great chinese food this was.  I cannot blame him much tho for he is a whitey :)  My comfort food is cantonese, to some people, chinese food is chinese food is chinese food.\n\nI think I just ordered the wrong dishes....I had salt and pepper shrimp.  It came with some nasty thick coating of batter, no shell or head.  \n\nThe second dish we ordered was the tofu and shrimp balls.  I was more curious and intrigued about the tofu and shrimp balls because I love tofu and shrimp and because it was sooooo expensive ($16.90).  I wanted to find out why it was so pricey and was it worth the price. It was quite interesting and not what I expected, obviously home made which is a plus.  It was nice and crispy on the outside but a strange texture on the inside: mushy and flavorless.  Not sure I would order it again.  It seemed labor intensive, but not worth $17.\n\nThe third dish we ordered was the napa cabbage with shrimp paste. It was pretty tasty and the only reason why I give this place a two star rather than a one star rating.\n\nI expected this restaurant to be cantonese which it is obviously NOT!After looking at all the other reviews perhaps I will give this place another try and order dumplings, soup, beef rolls and maybe even try green onion pancakes.  \n\n(p.s. service is good, place is clean)"
4,"Replacing Mickey's Hangover, Firehouse has done nothing but caused a bunch of memories with great people. Best days/nights to go? Any day ending in Y. I always run into someone I know and have never had an issue with anything or anybody. Super Josh Snyder is always the best at what he does and he's like a robot so his service is 2nd to none. The djs are always in the mix and always set the mood right. Christmas 2010, New Year's Eve 2011, My Birthday, Valentine's Day, my girl's Birthday, UFC Fights, Ortiz-Mayweather fight, ASU games, NFL Sundays and happy hour are just a few times that I've been there and have ALWAYS had a great time. Thank You Firehouse!"
1,The facility is clean and architecturally beautiful.  \n\nBUT why would they concrete the decking of a pool in 100+ degree days in AZ?!?!?  It's slippery and hot on your feet.  Saw someone slip and hit their head - an ambulance was called to take her to the hospital for a concussion. \n\nThe ratio of pool guest to lifeguards seems to be 3:1.  \n\nEach time there is an injury instead of taking the person up to the first aid room all 50 guards blow their whistles and corral every single guest out of the pool and the entire pool area.  You are not allowed to find your children or grab your towels or even a water!  It's an absurd practice.  I will not return.  I agree that if the guards are dealing with an emergency people should get out of the pool but to corral everyone off the grounds is a bit much.
0,"Our experience here was not the best in many ways unfortunately. We just happen to be in the neighborhood while running some errands and hungry so we stopped.\n\nThis is not our first ride on the LJS train so we know what to expect as far as taste and quality of the food.\n\nThe place was empty however one customer in front of us trying to use a coupon with a new employee so that was a total disaster. We should have left after waiting 10 minutes in line to place our order however we were there and hungry so we waited and waited and waited some more.\n\nFinally what appeared to be a Manager comes out and takes our order while the \""new\"" employee is still fumbling and bumbling trying to understand how to input a coupon into the register.\n\nIt was frustrating for us to have to witness what this woman in front of us is going through trying to place her simple order.\n\nNo apologies to her or us for the long ridiculous wait.\n\nThe food just did not taste good either, the fish was not crisp as it usually is, the coleslaw tasted off and our root beer floats were not very floaty.\n\nWe will never return to this location, we only stopped here because it was near where we were running errands.\n\nCommon sense goes a very long way! It is too bad some people don't have common sense or manners in this industry. Also however they are storing or cooking the food should be up to par like the other LJS in town. This was the worst food we have ever eaten from a LJS and truly disappointing on so many levels.\n\nBad staff and bad food, no bueno!"
3,"The premier buffet for its selection of food, food quality and table service!\n\nThe grill prepares the meats for a variety of tastes including steaks. The meat selections include all forms of ethnicities including Asian chicken and pork dishes, Mexican entrees and sides, and Italian lasagna and various pastas. The fruits and vegetables are fresh and restocked by several people stocking & serving the bar, and hot sides include all the steamed varieties. Breads, rolls and muffins are plenteous, as are the melons and fruit spread across the bars at the salads, entrees and desserts. \n\nThe servers are customer oriented and are always ready and willing to assist, and will even chirp-out a Happy Birthday or two! But wait, there's more! \n\nThe dessert bar has the famous chocolate fountain replete with an endless variety of items to dip including fruit and specialty items designed for smothering in chocolate. All of this for $12.99 per adult! This is by far the freshest and best buffet in the west. \n\nThe wait is well worth it and attests to the desirability of the food and service. People go where people are, and it's becoming the place for buffeteers!\n\nYou won't leave hungry, guaranteed!"
2,"Wendy's Noodle Cafe, located at the Western edge of Chinatown in Las Vegas, is a non-descript looking building... in which it, in it's former life, was a Pizza restaurant. Wendy, herself, is a middle-aged Asian lady, who re-located from San Diego a couple of year's ago.\n\nFirst impression upon entering... Small place, nothing fancy... most of the patrons were androgynous college-aged Asians. Thought to myself... glad my kids didn't go through this fashion phase! I think, when they were this age... baggy pants were the fashion statement.\n\n\nOnto the food...\n\nMango Pudding (**) No Asian restaurant that I've been to prepares Mango Pudding like this!\n\nWendy's Mango Pudding is a triple-layered Pudding made with Gelatin... not Milk-based that you'll find at most other Asian restaurants.\n\nThe Pudding looked OK. Triple-layered... Top and bottom layer were more opaque than the center layer, which contained bits of Mango. OK in flavor... but I didn't order J-E-L-L-O!!! All the layers were made with Gelatin... all previous Mango Pudding ordered at Asian restaurants were never made like this.\n\nRating on Yelp reduced to 3-Stars based mainly on this disappointment...\n\n#82 Singapore Noodles (**** 1/2) Perfectly made... On a 6\"" square porcelain plate you'll receive... thin Vermicelli Noodles with Bean Sprouts, slivers of Green Onion, Red and Green Bell Peppers... stir-fried with Medium-sized Shrimp, and slivers of Chinese BBQ Pork! Smaller portion than at most Asian restaurants.\n\nSalt & Pepper Tofu (**** 1/2) The square cubes of Tofu are prepared like any other Salt & Pepper entree - fried at a high temperature until the Tofu looks like small Sandstone colored bricks. The Chef then tops off the entree with Green Onions, and most impoerantly some sliced Jalapeno Peppers which gives this entree a real kick. Very, very good! I think the kids had some trepidations upon my ordering this entree... but it became the most popular...\n\nSalt & Pepper Calimari\n\n#41 Won Ton Soup (***) Kathy's order of Soup, which she said tasted \""funny\"".\n\nBTW, $15 minimum on Debit/Credit Cards..."
0,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!! I agree that they should get NO STARS but would love to make sure no one goes through what I went through!!    I have been trying to get my dishwasher fixed for three weeks.  1st time they didn't show up, second 11:45 on Thursday have to order parts was after 12 so it went on the next day ordering. conveniently it was a weekend!  Never called to let me know when the parts were in.  I called Lowe's to help me get this job done quicker only made DONNA mad so she than didn't schedule me to the following week on a Tuesday, (i have now been without a dishwasher for 2 weeks with a family of five).  Reschedule again because of weather but technician could have came in the morning but because I request first call DONNA made sure i was the last.  Today they were suppose to show and they did not and DONNA called saying we would have to reschedule.  He never rang the doorbell I have worked my schedule around this company time and time again.  VERY VERY RUDE!!! Donna has no phone etiquette! I also had them prior because of a warranty repair on my washer but I didn't realize it was the same company until having to deal with DONNA again. She was nasty that time. This was under a Lowe's warranty so make sure when you have a warranty repair make sure you tell them you don't want to work with this company!  Major headache!!!"
4,"Ambiance is amazing....very Zen, without being too Zen-y.  The massage rooms are bliss, iPods with playlists to be chosen by the client, something gorgeous to look at (flowers on the floor) and scented (or un-scented) oils that are so beautifully fragrant.  The staff is exceptionally kind.  Lockers area is complete - could leave for office right after a treatment.  Good for solo spa-goer....areas set up for solitude and the atmosphere encourages quiet.  Divine."
2,"After driving by Chicago Brewing Company countless times, I finally decided to stop by for Ken M.'s UYE last week. In short, the company was great, as was the brown ale. I sampled the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie brew... meh... not my thing. I split the wild game sliders with Norm and Tony (6 for $30) and my favorites were the rabbit, wild boar and bison. Honestly, I can't even remember what the others (alligator, antelope, rabbit/antelope mix) tasted like. It was a week ago, afterall.  If you're a fan of sliders, check it out since they're some of the more unique ones you'll find in the area."
2,Chips and salsa are amazing. Food is good. Fresh. Was disappointed to recieve fish tacos with fried fish in a restaurant of this caliber.
2,"I went here on sunday afternoon. Thought it would be good place to go to since the day was great. Sat the bar which was cool. I ordered the creme brulee shake, turkey burger and my friend (the great lover he is-lol) had a Sam burger and we shared the sweet potato fries. \n\nThe shake did not taste nothing like creme brulee, it was just plain ol vanilla shake, nothing special about this shake. I could have passed on it but hey wouldnt have known what it taste like until I tried it. \n\nMy lover-friend really liked his burger, but wished it would have came with fries automatically. My burger was ok, again I was not blown away by it. The sweet potato fries were good as always with the dipping sauce. \n\nI thought everything was ok. I kinda look at it like an ''upscale burger joint'' and I am using that term loosely. I would possibly come back, the ambiance was good, I would mos def try something different the next time I come."
1,"Price was pretty high for a burger, fries and a drink. $8.00 and some change. The burger was good but I'm a big guy, thinking this is a snack for me. I can't see a family of 4 going there for less then $25.00 for lunch."
0,We were starving and it was the only reasonably priced place open at 9:30pm in Northern Scottsdale.  The brisket was edible and the sides were mediocre.
1,"I went there twice.......the first time shortly after they opened. The restaurant was half full and the food came out quickly and was tasty. I had the Zigeunerschnitzel with Spaetzle and it reminded me of back home.\n\nThe second time was three days ago and it seemed like they did not have a real chef because the food came out one at a time with very long time in between food coming from the kitchen almost as if each was cooked individually. This time the Spaetzle were a starchy, watery mess (way overcooked) not sure how somebody can screw this up. Interestingly enough the Cordon Bleu (pork) was burned around the corners and I had to work my way half way through the thing to get a bite of ham and cheese. definitely no comparison to my first visit here. I ended up being there for almost an hour.....\n\nPro\nCheaper than others in town\nFriendly waitress\n\nCons\nFood inconsistent\nVery Slow \nyou feel like eating in the middle of a warehouse (no decor)\n\nAfter my second experience I will definitely not go back soon. The waitress actually told the owner that I was not too happy. You'd think she would come forward from behind the counter.....well think again, obviously there is no interest in what people think."
3,"Ok my personal breakfast choices in Charlotte are either here, Denny's, or IHOP. This place is always packed on Saturdays and the food and service is great. There are plenty of items on the menu for people to choose from which is great. The omlettes are HUGE! And this is not an understatement either. Two or three people can probably share it and it would be enough. \n\nIf you want to try a great b-fast place other than IHOP or Denny's...come here and you will not be disappointed"
4,Everyone here is wonderful.  Make no mistake this is no nationwide vision or Lenscrafters.  The doctors hear are very knowledgeable and down to earth.  I drive 45 minutes to go here.
1,"I went to celebrate one of my friends birthday dinner and I so disappointed. Never again will I be going eating at this restaurant. \n\nTo start off they have no parking lot so you have to park on the side of the street or wherever you can find parking and walk up to the restaurant. \n\nSecond because we were a huge group of 11 ppl we asked them several times to group two tables together (which we had made reservations days in advance) they didn't do it until they saw us trying to move the tables together. \n\nThird the menu wasn't that great. I was expecting lots of tacos, burritos, more Mexican dishes and the prices were ridiculous, I guess because it's Scottsdale. The lowest price for a plate was 14.99 which by the way while reading the menu the food did sound that delicious/appealing. I can say that the green enchilada was really good. I had the tequila lime salad and added chicken. The chicken was so dry and had no flavor. As much as I tried to finish it after awhile I had to stop eating. Margaritas were expensive and the alcohol amount in them were small. The beers were pretty cheap 4.25 though. \n\nFourth, the decor was pretty decent. Nothing too fancy we sat outside in the patio they had fans and misters which was pretty nice however they had this fireplace in the middle which I did not understand. Inside the restaurant is pretty ghetto looking for being in Scottsdale. Bathrooms were clean but really small, I felt so cram in the stall. The bar was alright but it looked dirty. The bottles on the wall looked they haven't dust them in months. \n\nFinally, the server was good he seemed really awkward and nerves. I know we were a large group and did a good job getting us drinks and our food correctly. Until the end when we were about to pay we ask to split up the tabs and he said he couldn't. After that we got irritated. We spent 30 mins trying to figure out who ordered what totaling the amounts each person owed and several ppl were paying in cash while others with their cards and what amount of change certain ppl were going to get back. We pretty much had to wait an hr to figure that out and for the server to figure it out. Not to mention that my bf and I had to pay our tab plus the gratuity tip because we were the last ones. What should have been a tab of $53 they charged us $67 (wtf). \n\nDidn't have a good experience I doubt I will ever return."
0,"Arrived at 7:05 and ordered. It is now 7:35 and  still no food. There are only a handful of patrons in here. Everyone that came in and ordered a smoothie was served within minutes, but for some reason it takes well over 30 minutes to make a salad and a sandwich? Awful. They can handle a lunch rush but not a drizzle of evening customers? Not coming back."
1,"I really liked the environment/atmosphere at Peculiar Rabbit, but the food was average and the menu was limited.  I feel like this place does not really have an identity yet.\n\nBasically, I don't feel an urge to come back here for anything more than some beers."
2,"In my search for great BBQ this place stands out.  Not only is it tasty but it doesn't irritate my stomach.  That is a major plus in my book.  The one drawback is service.  I've ordered online and arrived at the specified pick up time 30-60 minutes later to still have to wait another 15-20 minutes.  So be advised to just go to the take out counter and order, as it will take just as long."
1,"Waited 45 minutes for a salad? Our server didn't check on us and we had little ones with us. The kitchen was backed up... It is a restaurant right, it's what you do? \nToo bad, we have given this place a chance and every time the service is lacking. Go when you have plenty of time and aren't hungry, it takes a long time to get your food."
3,"A big menu and most of the food is pretty solid. They brew their own beer on site, and my favorites are the Stone of Scone Scotch Ale and Crop Circle Wheat. This is a good place to take a big group of people and is in a cool historic building. I highly recommend eating on the patio, it's really nice."
0,Let me start by saying that I wouldn't recommend there services here.they charge you for everything I booked my wedding on May 9 th unfortunately we can't get married here so I canceled they said they can't refund my depost because of the service they had to do planning all I did was email questions and I didn't have a big package I had the simplicity package it's not much to it. I would be happier getting married at a courthouse then here
2,"I like the atmosphere of Giant Coffee a lot: high ceilings, an open and industrial decor, with soft cushioned benches along the walls and 2 long tables down the center of the room. Baristas were very friendly but not forcibly chatty, and my iced coffee was very good. Nice depth of flavor, low acidity, and no stale taste.\n\nI am only giving 3 stars, however, because of the price. It's no wonder the place is barely a quarter filled, even with the positives I listed above. More than $4 for a 16oz iced coffee that would cost at least a dollar less almost anywhere else. It's worth it, I suppose,  if you're going to stay and enjoy the WiFi and decor, and do some studying or something; but if you're just passing through, it's a bit of a steep price. I get that they're placing a premium on a product that is, admittedly, superior to most iced coffees in the area... but with competitors like Lux and Jobot close by, it seems a bit odd.\n\nThe good news is that the other coffee drinks (lattes, cappuccinos, hot coffee) seem more regularly priced. I think I'll come back, but only if I have the time to stay and enjoy the place a bit."
3,Nothing like an Iced Almond milk Extra Dirty Chai to get this day started!!!!  A must try here.....
3,"Had dinner here tonight. It was great! I enjoyed the ballantyne roll, surf n turf roll and the spicy katsu chicken roll.I ordered a side of miso soup and had kikkokomen plum wine. Yummy! Check out their menu for the roll ingredients. I was so hungry I forgot to take pics.If you are a sushi connoisseur like myself you might think the menu is a little commercial, but it's a great place to take a newbie sushi eater. There is something good to eat for everyone, no matter what their taste buds desire,even vegans. Check it out you wont be disappointed. Since it's Friday I expected them to be packed, but they weren't and i got my food in less than 15 minutes. My server Allison was great and she knew the menu and best tasty choices. The men who prepared my meal also greeted me and asked how I liked every thing."
2,"We were greeted as soon as we got into the restaurant and got to choose our table.  Our waitress was a trainee, which it would be all right, if she would have been shadowed or supervised by an experienced waiter/waitress.  She made a couple of errors, that would have given management an excellent coaching moment, but they were not there.  One of those mistakes she made was when she told me that I had a strong accent and she didn't understand me.  I certainly have a strong accent, but there are ways of clarifying without being rude.  Later on I just, nicely told her about it.  That was one of many.\n\nNo one came to our table to ask how we were doing or to check on the poor thing, she was young and certainly inexperienced.  I don't blame her, management should be helping these new trainees.  That's why they are there.\n\nFood was great though."
2,"Charlotte Douglas International Airport is a complete madhouse, but the cuisine is off the chains. \n\nI had a lay over here and was shocked at the sheer volume for a small market city. You would be forgiven if you mistook this airport for LAX or ORD, it is that busy. Huge lines and very few charging areas for your cell phone will frustrate even a seasoned traveler. \n\nThe food choices however are commendable. If you are hungry you owe it to yourself to seek out Carolina Pit Barbecue in the main terminal as it is the damn truth. Smoky, tender and so moist... truly delicious. A small piece of heaven in a travelers hell."
3,Staff here is extremely friendly. Starbucks inside is great to get before shopping. Better than most Targets I have been to.
3,"I like Cibo better than Bianco as a restaurant, but Chris's pie is still better by a nose. Cibo has bad parking, nice ambience, spotty service, good menu, fresh, high quality ingredients, and good value. Translates to hit the off hours, get a pie, order the antipasto, and have a Nutella desert"
1,Hey I went into this place after reading all the raving reviews.... gotta say was disappointed with the people in it. I walked in and their doors have a chime to let them know ... someone came up to see and did not even say hello nothing. Then 3 to 4 minutes later another patron walks in young blond etc and I suddenly hear him greet her and ask if she would like any help. He also asked another lady who was in the same room if she needed help..\nThese 2 men walked around and not once was i asked for assistance. I am in the healing industry and was very keen to purchase some items....\nThe store was not as impressive as it was made out. And if you are in the business of selling these items keep an open heart and a welcoming presence.
0,"Seriously the worst Starbucks ever. Not only are they \""not\"" aloud to take/scan a Starbucks card off of a phone, but they didn't know anything about the drinks they're making. Stating that \""we can't make Christmas drinks in a tall size.\"" When every other Starbucks does. It's disappointing to see such a great company have such a terrible store."
3,You definetly get your fill for the price. The flavors here are good but not great. Definetly worth it if you have a craving for Mediterranean and dont want to fix it at home. Not bad though. Will give it another shot when I get another craving. Lol
3,"This is my crafting paradise. Whether you are decorating, sewing, painting or whatever, this is the best place. It's so clean and neat. I never have a hard time finding what I want. The staff is friendly and they always have great sales here. You can even go online and download coupons.  I prefer this place over Michael's. Their prices and selection are way better."
4,"The music is a little too loud, but their food is so good. Their burger with the lobster and asparagus is my favorite meal on the menu. Love it!"
1,"Stayed here for a short weekend holiday.  Rooms were good size, easy to get to and clean.  I did not like having to leave my room for coffee, no coffee makers in the room.  It is located right across from the MGM Grand which was the site for our concert, so in that regard the location was great."
3,"Not an incredibly 'outdoorsy' type guy but I have to say I like this place.  With tons of activities there is always something to keep you entertained.  On my most recent visits, my girlfriend and I hiked the trails and it was a nice break from our normal routine.  Be careful of the bikes while on the trails, sometimes you just have to jump out of the way!  The other visit was on a Thursday night when they have live music and honestly I loved it.  It's a different crowd than your typical Alive After Five type.  Much more laid back and I prefer it.  I will definitely be back!"
2,"I have been to Seasons a lot over the years. It's always pretty solid and they usually have great local deals, which is usually what draws me in. \n\nOn this occasion I had friends in from out of town who were in desperate need of AYCE food. I suggested Seasons and off we went. We got in line (which was scarily long) and started to wait. We heard rumblings of a free buffet offer and took turns to go to the Rewards Club  booth to sign up. My fella and I already had cards, but we got free buffets and $5 in slot play for signing up newbies, score!\n\nIt took us an hour and a half to get through the line and everyone was getting pretty antsy in line. My friends had a show to get to, so each passing minute was making them nervous about leaving on time. We finally got seated and off they went to scrounge around for a plate of food before they had to run off. The food is always pretty solid for buffet food but I had to deduct a star for slow service and the long line. They did deal with it the best they could as the servers and the rest of the staff were obviously overwhelmed with large amount of people filtering in and out because of the promotion. They definitely need to account for this and staff more people on the weekends.\n\nAll in all, a solid buffet that I usually suggest to friends and family when they're looking for good food on the cheap. Bets of all, they have chocolate covered strawberries. I know, the simple pleasures."
1,"I used to LOVE Freddy's.  We started going when we were in Texas on vacation and then the opened this location and WOW...we had a favorite.\n\nWe have been to this location several times and the location in Gilbert twice.  It used to be that EVERY time we went it was AMAZING!!  Now, it is hit or miss.  Last visit to this location the fries were WAY overcooked...quality control would tell you not to send out burnt fries, but no they sent them right out to us.  I think the little burger has shrunk and it was small before.  \n\nOuch, why is it that when you start to really love a place it goes downhill?  Well, at least In & Out burger stays consistant and since I now live in SoCal I guess we won't be missing Freddy's anymore."
4,"Love Big Dog Coffee! I am a huge fan of the oatmeal bar, iced coffee and iced lattes. I normally visit this spot everyday before work (oatmeal and iced coffee). \n\nThe interior space is beautiful, sort of a anthropologie feel to it. A lot of eclectic pieces with out looking like a cheesy TGI Fridays. Also the patio area has charming wrought iron furniture for the occasional nice day in Pittsburgh. \n\nPro: really friendly staff, oatmeal bar, sunny interior, great coffee\nCon: Oatmeal bar can be a bit pricey( although the serving is huge), could use a couple more comfy cars. \n\nOverall: Great place for studying, reading, first date and people watching!"
1,"This place, is just a waste of time and money. I came to meet a friend here, so we decided to do AYCE. There were a few things on the menu that they had to charge us $1 extra (orange blossom and XXX roll) the fish didn't taste at all fresh to me. There wasn't anything I ate that was a factor to where I would have came back for. They don't do half orders, and they charge extra on top of the AYCE prices. Sorry Kobe, there's way too many sushi places for me to choose from. This will definitely be my first and last trip here."
4,"This is the best gym I have ever been too. Clean, big, and has a lot of new equipment. They offer a lot of services too like private training, nutrition planning, and massage/chiropractor.\n\nThere are about 5 to 10 machines for the muscle you want to work out so you almost never have to wait to use a machine. There is also a boxing ring with free to use boxing bags which was a huge deal for me. \n\nTo top it all off, they have a really nice locker room with plenty of lockers, space, and privacy. \n\nThe employees are young, and polite. My only complaint is that the snack bar is a bit expensive. I'd like to use it more after my workouts but I can't swing a $5 protein smoothie when I have my own stuff at home."
3,"We had a TCBY on campus at college, so when I found that they are now self serve I was surprised!...very similar to Menchies/YoForia... But glad, i like to pick a few different flavors and have the amount that I choose.  They have great flavor and topping choices.  \nEverything still tastes the same as i remember, but now you self-serve.\n\nI didn't like that they don't have the tiny taste-tester cups like at the other Fro-Yo places- you never know if you are going to like a flavor based on the name!"
1,This counter inside Macys I needs to train their employees a little better. I went into the store to get a few items for my freelance kit. A nice young lady helped me with the products and the person behind the counter is where my experience went down hill.. The nice young lady put my things behind the counter and I continued to browse to see if I wanted anything else while she applied makeup to someone else. When I was done I waited in line to pay for my things and when it was my turn the person behind the counter had an nasty attitude as if I was not going to buy anything. ( I was dressed in my work uniform)  I asked about a future collection that knew was coming out  and the person acted as if  they knew nothing so I'm like I already know it's coming out you don't have to lie. After that I asked for another item to add and when they thought that was all I was purchasing the attitude was even nastier. They were even talking and laughing with someone at the other counter while I was asking about a product. Then when I said all those other things are mine as well the whole attitude changed after I purchased over 200 dollars... I felt like I was be discriminated against by this person. If I didn't really need the products for a project I would have left them right there. I will never go back to this one again!!! The pro shop is way better it is busy but the customer service way better
0,"I would never recommend this \""school\"" to anyone. The teachers are rude and unprofessional. They don't want their students to succeed. All of these teachers are the ones fired from other schools. This is no the nursing program, but I'm sure the whole school is like this. Go to a real school like asu, gcu, or the community college. This will be a waste of your time and money; two things I don't like to waste. The education is very poor. After graduating from ASU and paying a fraction of the cost it is a much better education."
2,"I hate Vegas clubs but why do I always end up at them!? I really don't know! There is always somebodys bday or friend in town, blah blah. Ok so this time it was my friend's cousin in town and someone's bday, etc etc. Point is I ended up here. \n\nAfter my horrible experience here 2 yrs ago on my bday I promised to never return. I guess I lied to myself. 2 yrs ago it was all girls and 2 guys, all the girls could get in no problem and free, but the guys we did not want to leave them behind and they did not want to pay the big bucks to get in quickly so we ended up waiting, in a long lone (very) long line. took freakin forever to get in and when inside it was HOT and gross in there.\n\nSo this past weekend we went. We were put on the guest list. There was a long line for general admission, long line for girls, and an area for the \""guest list\"" which was not a line, just a bunch of people ( I would say at least 100 people) smashed up against eachother-did not move for 30 minutes. So refusing to wait in line we talked to bouncers, they said we needed to \""find a way to the front\"" if we had guys with us. If it was us girls only, he would let us in. OMG! Why do I keep going with guys!? why?!\n\nSo we decided to get bottle service. $1,000 for 2 bottles and a section to sit down. It was a totally different experience than standing the entire night. My feet really thanked me. We got really lucky though! They were filming Keeping up with the Kardashians that night and so we got to see all the Kardashian sisters up close and personal in our section of the Pussycat Dolls Lounge. Also got to see Pussycat Dolls perform. Pure gets 3 stars for good music and the celebrities I got to see up close.\n\nBut the main area with dancefloor, can we get any more crowded. I had to practically molest people to get by. Someone slap me the next time I am talked into Pure."
3,"I will say this. This is against anyone who says \""The shuttle waits too long\""...Its this and that. Look, if you don't want to pay $6 for a SHARED VAN SERVICE...then go and spend the expensive hourly luxury cars per hour. Look. This is a very clean bus, more like a party bus without all the bells and whistles but it sure does not come close to a rink, clattering competitors shuttle. Their reps from start to end were very helpful and courteous and this was at 7am! Bright and early.\n\nAll and all, I have found the company I will use for all of my LAS needs. I recommend this company to anyone who wan"
3,My SO and I went last night for dinner. We had the Dan Dan Noodles which I really enjoyed. It had the right amount of vinegar and peanut flavors. We had it with the small noodles.  We had the pork soup dumplings which was amazing as always. The waiter did an awesome job of explaining the proper way to eat them. We had the beef and tendon soup which was supposed to be spicy but wasn't as spicy as we wanted :(.
1,The two times I went in there the customer service was HORRIBLE and would not go back for that reason.
0,"Had the same issue with the 45 minute prior check-in.  I heard of such a thing being 30 minutes prior to check-in due to security reasons, we were at the 35 minute point so they definetely said no.  Their computers had already siezed up is what we were told, a security measure...federal rules to be exact.  Funny cuz Allegiant does no such thing.\n\nSo we were stuck in Reno for the night and got the next flight out, said my buddies bag was to large for the over head compartment, yet it was fine on the arrival.  So he had to pay.  The couple in front of us had a bag that weighted 51 pounds, 1 pound over and gave them grief.  The lady freaked out and started taking out shoes and clothes and shoving it in carry ons.  I don't blame her, 1 pound over really?  They don't know what customer satisfaction is, I'll stick with Southwest and Allegiant thanks !"
0,"Terrible service and food.\n\nI ordered veal meatballs and pasta. The veal was cold on the inside and I was never offered parmesan or fresh pepper. \n\nService is slow and of the 3 waitreses that served our little section, none of them came to ask if everything was ok.\n\nThey took away our dishes and didn't offer us a dessert menu. We had time so we waited to see if they'll acknowledge us. 15 min later...one of them came by. \n\nWould not recommend."
1,"Ok ... I'm a big crab leg snob! But I was super disappointed in waiting for dinner and paying more for iced soaked frozen tasteless crab legs. They didn't even try to hide the fact they were frozen by having the boxes of them next to the buffet. So I would recommend lunch only!\n\nOn the plus side, sushi selection and flavor was great. Probably had over 20 varieties of sushi to select from.  They also had \""okay\"" customer service - nothing to write home about. \n\nOverall, glad I didn't pay full price for dinner. And probably wouldn't go back for dinner."
0,This place is slow
1,"I have never stayed at the Eastside Cannery  -- or even insomuch as gambled here -- so, I was reluctant to leave a review. I have only come here for shows and events. So, this review will be based on the Eastside Events Center, which does not -- as of the date of this writing -- have a listing on Yelp, and probably zero existing reviews in the more general Eastside Cannery listing.\n\nThe Eastside Events Center is not much of an events centre. It is located in a small ballroom on the second floor of the hotel - casino. Typically, when I think events centre, I imagine a separate structure resembling more of an arena than a bingo hall.\n\nIn any case, the box office is actually located at the front desk, which is the queue one would get into on the night of events for tickets. To be clear: there is a small area to the right of front desk where the \""Box Office\"" signage is located, but one just gets in the regular, general front desk queue in order to get serviced. All windows will help you with your ticketing.\n\nOnce the tickets are squared away, you have a few dining options, and there is also a temporary bar that gets set up before the merch/swag and doors (show - speak for entrance to venue).\n\nLighting is absolute shit for shows (concerts). Sound is about as good as it is going to get in a room not designed for live music. Assigned seating events is all I have experienced here.\n\nOne very nice touch is the complimentary hearing protection at the table where they scan you in. In and outs are permitted. (They stamp your hand.) The restrooms are clean and well stocked. There is a pleasant minty scent that fills the air when one urinates into the urinal. \n\nThere are even water fountains -- or bubblers (if you are Bostonian) -- right outside doors, or the area you reach the platform upon stepping off the escalator. There are couches near the restrooms, and seating all along the area outside doors or the bingo (hall) across the hall (from the events centre that resembles a bingo hall.) \n\nBingo!"
1,Not that good. I've had better burgers at Jack In The Box
4,Amazing food! Really enjoyed the complexity of these dishes.  Very unique and the service was fantastic.  I'll definitely return here again!
4,"I have been twice now and each time it just gets better and better.  I love their garlic edamame and their seaweed salad, so delicious!  But the kicker is their Paitan Ramen OH MY GAWD!!!  The broth is rich and beautiful and just has amazing flavor and the noodles are perfectly cooked with a little but of bite and combined with the vegetables and oh you have to add a tea egg - perfection in a bowl! triple yum"
2,"The only reason I am giving this place a 3 star review is because the service was excellent. The waitress was very friendly and gave us the perfect mix of attention and privacy. We were seated quickly, and had drinks a few minutes later. The food arrived equally fast.\n\nThe restaurant itself is your typical roadhouse. Its dark and a bit crowded feeling inside, with lots of stuff on the walls, and feels dirty, even though I'm sure it's clean. Prices were reasonable, especially considering the huge portions of food. I ordered their \""famous\"" Chicken fried steak. I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, but what I got was not what I was hoping for. the breading on the chicken wasn't very crispy and had very little flavor. The gravy had even less flavor than the batter and only succeeded in making everything soggy. The steak itself was cooked well but fatty, flavorless, and hard to cut. the salads and side dishes were equally mediocre. \n\nNothing special about TexAZ Grill."
2,"Nice Italian restaurant for a simple lunch or dinner. Flavors are good, service is OK and quick but this is not an upscale restaurant it is instead a neighborhood place that is OK.\nIf you are a student or professor at UNC Charlotte it is one of the better places for lunch in the area."
3,"I love this place! I have a problem with their crappy customer service via their website and how they don't allow long ranting complaints (which I have, but will set aide). They have a text limit, so when I wrote my awesome e-mail from my phone to send, at the end, it said their website couldn't process my complaint at the time... I tried from my computer writing a new e-mail (since the other one was erased), but that one wouldn't submit either. Then I sent a 1 word e-mail. Hey! That went through! Apparently, they want to hear your comments, just not long ones. My friend also wrote an e-mail stating that she wanted to set up a PARTY to come to this theater. No reply. I'd say they should improve that. Moving on to the awesomeness.\n\nFULL sized reclining chairs. They are comfy and lush, and actually served as a nice nap area when Epic (Disney's attempt at making an epic movie) got boring. I love their reserved seating option (which doesn't work on the mobile version, so make sure to click on full site, or book from a computer). The people who work here seem to really like their job and I like the usher that tells jokes while we're waiting for the previews. Ticket prices are the same if not lower than others. I took my kids here and they were in love. Now when I'm sitting at another movie theater, I just wish I could be reclining instead. I am definitely a fan, even after I let them eat up $30 for Ironman 3D on top of my other Ironman movie tickets (I paid a total of $54 to watch Ironman 3. It wasn't worth it). Come! Reserve your seats so it doesn't matter if you're late. Bring a blankie. Enjoy!"
3,This place has amazing deals! There 50% off all rolls for the summer is divine! Not the greatest sushi in town but for the price and the experience A in my book! \n\nMy friend got a cucumber roll and the presentation was out of this world and fun! Think rave flashing light fun! We spent so much time taking pics of the food. For sure a fun friend event! \n\nNew regular affordable sushi place! Thought about going back again the next day because I drive past everday coming home from work!
4,"Took my car in for a repair a few years ago. This time I needed some major work done and seemed to remember a great, honest experience from years ago, so I figured I would try them again. I was not disappointed. Great customer service, very fair pricing, professional, courteous...I will only consider them for all repair needs in the future. Highly recommended!"
0,"My family and I were flying from Austin, TX to Phoenix (final destination was Anchorage, AK) on June 28th. We had our 12 year old daughter, who suffers from a brain malformation schizencephaly, with us. She requires a wheelchair to get around in and we gate checked it in Austin. There were two tags placed on the chair. One was for the gate check itself, the other was the full itinerary. When we arrived in Phoenix, my husband saw the ground crew take our daughters wheelchair and place it in a vehicle. Well, when you gate check something, you get it when you get to the next city. Not so much with US Air!! Now, they decided that the wheelchair was going to go directly to our next gate. We had a 4 hour layover in PHX. 4 hours of carrying my 12 year old, 66 pound daughter around. Yeah, I don't think so. So when I asked our flight attendant she quickly jumped at 'we can't speak with the ground crew\"" then proceeded to get herself ready to deplane. We took all of our stuff, including our other 2 daughters and my 12 year olds car seat, up to first class where we waited for the ground crew to bring my daughters wheelchair up. 10 minutes later, we were asked to deplane so they could get the plane ready for the next batch of passengers. We waited for about another 10-15 minutes in the terminal waiting for them to bring me her chair. When we finally got the chair, the lady was very rude saying \""Here's your chair\"" then walking off. I will never fly US Air with my daughter again. This was completely unprofessional and unbelievably rude."
0,"This is the second time I have ordered from this place.  The first time wasn't great... Pizza came barely warm and had way too much cheese, my cookie dessert was slightly burned but the ice cream was still cold and intact.  We also got the Carmel crunch cake, which came freezing cold, hence it was probably frozen to begin with but decent.  Since it was a first time order, I gave them a break.  I ordered the exact same thing tonight and was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED... My pizza came so cold and had so much cheese on it that when I tried to pull a slice off, the mound of cheese stuck to the other piece and fell completely off... It looked like a congealed cold mess.  The crust is NOT New York style, it's just regular hand tossed.  You can't fold it like New York style pizza should... I thought for sure after the pizza drama that I could count on the cookie... Nope!  The ice cream was completely melted, it was just milky liquid.:(. And again a cold piece of Carmel crunch cake.  This place sucks.  Don't waste your money.  I couldn't even eat the pizza it was so cold and gross... Maybe if my boyfriend was here he could heat it up for breakfast because he will eat anything... More like \""Streets of Domino's Cheap Nasty Pizza\"".... Actually I bet Domino's or Pizza Hut would at least deliver a hot pizza.... Get it together folks."
2,"Auch wenn es sicher eine willkommene Erfrischung auf der Sonntagswanderung war: soo au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich gut wie die lange Schlange suggerierte, die sich diesen Nachmittag vor dem B\u00fcdchen in der Gr\u00f6tzinger Pampa gebildet hatte fand ich das Eis jetzt gar nicht  gr\u00f6\u00dfere Kugeln und Auswahl hab ich anderswo auch schon gesehen. Eis Kaiser gef\u00e4llt mir besser"
4,I go to Cassie every time I'm in that side of town or go out of my way to go there she has always done an amazing job I trust her with my eyebrows it's a clean and friendly environment
4,This was a fantastic experience.!    Eric Schultz was a great host.  The beef carpachio was excellent.   The service was as good as the food.   Family owned and operated.   We had a 6 course meal for two on our anniversary and the cost before tip was 140.
1,"Unfortunately for me, I had the bad luck of coming here twice in one night.  The first was for a late dinner.  We ordered from the Chinese Menu.  For some reason, all the Chinese food I've ever had in Vegas casinos suck ass.  Even Panda makes better food than this.  We both got two different noodle soups.  They weren't horrible, but they definitely weren't very good.  Both had a salty soup broth that had a slightly odd taste that I cannot describe.  Later that night, around 3 a.m., we had to wait at least fifteen minutes for a table and another half an hour for our food.  You would think they'd know by now to hire more help during the after clubbing hours, but I guess not.  I had the nachos, which were cold and gross.  The chicken noodle soup had no chicken.  Someone ordered biscuits and gravy, which also came cold.  The only plate that was decent was the spam, rice, and eggs bc that one is almost impossible to screw up.  I gave it an extra star for the convenience of being open 24/7 and having a variety items on the menu to choose from (although if they all taste like crap, what is the point?)."
4,"Amazing team!!! Dr Resnick would do anything to respond to your every needs, even if it is calling you back from his vacation because you have to get in by a deadline. They always make it work!!! \nMy 1st appointment, I had to go in for an emergency, I left a voicemail at 3am, they called me back right away I was in by 7am. They also check on you afterwards to make sure you are feeling ok.\n Dr. Resnick and his staff are awesome, friendly, professional and they DO care! \nIt's not about selling you this or that, or try to make $$$ over your misery... They work really hard to make sure that you only pay what you need to pay.\nI love my dentist... It says it all!"
1,"The calamari is fab.  My wife liked her trout dinner a lot?   My fish and chips were very average.  The reason for the two stars is that this large restaurant shares on out door rest room with Restaurant North.  It is way too small for both places and in the 10-15 times I have been there it is filthy, out o.f soap, out of drying paper and usually has paper and trash all over the floor.  After all the years these places have been open I can't  believe this still exists.\nSam Fox needs to get .on this.  It is disgusting!"
4,"It's a five star review: this place has what it takes to knock it out the park and I hope they meet your expectations of a swanky gastropub if you should pay them a visit. Some of the beers are a little pricey, but supply and demand is what it is and I'm only referring to some of the bottled offerings there. On tap is a good range and you won't go thirsty.\n\nA lot of new student accommodation has recently opened up just feet away - the prices may help maintain the ambience and slightly exclusive nature of The Fountain, but only time will tell.\n\nThe food is the star of the show though. Pick yourself a beef shin pie and that's what you'll be getting: a whole lotta beef, with a bit of shin in there too (surprisingly heavy is cow bone). No carrot filler, all bovine killer, in a delightful sauce that you can soak up with your mashed potato side.\n\nThe battered fish and chips will keep you filled up for days, but beware the starters for they are mighty in their proportions and may prevent you finishing your battered treat.\n\nThe staff are generally great too. This place is an asset to all Edinburgh, particularly on this side of town."
3,"I have been to Kincaid's for business and pleasure and all the times I have gone there, its been fantastic, classy, and delicious. Thumbs up!"
0,Very Poor Customer Service :(
2,"This place has really gone downhill in the last decade compared to what else is out there.  The hotel hallways and rooms are no different than your typical Holiday Inn on an interstate in the middle of nowhere in the U.S.   Casino is in good shape but when you stroll through Bellagio, Wynn, Venetian, etc. it's just not the same here.  Even the walkway to Paris lets you know how \""dated\"" Bally's is.\n\nOnly plus is the pool is decent and maybe the Sbarro breakfast downstairs is fast."
3,"We had originally attempted to come here a few months ago, but our friends decided it looked \""too cheap, dirty, and gross.\""  Ugh... we swore that we would come back next time we were out in the neck of the woods and I am really glad we did!  \n\nThe restaurant is located in an average looking strip mall and the interior is just as average.  That's fine by me though.  Like someone else said in their review, at least I can see where their priorities are.  I ordered the 2 meat combo with shrimp and crawfish tails.  It was served with my choice of side, and I went with the cole slaw.  I was surprised at how flavorful the cole slaw actually was.  The shrimp were big and their outsides were really crispy.  They were quite yummy.  There were tons of baby crawfish tails, battered and fried like the shrimp.  Those were also yummy and quite succulent.  I really really enjoyed my meal.\n\nIf you come here, don't make the mistake that I did and not notice the yummy seasoning on the table.  I didn't notice it until after I was full, but I sampled it, and it was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely come back here next time I am in the area."
3,Great burgers!!! Good drinks!! A little strange eating in a booth with sheriff Joe's picture though.
2,This was my second trip to this location and I noticed their salad bar had fewer items from before.  It was still very good but am disappointed that they seemed to have eliminated some items. I am not a big meat eater and came for the salad bar so I noticed these things. It was still really really good however.
0,"Caesar's Palace, you are the WORST hotel/casino that I've stayed at during my trips to Vegas.\n\nShort story:\n- Messed up our comps when confirmed they were available\n- Dirty band aid in our hotel bathroom\n- Broken faucets\n- No video roulette\n- Housemaid didn't replenish our bathroom toiletries after the first night\n\nLong story:\nMy boyfriend, a total rewards member was graciously comped 5 free nights plus food comps at any of the Caesar's properties. And without a doubt, Caesar's would be first on our list. When I booked the hotel, I was confirmed that the nights were free and the food comps were available. After a sickening flight, we were told that we did not make reservations under the same code and was not offered other comps as substitution. Disappointed, we went upstairs to check out our hotel room. After a quick tour, I stepped into the bathroom and there it lay. A DIRTY BAND AID. Just there. Laying. On the ground. I was appalled that this institution supposedly reputable and gorgeous had such a disgusting slip up. Furthermore, the faucets were broken. HOW DO YOU HAVE BROKEN FAUCETS THAT YOU DON'T BOTHER TO FIX? Then the cleaning lady didn't even bother to replenish our bathroom toiletries. The whole time at Caesar's was a disappointment. In all, Caesar's is nice on the outside and the casino floor. I wouldn't bother to come back to Caesar's to stay the night though."
4,"Let's just say - Pen & Teller were magical! (ba dum tsss!)\n\nWe luckily scored comped tickets with awesome seats for my boyfriend's birthday. We enjoyed the show so much, we would definitely buy tickets and watch them again in the future. Can you believe they've been performing at the Rio for 13 years! That's incredible and commendable. They are true Vegas entertainers. I love that they change up their acts and throw in new ones. We were very entertained, wow'ed and in awe like school kids - we thoroughly enjoyed the show!\n\nPenn also grooves out on the upright bass with Mike Jones before the show, so make sure to catch that - he's totally in his element and it's heartwarming.\n\nPenn & Teller are an amazing duo, they are really meant to be on stage together. They are both so lovable, funny, friendly, and super nice! I'm glad that they take the time to take pictures with each and every one of their guests after the show.\n\nNot to give out any detailed spoilers, these were my favorite tricks:\n- Penn & Teller's cell phone act\n- Teller & ball act\n- Teller & gold dollar coins \n- Penn & Teller's cow act\n\nI would say I had only 2 complaints:\n- Photos are prohibited during the show (whoops!)\n- It's freezing in the theatre, so definitely dress accordingly"
0,While the food and entertainment were good and a pleasant surprise - the service was so unbelievably horric it ruined our whole experience.  We went for dinner - 2 adults and 2 kids.  It took over 55 minutes to get a kids grilled cheese!  Our appetizer was served to us twice.  We brought up how long our meal was taking at least twice - and I was told *a manager will come over to talk with you and perhaps make an adjustment*.  We let our server know we wanted to make the 8pm show (our reservations were at 6:30pm).  Didn't order anything complicated that I thought we would be able to make it.  Guess what - after 35 minutes from being told mgr would come over - they never did.  Clearly - they didn't really care.  Finally - my husband and kids left to go see the show - we weren't able to finish our dinner - had to have our dessert wrapped up.  Server then said - you can always call us and we can try to make right by you?  I'm like - really - I get to spend more time giving feedback vs. you've now had 2 opportunities (both you and your manager) - to make this right when I am right here and you didn't think it was important enought?  And the best - kids meals include drinks - they charged us $3 EACH for a kiddy cocktail.  NEVER diclosed that was an upcharge.  \n\nIt was our first experience at Rawhide overall - and we were having a fantastic time - as we really had no idea what to expect and the kids loved it!  Our dinner experience completely ruined that - which is really a shame.
2,"8/11/13\n\nTreated BIL and two sisters to Under the Sun tour tonight.  Five bands from the 90s: Fastball http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/time-warner-cable-uptown-amphitheatre-charlotte-charlotte?select=RfNj5ybfKpJJbWPb0Djjow#RfNj5ybfKpJJbWPb0Djjow, Vertical Horizon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/time-warner-cable-uptown-amphitheatre-charlotte-charlotte?select=uu0AHwsRJNeJfqLjjmmmFA#uu0AHwsRJNeJfqLjjmmmFA, Gin Blossoms\n http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/time-warner-cable-uptown-amphitheatre-charlotte-charlotte?select=Z8xLBOjBZU9hbpfXpkL03g#Z8xLBOjBZU9hbpfXpkL03g, Sugar Ray (vocal Mark McGrath mentioned his vision of this lineup, so I assumed he organized it) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/time-warner-cable-uptown-amphitheatre-charlotte-charlotte?select=Zevu6onkEoU7bds_0uY8hg#Zevu6onkEoU7bds_0uY8hg, and Smash Mouth. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/time-warner-cable-uptown-amphitheatre-charlotte-charlotte?select=uJKwrXZuZA9HI4KemHAYIA#uJKwrXZuZA9HI4KemHAYIA\n\nWe all agreed that Vertical Horizon, Gin Blossoms (!!), and Sugar Ray (!!) performed the best (great energy and stage presence), and Smash Mouth was a HUGE letdown.  Lead singer Steve Harwell's vocal cords were shot-- the spoken bits of their songs sounded fine, but whenever he sang, his notes were all off-key.  (I attributed it to heavy touring all summer long, but I see that the first show was on July 4th...?)  It's a good thing most in attendance knew the words of \""All Star\"" word-for-word (but not me!), because Harwell didn't even need to be present!  He did a lot of walking from one end of the stage to the other, and holding his mike stand out over the audience during the number.  Don't get me wrong, SM played good music, but after Vertical Horizon, Gin Blossoms, and Sugar Ray's sets, Smash Mouth's was very anti-climactic.  I'd say the combo of the earlier bands' lively performances, Harwell's blown vocals, and the day's heat and humidity had drained us of energy by concert's end...  It was fun to see and hear band members moonlight on other bands' sets-- very cool.  (I enjoyed Fastball, but sisters and BIL weren't familiar with their songs, and so didn't care.  I just wished Fastball had put more effort in showing that they were happy to be there.)  \n\nShould you attend a concert of this magnitude, I suggest you arrive early!  Gin Blossoms' Robin Wilson invited everyone in attendance to move in closer to the stage by the second-half of their set, per amphitheatre's general director's discretion.  Yep, lawn seat ticket-holders moved into seats that others had paid upwards of $80 or more...  Two men almost duked it out two rows ahead of us-- guy and his date arrived late to claim their $75 seats, only to find lawn seat ticket holders standing their ground.  Hey, I'd feel the same way if someone wouldn't give me the seats I'd paid for.  (I paid $208, surcharges included, for four center row seats.)  There were other open seats available, many closer to the stage... Ah, well.\n\nBe sure to have your tickets with you should you need to use the restroom, or buy drinks at the concession stands, for you will need them to return to your seats.  Correction: we needed them, until the invite was given for the audience to move in closer, and then security and ushers left their posts.\n\np.s.  Compared to the Ak-Chin Pavilion (Phoenix, AZ; seats 20,000) I was at a few days before this event, this Charlotte arena is VERY SMALL (3,000 max capacity?; couldn't find much info online).  Still a nice venue, and I wouldn't mind catching another concert here in the future."
2,"Came here for the first time today. The food was great, but the servers were so slow and inattentive. Their pork sinigang reminded me of Lola's back in the PI. Lechon kawali was fried to perfection, non of it was over cooked and dry. The Bicol express had good flavor and a mild kick while the longanisa fried rice needed a touch of seasoning. My only problem with this place was the service. They are very SLOW! I would see them on their cell phones texting. After dropping the food off at the table, they never came back to refill our drinks or to check up on us. It took an additional 10-15 just to get the attention of our server to get to-go boxes and our check. I work in a restaurant, I know how it gets when it gets busy but dang, they weren't that busy. The girls were polite and friendly but they need to focus on their job. I still want to try this place a couple more times, I hope I get better service next time."
3,"I'm definitely an Apple fan! Thats all I have. In order for Apple to get 5 Stars it would take them offering better prices for their products & services. I understand everyone's gotta make money but dang they charge a lot sometimes. Can't review the tech support at this location but the store is always clean & the staff is knowledgeable about the products. Its a great place to bring your children when they are riding your nerves. They will infiltrate the store & keep themselves plenty occupied playing so you can catch your sanity. lol Almost as good as IKEA, now if we can just check them in here for a bit and go hide, hahahaha!"
1,"Nothing special, it is Kmart after all.  \n\nDeals are hard to come by, but you have to just look a little bit longer.  It is true that the employees really don't seem to care that they are at work.  I can relate, I did my time in retail.  Although I left it when my time was due.  \n\nGood for the area if you don't want to run to a nearby shopping area."
0,"This place is an absolute nightmare.  I'm in the market for a new gym, but this place won't be it. I arrived at Urban Active tonight at 6:10 and asked to be added to the spinning class list for 6:30.  \""Nope, it's full...you should really get here 40 minutes before the class starts\"".  Bwah?  Who has 40 extra minutes in their day? And they don't take phone signups, either.  I shrugged it off and went to an ab class.  I'm standing around, waiting, waiting, 10 minutes after the class was supposed to start we get called into a class - but wait! It seems like it's the tail end of another class.  We all do some planks and bicycle crunches. The other class ends and the instructor tells them to \""be sure to get here early for tomorrow's class; last time 70 (SHE SAID SEVENTY) people showed up.\""  After the class leaves, she turns to us, the ab class people, and says that....the class has been canceled. FOR A MONTH.  At this point I'm just in shock; I should have walked out.  Instead I tell the front desk and they're unfazed, and they assign me to a tour with Michelle.\n\nSo I go on my tour with Michelle, who informs me that my current gym is shit (it's not, it's just expensive - it's actually the best gym in the city, and the *only* place with a whirlpool and steam room for women.  It's the JCC, if anyone is curious). She insists it is shit again (I had no idea that spa style wooden lockers and more expensive equipment were shit), then becomes aggressive with me. I'm aware she's using a classic hyper-aggressive sales pitch, but I'm not taking her seriously.  At 645, when we started our tour, there was a line for treadmills and for ellipticals - oh, and I saw the line from the first floor, because Michelle never showed me the 2nd floor.  When I asked why there weren't more machines/it was so busy, she said \""oh, well you're better off coming during the day\"".  Riiiight, during the day!  Will she tell my boss I won't be making that 2pm meeting?  The locker rooms are very no-frills, and the personal training desk was so tacky that it had individual credit card machines front and center of every chair.  \n\nBut really, the icing on the cake (and by now, you're waiting for the juggernaut, aren't you?) was her casual anti-semitism.  Yep.  She said that \""dozens\"" of members of the JCC had been in today because it was closed.  \""What's up with being randomly closed all the time, we're only closed on Christmas!\"" boasts Michelle.  Well, Michelle, it's not Columbus Day or Thirsty Thursdays, which you seem to celebrate, it's actually the freaking Jewish New Year and the kickoff leading up to Yom Kippur.  Someone should probably tell Michelle that Christmas isn't a national holiday.\n\nJoin this gym if only you're looking for a hookup scene or to snag a new date, because it certainly has that in its favor."
1,"I could just copy & paste Tim J's review of this place (from a year & a half ago!), & it would be real close, but let me do my own, \""Good/Not So Good\"" account:\n\nThe good:\n\n*  It's nice inside, & I was able to plant myself in a comfortable booth for lunch.  Norm R. joined me, to run this place up against one of the Valley's best of these kinds of places, \""Pizza Buffet & Much, Much More\"" in North Phoenix.  I also kept Pizza Hut Buffet (48th St.), Amazing Jake's, CiCi's, Pep\u00e9's & Peter Piper in mind, in reviewing it.\n\n*  The salad bar is ok, having enough of the usual veggies to satisfy, & there were potato & macaroni salads that were ok.\n\n*  Disregarding grease, the flavor of the pizza was pretty good.\n\n*  Our server, an older lady who looked like she'd be more at home at (the great) Scott's Generations, was friendly & attentive.\n\nOk, let's get to the dirt:\n\n*  They have \""Rules.\""  Have you ever been to New Town Super Buffet in Burbank, CA?  \""$20.99 extra charge if you eat the fish off the sushi & don't eat all the rice.\""  \""$20.99 extra charge if you don't eat all the food on your plate.\""  \""$20.99 extra charge if you take a plate of any one thing.\""  Ok, it wasn't quite as bad as THAT, but it was, in so many words, NO YOU CAN'T COME OVER TO THIS SIDE OF THE SERVING TABLE WHERE IT'S MORE CONVENIENT TO GET YOUR PIZZA THAT'S IN THE BACK!  NO, YOU CAN'T GET YOUR OWN ICE CREAM CONE FOR DESSERT!  You get the idea.\n\nThen there was the pizza.  There was some cheese bread, some garlic bread, & several pizzas out.  The pizza choices consisted of cheese, cheese with a dab of something else, pepperoni, sausage, & pepperoni & sausage.  Nothing else, really, except that you could special order \""taco pizza\"" or, can you imagine?, SAUERKRAUT pizza!  HOLY S#*@T, & you thought Spam Lo Mein was weird!\n\nThere was so much grease floating around on the top of the pizza slices that you could roll one up from side to side, aim it at your friend (in this case Norm R.), & squirt it out the bottom at them like milking a cow!\n\n*  The coup de gr\u00e2ce to this place was the outrageous price!  I called ahead, & they told me $8.50 including soft drink & a soft-serve cone, which is ridiculous for a pizza buffet.  Then, when I arrived here, hungry & 21 miles from home, I was advised that they have just jacked the price up to $9.25 for all adults!  HOLY S#*@T AGAIN!  Even if the pizza WASN'T all greasy, the maximum price, including drink & no-you-can't-get-it-yourself soft serve ice cream cone, should be $6.25.  Even then, it wouldn't be as good overall as Pizza Buffet, where the same amount of choice costs $4.99/$3.99 Senior!\n\nTwo Stars, period."
2,"I live nearby this place and have had MANY bagels over the years. Over time, my standards have changed and I now get them rarely. These are not as good as a New York bagel. The texture just isn't right and the bread doesn't have the kind of flavor you get with well fermented doughs. \n\nIf you need to get something for an office with 25 people, this is a good cheap option. But for a bread fix, there are better options."
2,"Not worth the $110 per person. Yes - including tip. All I can really remember was the Kobe beef which was first way overcooked - but they send out another order gratis. Eventually it was delicious but not a '10'.\n\nThe service was great. Our waiter was young, funny and accommodating. We kept ordering drinks after food after drinks etc. We also had plenty of questions for our \""pain in the ass\"" friends.\n\nThe other food we ordered - hamachi, beef carpaccio, crispy rice w/ tuna, rock shrimp etc. It was good no doubt but in the end after spending $110 each we were not full and the food was not spectacular."
2,"Stocking all manner of novelty items, Gimme Gizmo is the kind of place you would make an impulse buy, be entertained by your purchase for approximately 5 minutes and then ponder why you even bought it in the first place.\n\nHaving said that, many of the items are good for stocking fillers or if you're looking for something silly for a Secret Santa or the like. \n\nAs soon as you walk in, you're always greeted by some kind of flying contraption or walking, talking mechanical dog that usually has a crowd gathered around it. \n\nAs the other reviewers have mentioned, as well as innocent items they also stock things of a more adult nature if you're in the market for such things."
4,"Of course I hiked up the Cholla trail in September.  I didn't know what to expect.  I don't think I had the right shoes to wear for this hike.  You'll need good traction if you intend to hike up the entire mountain (which is basically rock-climbing after you reach \""Helipad Plateau\"".  Be careful, the nice views show a reminder of your early death if you fall off of the mountain from fainting of dehydration or not having a strong enough grip when hugging the mountain.\n\nFIVE STAR!  This hike was so much fun!"
1,"In a word...yuk. Ordered takeout. If you like frozen pizza taste with a cardboard crust and canned sauce this is your place. Maybe kids would like it, but not adults who have ever eaten a good pizza."
2,Slow internet connection. No coffee available downstairs (constantly out). Breakfast was gross. Room was clean so that was a plus. But as a business traveler coffee and internet are foundation.
0,"If I had the option to put zero stars... this would be it... I'm really disappointed about wasting my time going through traffic just to check out this place that doesn't deserve to be called a buffet.  They make Hometown Buffet look like its 5 stars!!!  Upon arriving, thank goodness I was able to bypass the long line with my Total Rewards Platinum Card... It was very unusual that they didn't have a special wait area that immediately had a host service you... It was such a joke because to consider this place is Caesar's Palace!  Harrahs should really do something about this because this could be a turning point when you won't see people come back and put a bad name to it!  I did purchase the 24 hour buffet and thought Planet Hollywood was ok... Paris was not great in service... I will specify in another post for that place... Now I understand why upon arriving outside the entrance a group of guys stormed out of there saying out loud and warning people that it was terrible not to waste your time and money.  I really felt sorry for those people who were standing in line for that!  Lets just say your kitchen is probably bigger than what they had goin on there... The food was bland... no variety... almost felt like I was selecting food from a hospital cafeteria...no joke and I'm not exaggerating either!  Take my advice and anyone that has complained... do not waste your time go directly to the RIO Carnival Buffet... 2nd if you have to Planet Hollywood is ok... unless you have platinum or diamond , seven stars membership be prepared to be in a long line... Or take someone that has access to walk thru VIP... Hmmm why didn't I go on yelp to check the reviews before wasting my time here...ummm never again!!!"
3,First they brought out bread.  The bread was good however it was cold and not warm which is a minus.  the second thing I ordered was the butternut squash soup which was incredible and I highly recommend. Next I had the mahi-mahi fish tacos the mango salsa on top made them very good.  The only disappointment was the side slaw salad which virtually has no taste I had to finally add salt to find if there was any flavor or not
4,"Seriously. Best burgers in town. The black burger is BOMB! Without that cajun remoulade, it's delicious, but with it, FREAKIN' FANTASTIC! The fresh house made potato chips are like crack with the black truffle sea salt they use. My heart was almost broken when they were sold out of chips, but the server (also the owner) said they could add the crack...erm... salt.. to the house cut fries. Wasn't quite the same, but it was still very tasty. Service isn't always super friendly, but I don't care when I get the best burger and chips in town. The burgers aren't the only good part. They have daily specials that have always been satisfying and unique. They also have some stellar dark beers. Wait time can be a little long depending on when you come, but it's worth the wait."
3,"I think this would have been a five star if we'd have had the nachos and a cheeseburger. As it was, we shared a club and the teriyaki chicken. It was decent.\n\nBut let's face it-we came for the ambiance, the music and the BOOZE-and margaritaville did not disappoint! I say drink first - eat after."
0,"Completely lackluster experience for a very high price.\n\nI came here for a resurfacing facial and the raved about \""Orange Blossom\"" pedicure. I was super excited and was expecting nothing short of perfection for the price.\n\nWhen I had called to book my appointment a few weeks prior, I was told my 30 min facial would be at 3pm and my pedicure would be at 3:45pm. That was perfect, I would only have to wait 15 min in between services. \n\nOn the day of my appointment, I arrived to the spa 30 minutes early - as they suggest - to have ample time to change into a robe, rinse off, and relax before my first service. When I checked in, the girl told me my appointment was actually scheduled for 2:30 and I was handed a robe and instructed to change, however, the facialist came in before I had even had a change to put my purse in my locker and told me not to bother changing because we were already running late and I was cutting into my appointment time. She rushed me off to the treatment room, told me to just pull the sides of my dress down because she didn't have time for me to change and then proceeded to rush through the facial so that she was done by 3pm. My 30 min facial was more like 20 min. \n\nNow, instead of the 15 min wait in between services, I had to wait 45. I used this time to check my email and verify that the itinerary THEY sent me did in fact say 3pm. At this point, I was irritated but just wanted to focus on my upcoming pedicure. \n\nThe waiting area/restroom/locker area was more like a locker room at the gym than a high end spa area. There were many women coming in from the gym who were very loud and the whole vibe was not conducive to a relaxing spa environment. \n\nThe pedicure girl was on time and very sweet - however, the pedicure itself left something to be desired. There was nothing about this pedicure that made it worth $85. In fact, I've had much better pedicures for $25. While it was relaxing, it wasn't by any means through. I left with no less dead skin on my feet than I started with. \n\nOverall, I was very disappointed with my experience at the Sanctuary Spa. I left with a $210 tab and not much to show for it. Definitely will not be returning here."
0,"Before  heading out to one of the nightclubs we decided to wander around Caesar  Palace for a place to eat, there were so many restaurants to choose  from.  After walking around for about 20 minutes, we stopped at Central  by Michel Richard.  The hostess warmly greeted us and showed us to our  table. The decor is lovely, yet LOUD. You literally have to talk extremely  loud to hear one another. The prices are a bit steep, and the food was  decent. Nothing on the menu caught my eye at all, so I just kept it  basic with a Goat Cheese Caesar Salad with Chicken ($17). When it  arrived, the presentation was excellent. The romaine was fresh, and  crispy, the chicken lacked any flavor, and the dressing was way too heavy. But  as I looked over the bill they charged me $24 for the chicken caesar  salad (which I thought was ridiculous, gotta read the fine prints)."
4,"Every single time we fly to Vegas, we always make sure we make a stop at Lee's for our party rock liquor! lol!\n\nI swear this is the biggest liquor store i have ever stepped in & they even have tasters too!\n\nI always end up buying more bottles than I should (not necessarily a \""bad\"" thing if you are planning to party in Sin City..hehe) because I always want to try something new since they have so many bottles I haven't even seen (or tasted!) before. *^_^*\n\nAmong their selections they have giant bottles of Grey goose and the largest variety of mini bottles to purchase."
3,"Always quick and affordable! Like most guys, I don't like my eyebrows to look too thin, they do a good job at just cleaning up the areas that get out of control."
3,"The burger was the best I've ever had, had the Poblano. Everything from the pretzel bun to the meat and toppings was top notch. Unfortunately I waited 35 minutes for my food during a slow period, the service was abysmal. But, I will be back for the burgers. If not for the service, would have been five stars."
4,"Wow, I never have seen my eyebrows so cleanly/naturally shaped and my skin look so clear while feeling so soft. Threading is something I now think every woman needs and on a continual basis. Just try it once and I bet you will agree. Thanks Susan was for being so accommodating and making sure I was in and out in no time."
1,"I heard many good things about this place and so was excited to try it out.\n\nMy friends and I ordered the Thai Beef Salad, Asian Chicken Salad, Monsters Meatball and Spaghetti, and Grilled Salmon. We were extremely disappointed. I don't even know what the meatballs tasted like. The spaghetti and salad dressings were BAD. The rice was hard. The salmon was a-ok, but the portion was small compared to other dishes.\n\nOn the bright side, I tried their famous frozen hot chocolate, and I loved it! We all loved it! Totally made my experience better. \n\nI don't know if we didn't order the right food, but I'm definitely not coming back here for their food, ONLY FOR DESSERT!"
1,"I can really appreciate some good Mediterranean food. Mediocre Mediterranean? Not so much... As far as it is from my house, I doubt I'll make the drive all the way out here any time soon.\n\nKABOBS: Doesn't Mediterranean food revolve around grilled meats? The steak souvlaki was a little tough, quite flavorless, and dry. Given I did take my order to-go, but the 15 minute drive home exasperated an already existing issue. The gyro meat was pretty tasty! It was thinly sliced and quite flavorful unlike the beef chunks they threw on a stick.\n\nSIDES: The combo plates we ordered were supposed to come with greek salad, rice, and pita. The pita was stone cold and they were out of rice--they replaced it with extra salad. We also got an order of the garlic fries. Basically, french fries packed with feta and some garlic powder. I've eaten better at the greek festival. \n\nThe kabobs and the rest of the sides were somewhat lack-luster. But we really enjoyed the calamari. It was just as delicious as the stuff I get at Firefly. But the dipping sauce it came with was disgusting . It was some stale tasting butter concoction.\n\nAfter this meal of good and bad, I'm kind've over Mediterranean food at this point. After finishing the whole meal, I couldn't substantiate that the $25 I spent plus gas was worth it."
2,"ah Chino. I have been going here for years, well actually the other location, but same place. This location is really hard to find if you don't know where it is.... it seems like the location is not really great for their business... but I dunno. This place is good in that bad kind of way. The food is greasy, it comes out on paper plates or in tin take out dishes. It pretty much always makes me feel sick after eating there.... but I still eat there because it's just good sometimes. I always get an emerald chicken burrito and machaca quesadilla in a combo with the jerk fried rice. The emerald chicken is good.... all white meat and really oniony. It's one of the more asian-y dishes. The machaca is good too, just standard shredded beef with tomato, garlic, and onion.The BF gets bean and cheese burritos and seems to like them. I think the thing that always brings me back is the free snickerdoodles. They're sooo good....and also they are free which makes them even better. So against my better judgment, I will keep going to Chino Bandito.... \n\n\nOh, and if you're drunk... this place gets at least one more star."
0,"this gym is terrible.\n\ndon't let the new equipment fool you, there are only a handful of people who come here who have any clue what they are doing. The staff knows very little, and is way to present, as in milling around doing nothing. However they are in no way the biggest problem, the problem is the patrons, I've never ever had to deal with a ruder group of people in my life, and i lived in NYC for christ sake, I've seen this rudeness manifest into confrontation, injury, and all in all unsafe practices. I've been a member for 2 years and cannot wait until a better option opens! don't join here unless you enjoy being frustrated on a daily basis"
2,"I see Cafe Anfora is getting a bit of grief for their bathroom....!! It's a cafe, not a toilet - the toilet is a minor detail.\n\nANYWAY, the cafe itself isn't too bad! It serves cakes etc, when I asked if they had anything for lunch they said there was a wee problem in the kitchen, they were lovely about it so I wasn't too bothered. Ok my scone was a bit chewy, but it was edible. My coffee was nice and warm, just how I like it, but I noticed some people turning their back because it was too cold. Uhoh.\n\nIt's not bad, but it's not amazing either, and the toilets make it different!"
2,"Their burgers are pretty good when not dark pink inside, great topping and sauce selection. One negative thing - I am assuming that their water tastes pretty bad, bad enough to affect the taste of the Pepsi products they serve. I've tried Pepsi, Mug rootbeer and Sierra Mist. They all have a funny aftertaste.  I would give them 5 stars if I were confident that they were cooking their burgers properly and they fixed the bad tasting soda issue."
4,"Listen, if you know anything about donuts. This is the best in town. Not no commercially made crap. Made fresh everyday by the same person. If that's not dedication. I don't know what is. They sell out everyday then they close. That in my opinion means something also. Like I said best donuts in town hands down."
1,"This hotel was busy during the weekend I visited, and at times the front desk was short staffed. Noise in the rooms from nearby I-17 was a problem. There are so many hotels in this area, I'll stay somewhere else in the future."
4,"I didn't want to write my review right away.  I visited the salon after reading the great reviews, and after my pink and white acrylics, (done at another salon) were falling off and looking BAD.  I just had to find another place,  I want to preface my review by saying to the readers I'm VERY picky, and have worn pink and whites for 20 years continuously, with only one \""break\"" last year to try the gel nail phenomenon, only to have my pink and whites reapplied. They just work better for me.  Try finding a salon that does them well, and you might be in for a journey. I LOVED the new set I had here over a month ago!  The acrylic isn't so \""see through\"" so it hides any imperfections while still looking natural.  The gentleman at the front of the salon, did a beautiful job. The salon is easy to get to, decorated beautifully, and after 3 weeks, they were not lifting.  The fill was done perfectly, and they still look as gorgeous as when I got them.  Do not feel you need an expensive Scottsdale salon to get great nails - Five Star Nails will make you happy! I saw a few other customers' nails while there, and they do good work with Gel also."
2,"This place is a small, smoky bar complete with TVs, 2 pool tables and 2 dart boards. Service is ok and if you're sitting at the tables like we were you might not get any service if you come too early in the day. The beer was cold but the food was mediocre at best...They have happy hour daily from 3 to 6 pm, as well as a daily food special which is all dirt cheap...like 5 or 6 bucks for most entrees. This is a good place to watch sports or play pool/darts, but once you leave you smell like an ashtray even if no one around you was smoking!"
4,Mojitos.  Enough said.
4,"Phenomenal! Make a reservation and bring your best bottle of wine! From the grilled octopus and Israeli couscous / duck confit ravioli appetizers, to the grilled, marinated bison flank steak... This place has it all, ambience, five star service and an attention to classic French culinary detail that is rivaled by few. \n\nEvery part of our meal was perfect.. And with a five course pre fixe under $50.. How can you go wrong?  The staff was friendly and every single stage of the meal was perfectly executed. \n\nWe came here for our anniversary dinner and left with happy tummies and big smiles.\n\nThank you Le Pegase! :)"
2,"Holy SMOKE, this place had so much cigarrette smoke in the air it looked hazy.  It made the dining less enjoyable.  We went for the famous \""Steak Special\"". And I must say it was pretty darn good.  The green beans and mash potatoes that accompanied it was enjoyable as well."
0,"What a joke.  Asked for a glass of water along with a drink.  Bartender brought out a bottle of water.  I politely asked for just a glass of water.  She rudely said they only serve bottled water and they don't have a way of giving me water.   With the bar gun right in front of her, and a stack of glasses I again asked if she could put some water in a cup.   She rudely refused.   I handed the drink back to her and told her without the water, I can't drink anymore so she could have it back.   At that point we exchanged \""eat shit and die\"" looks and I told the group of friends I was with how pissed I was.  With a million bars in Vegas that value customers,  we all left.   \n\nThe atmosphere was boring anyway."
3,"Came here for the sunday champagne brunch.\n\ndecent variety of foods from chinese, salads, mexican, breakfast, seafood and even brazillian bbq style meats. I stuck to plenty of pork(bacon, sausage, polish sausage, italian sausage with peppers) and general tao's spicy beef along with other assorted yummies here and there. Only thing that sucks is you now have to pay extra for the all you can drink champagne extravaganza. \n\nAfter a night of drunken shenanigans, here we were getting drunk all over again for breakfast, good times. It's vegas, I think it's a written rule somewhere that this is supposed to happen...\n\nFrom here, off to circus circus blitzed..."
4,"Just like Thailand!  For anyone looking for the same experience this is the place!  Loved the fact that they had the loose yoga pants/top that you get to wear in the massage shops in Thailand and other Asian countries. \n\nHad the best girl tonight. Walked on my back, did the full stretching and my favorite part, the back adjustment. I walked out with a hot cup of jasmine tea relaxed and 2 inches taller. \n\nThe price is definitely worth the service that you get. These gals know what they're doing and do it well!"
1,"First, I should start this second review by saying that I made a review shortly after I moved in with 5 stars. I'm not one to be negative or point fingers - but my experience over the last few months has been less than 5 stars.\n\nFirst, over payment of rent. I take responsibility for paying \""double\"" rent for 4 months. Yeah , 4 months. My mother fell ill in June and passed away in July. I suppose I was wanted to be sure I paid,due to personal issues in my life. Turnberry never asked me to refund my payments, nor offered any compensation / interest on the $8,000 rent they had. This continued on and I finally asked them to refund my rent, which was like pulling teeth - it took weeks for them to do this, but I finally was able to get 2 months rent back. Loosing a parent and taking care of my 86 year old father was and still is the most difficult thing I've had to deal with. No compassion by the bean counters at Turnberry.\n\nI've been asking about renewing my lease / increase since November. I was told Dec 15 I would have info. That never happened and I eventually was told I would have a 10% increase on a month to month and a huge increase in a lease. This makes zero sense to me!\n\nSince Oct I have a new nieghbor. She decides to move furniture or \""bowl\"" between 10pm and 4am every evening. I am also privileged to hear arguments with her boyfriend for hours as she clicks across the apartment in her high heels, in addition to hearing her poor dog crying - my guess is she leaves the poor little dog outside in 40 degree weather because she's to busy moving furniture or arguing with her boyfriend. I lost it the other night and screamed off the balcony and asked her to please respect me downstairs and not move furniture at 10-11pm. I'm pretty patient since this has been a 3 month on going situation. Who moves furniture in the middle of the night, every night? It's wrong!!!!!\n\nToday I went to speak to management about my lease , increase and address the 10pm-5am furniture mover and aminal abuser. \n\nThey were \""sorry\"" but couldn't address  my issues because management is changing and the new person won't be back until next week. In addition, my rent is going up about $400 to be comparable to \""market\"" value. Market value us not $2500-$2700 a month for a 2 bedroom apt! Sadly if I do a month to month my rent increases 10%.\n\nI love everyone that works here; security, front desk, valet, service folks... \n\nBut Managment is a mess, the condo association is a mess and each one points fingers at one another."
2,"Dear Bobby,\n\nI just wanted to let you know that Mesa Grill is no longer my favorite restaurant in LV. On my most recent visit last week in which DH dropped over $100 on dinner for two, we left unimpressed and unsatisfied with our meal. The best things I ate that night were the corn bread (free), sweet potato tamale and roasted corn (sides). Everything else was kind of an upset.\n\nWe had high hopes for the blue corn pancake appetizer, but the lackluster barbequed duck was masked by the overpowering habanero-star anise sauce. For entrees I had the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which despite being huge and tender, was nothing memorable. DH had the Yucatan style grouper, which was light but bland. Where was the Southwestern bam?\n\nThere are hundreds of other nice restaurants on the strip at which we can throw our money. Next time we're taking our business to Mastro's Ocean Club. At least then we could have the novel experience of eating in a tree house.\n\nLT"
2,"In a strip mall right across the street from the Hard Rock Cafe, this place looks like it's made for locals.  Lots of TV's on the walls and airbrushed walls with stickers, signs, banners, ads for a Ro Sham Bo tournament, it's a lot to take in.  The bar looks good, but we were there for lunch.  The pork tamales were ok but had cheese in the sauce, which was unexpected.  The salad came in one of those big deep fried tortilla bowls, which kinda contradicts the reason to eat a salad, doesn't it?"
1,"Went tonight for a takeout order so we could watch Monday Night Football. Order and paid for extra celery & blue cheese( price went up to $1 each! )... Got the order and took it home. The wife wanted to know where the blue cheese was. There was four celery and ONE blue cheese! I was pissed and called them. I drove 3 miles back, and Chelsey who took the order and answered when I called back, told me I was wrong and she personally put three blue cheese in the bag. \n\nDo not ever tell a customer he is a liar. This is what she did. I am about ready to call the manager. My friends do not go here anymore but I've always defended this restaurant. Tonight makes me want to change my mind."
0,"This place kills me, it really does. I fell in love with a sad-looking kitten there, only to reach through the bars to pet it and find it sickeningly skinny. I *really* don't need another cat, but I was all set to rescue this little girl, because I was pretty sure she wouldn't last another week.\nSince there was no signage, I asked the nearest sales person how much the kitten was, and was shocked to find out it was $899.99. For a nearly dead \""pure bred\"" persian that had gunk in it's eyes and was the saddest thing I've ever seen.\n\nIt should be illegal to sell an animal that sick looking. My heart is so broken, knowing that kitten is suffering. I'm terrified to go back to see it. I can't afford it, and I'm beyond frustrated that I can't do anything about it.\n\nThe dogs all looked pretty sad, and their cages weren't clean. The only positive thing about this place, was the man in the bird section that obviously knew a lot about birds and we could tell he really cared. They need more people like him."
1,"\""Meh\"" is exactly right for this place. After reading all the 4-5 star reviews on opening night, I was really excited to finally have a sushi place downtown. Needless to say, I was very underwhelmed by the whole experience. \n\nMiso soup was sub-par at best. You'll get much better Miso at Hana (7th Ave & Missouri) or Yasu (near PV mall). Miso is my favorite part of the whole sushi experience, and they did just about everything wrong with it. \n\nPrices were what you would expect for good sushi, but definitely over-priced for the quality that was served here. \n\nGood sushi is about fresh fish, so my husband and I like to ask the chef's for their recommendation for the night. The chef here sent us out toro (it's the fatty part of the tuna, good toro is like biting through butter) which also happened to be the most expensive fish they had. I couldn't even chew through this toro, if this was the freshest fish they had then I am seriously concerned about the quality of their fish. It was like chewing a tough piece of steak and very unpleasant. \n\nThe chef came out to ask us if we liked the toro, and when we told him it wasn't good he got very offended and insulted us (basically said that it was because we couldn't tell good fish from bad fish). \n\nWait staff was also slow (we were the only people there) and didn't know anything about their menu or sushi. Chairs were uncomfortable (they were wire frames, kinda like shopping carts). Tables were too small (every plate and glass on our table was literally touching everything else b/c there was no room). \n\nI could go on and on with the things they did wrong...but I think you get the idea."
0,"F724 \n\nShe didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). \n\nSo, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: \n\n1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html \n\n2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. \n\n3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. \n\n4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. \n\n5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. \n\nOh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. \n\nOh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship). \n \nLe sigh... \n\nOpen T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm"
3,"It is worth going for the food.  Service was just so so; our server seemed confused when we asked questions about the food.  The water server was much more pleasant and happy than our table server.  I did not understand the ambiance of the place:  elegant food, modern decor, but the music was nonsensical noise; way too loud and I don't even know what kind of music it was.  Just didn't make sense to me at all.  I was served a glass of wine from a bad bottle and feel the server should have known it, or the bartender, as it was a Pinot Grigio and the color was orange!  My chair was also broken and it is a good thing I noticed it BEFORE I sat on it.  Other than that, it was great fun to eat and experience Chef Ramsay's food, finally!!!!  My husband had the steak, and it was cooked correctly, but the flavor was just average.  It needed a little pizzazz. Though, the lobster mac and cheese is unlike anything you've had before.  Just super creamy and cheesey!   I had the fish and chips, and it was delicious - the batter was very light and crispy.  The wine selection is limited, but you should find what you like on it.  The appetizer shrimp cocktail is amazing and fun to look at!  I've seen the steak presentation at other restaurants, so I knew what to expect, but I don't think our server was particularly helpful in that area......he seemed too distracted and rushed.  It is worth a try for a special occasion and if you have some cash to spend."
0,"I Specifically asked for NO MEAT of any kind.  Even made inquires about the sauces and if they had chicken broth, etc.  When I got home we found our rice had little bits of beef in it.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner.  Also the prices online were cheaper than what they charged in the store, not cool.  Certainly will not return to Quick Wok."
0,"I bought a $50 gift certificate to Bananas Ranas on restaurant.com yesterday for $4. I was very excited to take friends out and have a good night. The stipulations of the gift card were that you have to order $100 worth of food, and I figured that 5 adults and 2 kids could do that. Our bill was $116, but most of it was drinks, so we weren't allowed to use the gift certificate. No big deal, the gc made us pay an 18% gratuity, and I was pissed at the thought of being made to pay that for the service we received. (Silver lining, I found it!)\n\nWe got there around 6 and stood around for like 10 minutes waiting to be seated. We were handed menus and were almost ignored the entire 2 hours we were there (it should have only taken 1 1/2 hours.) I ordered a tea, which I sweetened with stevia from home. I asked for a spoon to stir my tea and never received one (even though I asked 2 times.) We had 4 orders of \""trimichangas\"" (3 mini chimichangas, 1 carne asada, 1 chicken, and 1 al pastor served with rice and beans), a bacon cheeseburger with fries, chicken tenders with fries, and a grilled cheese sandwich with rice. We also ordered an appetizer platter.\n\nThe plates the waitress brought out for the appetizers were DIRTY! They all had buffalo chicken residue on them. They took them back and they brought out coffee cup saucers instead.\n\nThe appetizer platter tasted like stuff I could get in the freezer section of nearly any grocery store, but it wasn't awful.\n\nMy kids' food (grilled cheese and chicken tenders) came out before ours did, they did fries with the grilled cheese, and when the error was pointed out, the person that brought the food out (NOT the waitress) took the entire plate back and came back with a grilled cheese and rice.)\n\nThe chimichangas were really greasy, the beef one was mostly fat, the rice and beans were cold on all 4 plates.\n\nThe red salsa was Pace, which in Arizona does not fly, at all.\n\nThe bacon cheeseburger was overdone, my friend called it a \""twice grilled\"" burger. I don't know if she didn't like the fries, she didn't eat them.\n\nWe had to call out to the waitress for drink refills, and my refill of iced tea came back with something floating in it.\n\nWe were the ONLY table there on a Friday night for half of the meal, there was no excuse for the slow service.\n\nWe ordered dessert in an attempt to up the bill (not knowing how far from the total we were) and we were told that half of the desserts listed weren't available (oh, excuse me \""desert\"" is what it said on the menu!) My kids each got an ice cream sundae because they were very well behaved, and I ordered a slice of chocolate cake to share with my husband. The waitress said she'd put a lot of chocolate syrup on my youngest's sundae (she wanted chocolate ice cream, but they didn't have any, so I told her if she stirred in the chocolate syrup it would be like chocolate ice cream and she was really excited about that idea) but when it came out there wasn't much on it. The chocolate cake didn't look anything like chocolate cake, because it wasn't. It was tiramisu. Not a bad thing, but not what you're wanting when you order chocolate cake! To make matters worse, it was still semi frozen!\n\nWe're not going back ever again and I'm not sure who to bestow the gift certificate on.  Who do I hate the most?  LOL  My husband made me take an oath to check the yelp reviews for all restaurants before I buy another restaurant.com gift certificate!"
1,"Totally Disappointing-\n\nI came in last Monday and was really excited about trying this place- i figured it was going to be great seeing as successful his other restaurants are- i was sadly mistaken. \n\nStarting from the beginning our server was very sweet but her food knowledge and wine knowledge were both extremely poor- she could not pronounce the specials - i cant imagine if we had questions about them that she would be able to answer them correctly- she struggled with knowing where the oysters came from- i wish i could've saved us all time and turned behind me as they were posted on the board with all of the other fish. As far as my cocktail it was a great margarita probably should've just stopped there!! My friend ordered another beer he had one at the bar first and she asked for his ID- Umm if he already has a beer why is it necessary to check it again- more of a nuisance if you ask me.\n\nOk so I love food and so do the people i dine with so we like to try a little bit of everything- we started with the Tuna Crudo- this was ok it was nice and fresh. Roasted Marrow on the Bone- it was ok barely any Marrow so it was hard to really get a good feel. Ham 2 ways- barely any Ham, served on 2 crostinis that was so much bread you couldn't even taste the Ham-not ok. Chicken and Waffle- good, again not very much of it but flavors were good. Ok so for all of the starters the one thing they all had in common was they were extremely small and you were barely able to taste the flavors correctly because it was poorly executed. Still Starving!! \n\nNow at this point I order a bottle of wine- we waited for a bit and then our sweet server came over to let us know the wine was coming, but not yet since the managers are the only ones able to get the wine and right now they are dealing with Valet- Umm ok so you rather deal with valet then bring wine to your tables- if this is the case let the servers get they're own wine to eliminate something like this. I was pretty annoyed at this point. But then she brings it over- she cant even properly open the bottle, she leaves the foil on the lip and then pours our wine by holding it at the neck of the bottle- silly yes, but again were they not refreshed on wine service or at least told what  they're standards as a restaurant are.  \n\nMoving on along next up salads- 2 Burrata mozzarella salads  and 1 Arugula salad- the Burrata itself was ok the salad was barely dressed and barely had any balsamic on it- i cant comment on the Arugula but it seemed like he enjoyed it. \n\nFor our Entrees i had the Duck- which i would say is the best dish of the night. the flavor was great and my duck was cooked nicely. My friends had the Rib eye- it was extremely bland and really just not good. My other friend had the Scallops now by looking at them they were cooked perfectly- but when you tasted them they had a very burnt taste to them like they didn't use butter or oil in the pan before they seared them- again poor execution. \n\nDesert was really where it fell apart for me- I had ordered the Bread pudding it was served with Chocolate Ice cream  - the Ice cream was nice the Bread Pudding was so oily that it was separating my Ice cream, like i get that its not a healthy desert and of course its made with butter but i have never had one that was this oily- extremely disappointing, but not as disappointing as my Tea- yes my hot tea was not served with enough hot water so it was so strong and not drinkable- i would have told my server this if she would've come back to the table sooner but that didn't happen. \n\n\nSo all in all i had a pretty bad dinner experience and i felt like the real kicker was when we all shelled out $100 each yes $ 400 for a dinner that i really didn't like and it was not in NYC so i cant justify it by saying- well that's just the prices- nope its Charlotte and I couldn't be more disappointed in Emeril's choice of staff in both the back and the front of the house."
1,"Decent coarse, greens were a little fast as they were a little under watered.  The place is definitely a little over priced and snooty for it's location........  You are a golf course in San Tan Valley, the attitude and prices would be expected up in Snottsdale, but not in the middle of the freaking desert...."
2,"The prices and care delivered at this Spay & Neuter clinic are acceptable. However, I didn't like how the vet tried to sell me on services I clearly didn't need. For example, she tried to convince me to have my dog's nails clipped when I had just clipped them 2 days ago myself. I far prefer the Spay & Neuter clinic in Tempe. Everything that's good about this clinic is good over there, but they're more professional. I gave the clinic in Tempe 5 stars."
4,"This place is awesome. Great tacos, super reasonable, and nice adult beverage selection. They have several craft beers, which is a nice touch for my main squeeze. The cod tacos are super yummy.. They have great happy hr deals too. Only crappy thing is that it's only offered Monday-Thursday. But, great little patio.. And every time I have been, the service was very laid back and friendly."
3,Fast and friendly service with good music. The malasada sunday was delicious! For drinks make sure you go for happy hour.
2,"Have had the philly twice now.  It is pretty good. Not the best in town but up there.  Nice atmosphere with lots of screens for sports.  Get the onion rings, they are very good."
0,"While visiting from the US we stopped in for a few drinks - and were ignored. The bar was virtually empty, maybe 8 guests but it was early. We walked in, I said hello to the male bartender, he made complete eye contact and turned his back on us so we sat at a table. I finally had to walk up and ask the female bartender if they had table service or if we ordered from the bar. \n\nNot a friendly lot, really - and pretentious for no reason. I'll gladly spend my cash elsewhere during my stay in Edinburgh and would discourage other tourists from bothering to stop in here...unless you like being ignored and treated like a bother"
1,"During my last visit to Vegas, I decided to try this place out. After hearing so many darn good things about this place, I truly hoped all those positive comments weren't based off the hype of Ocean's Eleven series. \n\nThe only food that made me go back for seconds was tenderloin. Besides that, everything else were just waste of money. To be honest, I tasted better at Wicked Spoon, Rio, and Mirage.\n\nMaybe they used to be great and somehow they are now on a downhill but from my personal experience, definitely not worth the money."
1,"went to Frys tonight to pickup some groceries and thought I would try their new semi-automated deli pickup service. filled out the necessary request and received a receipt saying that my deli would be ready after 7:21 pm. Great\nWent back to the deli at 7:31pm and my order was not there, Inquired to the person behind the counter on where my order was. He glanced towards the receipt machine and there was my order. Asked what happened and his excuse was that he was not here, ok you are now....ridiculous. If you're going to add an automated service make sure it works, maybe you should consider adding an audible alarm so people know that an order needs to be filled (since you have many people rotating in and out of the area)\nI just told him to forget it and went to checkout."
3,"Closest I've found to NJ/NY bagels in Charlotte area.. Bagels are pretty great, had a sausage egg and cheese and it was delicious.  A little neater (fluffy scrambled egg) and less greasy than a true Brooklyn bagel,but that's really not a complaint and I guess that's the Charlotte touch ."
2,"The food here was good! I had chorizo with scrambled eggs. It was good although I wished I had gotten the carne asada; that is one of my favorites.\n\nMy friend and I saw some characters at this place. I think they come out late at night.\n\n1) A couple walked in and the lady yelled \""ya'll busy\"" - if she looked, she would have noticed that we were the only [two] people in the restaurant besides them. #facepalm\n\n2) A few minutes before we were about to leave two guys walked in with a 12 pack of beer!? I think they left the beer inside while they went out to smoke a cigarette."
0,Brunch was garage save your time and  money and go to a real breakfast place.  2 hours for the wrong order of eggs and bacon.
4,Great Brats!
2,"I didn't know whether or not to give this place a 2 or 3 star review.  Considering mostly all the cooked dishes were cold and ,dare I say, not that good.  The only saving grace was the marinated meats.  They had 4 different types of marinated meats 2 of which were short ribs and the other 2 being chopped beef and pork.  All in all the experience was OK but at a price of $19.99 per person I felt it was kind of steep for the quality."
2,"I had eaten at this restaurant once before and enjoyed the stuffed chile and returned for the same item.  This time it was more bland and slimply hot and not cheesy.  I also tried the Pizza which was surprisingly good (4 cheese) but had too thick a crust to be exceptional.  An interesting but not really a \""New Mexican\"" restaurant, Gardunos, while generic in some ways, is actually the real thing."
1,"Service could not have been worse. Totally rude waitress, ridiculously long wait for food and our bill. \n\nThe food was not bad though, and the location inside the hotel and atmosphere were cool, so a few stars for that!"
0,"First I had to ask (felt like pulling teeth from the MALE bartender) if there were any specials.... I'm not sure if its because I was a \""Hooters Girl\"" in the buuuut there should NOT be a dude behind the bar........ He was not happy we were here. Didn't want to tell us anything. Told us there were no specials! There forever used to be happy hour from 3-6, this no longer exists not sure if it's just this location!????\n\nUpon getting up and walking out I over heard the hooter girl coming onto shift tell a new customer about there specials... We brought this to her attention but at this point are just upset. We left. Horrible service by Andreas......"
4,"I've been coming to this place for the last 5 years, the staff is always friendly and this place is really clean. The barbers are very professional and well trained. This isn't one of those gay salon's that will massage your head while giving you a reach around, this is a real mans salon. \n\nIf you just want to get a fucking haircut with no lame gimmicks, then this is the place for you!"
4,Took my boyfriend for his bday.  He looooooved it. :) SCORE!!!  it was his first time at CDS and he can't wait to see others.  Suggestion: know the storyline/theme beforehand. it helps. :)  worth the money so see it! :)
0,"Was here about 10 am on Mon/27 Oct:\n- No longer accepts Groupon vouchers\n- $3 for a 20 oz bottle of Coke\n- No paper towels in the men's restroom (so do the employees just wipe their hands dry on their shirts, which is what I did to dry my hands)\n\nDon't think I'll come back."
4,"Its not about the atmosphere really. Its the food!! They give you comp chips with guacamole, salsa, and bean dip. All so very good! Wed-Sun they have a $9.95 lunch special that includes a 2 item combo, fideo soup (also yum!!), and a frozen margarita! You cant beat that."
0,"I came to Spoonz with some classmates and without expectations. However, I was very disappointed. The atmosphere, service and prices were mediocre. I can live with mediocre, but I cannot live with disgusting over-priced food... which is exactly what Spoonz is.\n\nIf you want to spend your good money on terrible food then I highly recommend Spoonz, however I do not plan on returning."
4,"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing atmosphere, downtown Las Vegas is truly stepping up their game and quality.  Only downside was the time it took to be seated, but it was well worth the wait."
4,"This is the best Thai food I have had from their eggplant dish to their pad thai noodle dishes to the soups and the many other dishes I have tried there. I always keep coming back not only for the food but the great service. \n\nThe pricing is pretty standard, $8-9 for a dish but they are large portions so definitely worth it.\n\nThe only negative is the lack of choice for dessert. They only have coconut ice cream (which is really good) and coconut custard. \n\nThe place is usually not crowded so you're immediately seated with no wait time (I've been there for both lunch and dinner). \n\nThe bathrooms are okay, they need a bit of updating but are clean. \n\nI gave it a 5 star mainly for the food and service, things like the dessert menu and the bathrooms can be easily \""remodeled\""."
4,"Basically $1/oz of prime rib.  Totally worth it!  And it comes with soup/salad and a potato =d  The first night my bf and I went there, it was very empty and our server was VERY NICE.  This is what we got:\n\nSalmon: not bad but I didn't like the stuff it was on top\nprime rib: soooo good =d\nbroccoli with cheddar beer sauce:  my bf doesn't like cheese but he likes that, I LOVE cheese but I didn't like that =P\ngrilled artichoke:  very good!  But I think it's conditional, it was made extremely well the first night we had it.  The second night, when there were more people, the grilling and aioli lacked =T"
3,"I am a fan, as my rating suggests. \n\nI'll keep this one snappy - been here quite a bit, its awesome for brunch and their new menu has tons of tasty treats on it at prices that betray its flashy decor. \n\nThe bar caters, as most do in this area of town, to local wealthy businessmen, as is evidenced by their rather over the top cocktail menu. \n\nAlong with Monteiths and the West Room (all of which I've been to), this is a solid mini chain of restaurants with a refreshing approach to the dining experience, all have predictably tasty food and a well stocked bar. Any three star comments about 'staggered in here on a Friday and didn't like the barmen' perhaps give an unfair representation of what is after all an excellent establishment, ideal for romantic meal during the week, cocktails of a Fri/Sat night or a hangover brunch on a Sunday."
0,"Fuck. This. Place.\n\nI bought two Amazon Local gift certificates to use here. The first visit, we weren't brought any silverware or condiments. After five minutes of our food sitting getting cold, I had to walk up to the server station and fetch them myself. No one refilled our drinks the entire time. The signature crab stew was bitter and nasty. The steamed blue crabs are a ridiculous ripoff. What little meat they contain sticks to the shell and shreds apart making it maddeningly impossible to eat.\n\nAfter that lovely meal, we still had another gift certificate so we gave them another chance. This time we were looking to sample the crab cakes. After not being greeted by the hostess and having to initiate contact, we finally were seated. And there we sat, ignored, for 35 minutes before the jackass waiter approached our table. With no eye contact, the first words out of his mouth were, \""So you ready?\"" We stood up and walked out."
2,"This place is interesting.  They have a really large sushi roll menu, (with pictures) which is cool. But they also are home to some wierd sandwhiches such as cheese steaks and paninis.  Wierd, i know.  My friend and I tried the ahi salad, edamame, spicy tuna roll, and one other roll that the name has since faded from my memory.  The salad was great and the edamame came in a large portion, yay! Both rolls were really good as well.  Spicy tuna is hard to mess up but the other roll which was more complicated was tasty, it had a hint of orange. Lovely."
4,"I love this place. We are staying at Paris and have gotten crepes for breakfast every day. My favorite is the Bananas Foster. So incredibly delicious! Some other reviewers have mentioned flimsy utensils and paper plates, but who cares, really? The crepes are the best!"
2,"Tasty lunch- and conveniently located by my work! Have heard good things about this place, and likely will return to try their dinner offerings at a later date.\n\nPicked up two sandwiches on my way home and half-and-half'd it for dinner today and lunch tomorrow. I ordered the Parma (a spread of european olives and pepperocini topped with assorted italian meats & cheeses including imported provolone & mortadella from parma, italy, topped with shredded lettuce, olive oil & balsamic vinegar) and the Campania (Fresh\u200b mozzarella, fire roasted peppers, pesto, basil, sliced tomatoes, balsamic dressing), both Regular sized, for a total just under $15.\n\nThe Parma is more of my BF's kind of sammie: heavy on the meats, bold on flavor. I'm glad I ordered it warmed in the oven, the cheese was just the slightest bit melted and I felt that the contrast between meats became a little bit more distinct. Did not add the balsamic to this one until the last few bites, which changed the flavor slightly but wasn't necessary IMO.\nThe Campania is definitely my kind of sandwich: pesto and tomato and mozz balls, that's like the trifecta of Italian perfection, and I'm so glad I ordered it. I favored this sandwich as it was light and flavorful, and the pesto especially was just spot on. Also did not add the balsamic to this sandwich, but there was already some on the bread under the ingredients. Would order again, and would probably splurge on the large. Loved how plentiful the mozzarella balls were on my portion, not stingy at all!\n\nOnly criticism was that the type of bread used for the sandwiches (different for each) and the overabundance of ingredients made for large sandwiches that were difficult to eat- as in, I could not open my mouth wide enough. This is not necessarily a bad thing, because I really feel that the quantity and quality of ingredients justify the pricing and make a good value, but it also made me glad that I was eating my order at home instead of in a dining room- it was a little awkward.\n\nI'll be back for dinner, Chef Marc- gonna do a whole separate review on the uni linguini. Anyone wanna give me a shout when it's a featured special again?"
3,Chicken schwarma here is fantastic. Best in town. Don't add onions though. Pita chips and hummus are also great.
4,"We recently worked with Linda Corcoran with the Squirrel Hill branch of Coldwell Banker.  Linda was wonderful to work with - she was very responsive; understood the market; helped us price our house for quick sale; and found a buyer in a week and a half.  She was also very helpful and reassuring during the inspections by the buyer and she even was kind enough to come over and unlock the door for me when I was accidently locked out - and she got there in 10 minutes!  I think Linda is a great realtor and you will get a knowledgeable, reasonable, understanding, and pleasant human being to work with if you hire her."
0,this has to be the worst pizza we ever have had :( expensive and tastes frozen . we love naked city pizza and we have to drive 30 mins to get it :( we live aroung the corner from VITS PIZZA and sadly the owners are rude we walked in and nobody greeted us?? I as wondering if they were even open . and u can find them sitting outside on the bench together often? maybe that's why the inside looks so dirty.\ndon't waste your time or $ here
0,"This place is so close to my new home and I was so excited to try it out so my daughter and I stopped by for lunch a few weeks ago.   I must say it was very large, clean and had a very nice atmosphere.   The place was empty so we were seated right away.  The waitress came right away to take our order and seem knowledgable about the menu.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, we were asked if we wanted it fried or grilled?  I asked the waitress about it and she suggested the grilled calamari.  As an entree I ordered the baked ziti and my daughter ordered the penne quatro formaggio. \n\n Our appetizer arrived shorty, it was not what I expected, it was at best mediocre in taste and very spicy. My daughter was not able to eat any of it so I made the best of it.   Our entrees arrived soon after, the food looked pretty good.  I tried my pasta and the taste was 7 out of 10.  However, the garlic bread that was served with my meal was very greasy.   My daughter's pasta had a very nice flavor but it was covered with an inch of oil.  She tried to stir the pasta but more oil was accumulating, it was disgusting.  I called the waitress over and showed her the oily pasta and asked her to bring my daughter something else.   A cook? who was standing nearby looked over to see what was going on and she explained to him that \"" it happened again\"".  \""Again?\"" I asked, no one answer, she took the pasta and came back later with the menu and asked my daughter to choose something else.  She picked the tortellini.  \n\n10 minutes later, her pasta arrived, my food was cold and we finally got an explanation to what happened to the pasta, sort of!  It seems that during the cooking process the cheese \""broke\"" whatever that means.\n\nThe tortellini was extremely mediocre, we've had store bought ones that tasted much better and cost far less.  They did not even offer to reheat my meal after I waited for my daughter's and to top it all off, we were charged for the entire meal.\n\nNeedless to say that I am never ever coming back to this place.  Their management has a lot to learn about good customer service and obviously their kitchen staff needs to learn how to cook as well."
4,"Had to give these guys another thumbs-up !\n\n I stopped in today for breakfast to find a deal on Pumpkin Pancakes with walnuts and cranberry syrup. ! \n\nWow what a combination huh ? \n\nLet me tell ya , they were GREAT. My breakfast with coffee totaled less than $10.00 and I was full for the whole day.\n\n\n\nYou cannot be disappointed here , Breakfast , lunch or dinner. Fast friendly staff excellent service.\n\nGreat Job Guys , Keep up the good ..... Great Job."
3,This is probably the place you should eat in Vegas. the price are a fraction  of what you would pay to eat at other places. 3 appetizers 3 main courses and the bill comes out way less than eating 2 entrees inside one of the 17 fancy hotels.\n\nThe food is pretty decent. friendly service. attentive. tons of seats.
3,"Good food and big portions! I usually get their burger, which is very filling. It has a nice, casual atmosphere."
0,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I ordered from this place one night pretty late maybe about 1:30, after about a little over an hour I still didnt receive my pizza, so I called the store and they had the driver call me back, I stated my address as clear as possible, \""SOUTHERN AVE\"" and this genius delivered to \""7th avenue\"" really? why the hell would anyone order from somewhere that far away? Never got my pizza because they were closed by than, did I forget to mention that they had charged my card for it too? never ordering from this rat hole again."
4,"One of our favorite restaurants!\n\nWe love the Caprese Salad, the fresh tomatoes and mozzarella are wonderful to start the meal with.\n\nI love the Diavola (spicy and so tasty), Capricciosa (savory with the veggies) pizzas, and the Misto (shaved meats, cheeses, olives, marinated zucchini and focaccia), could only be improved would be to added a few grapes and some sliced tart apple.\n\nHusband's favorites are the Settebello and the Margherita w/ Calabrese and mushrooms pizzas.\n\nIt can be a bit busy and crowded but the staff tries to keep everything moving along as quick as they can.  Its not really a restaurant for kids but people seem to want to bring them here anyway. :-S"
3,"This old-school fish 'n' chip joint does the dish the old fashioned way...\n\nLocated in the Lincoln Plaza with Figaro's Pizza and BMO Bank of Montreal, stepping into Granny Bonn's is like stepping into the past.  If you like the way fish 'n' chips were served 20 years ago, you'll love this place!  Eating here reminds me of the fish 'n' chip places I used to go to when I was a kid.\n\nWednesday is a special day for Granny Bonn's: You get your 2 pcs. Haddock fish 'n' chips for only $7.99 plus taxes, it's a great deal!"
2,"This place is as the name suggest 'nothing but noodles'.  They offer several pasta dishes with different sauces and you have the choice to add meat to some dishes and others already have meat.  The combinations are nothing special and somewhat overpowering sauces.  The beauty of this place is that they sponsor many fundraisers for area schools, ETES being one and 25% of proceeds go to that particular school during that time which is great reason to support this place."
2,"It's the closest Korean place that I could find here in Glendale. \nLunch during the week is super cheap and well worth it. \nI think the pre-cooked meats (both kalbi and bulgogi) are dry and taste like they have been cooked earlier in the day. \nTofu soup is always good even though I like cracking my own egg in it. hah\nThe Pa jun was my favorite, because it had scallop, calamari, clams, and even shrimp! \n\nOverall, I'll give it 4 stars, but I'm being really generous here. \n(mainly because I'm korean)"
3,"There are three bars located within El Cortez.  Skip the other two.  \n\nThe Parlour was a helluva good time, and, frankly a sight for sore eyes as I'd been enduring absolutely awful drinks elsewhere all evening.  We were pleasantly surprised to see a full menu of classic cocktails, at reasonable prices, in a swanky, classy setting complete with a lounge singer at the piano.  I'm no Vegas expert, but this place matched up to the mental image I'd created prior to visiting.  \n\nService was excellent.  We had a large group, plus a larger birthday party near us, and the Pendleton Whiskey gals showed up!  Our one server kept those drinks coming, was super sweet, and was a great sport when we got her involved in some photo shenanigans as well.  The old-timey feel and comfy cozy seats sealed the deal for this lil swank-town bar.  \n\nWhy no five stars?  The actual drinks themselves, though a definite A for effort, and I'm not complaining, weren't very good.  Better than most drinks I had that night, but some major misses for a place trying to showcase classic cocktails (Manhattans, Juleps, martinis, etc.).  I know it's relatively new, maybe they're still working out some kinks."
0,"I love El Pollo Loco but this location SUCKS!! The guy in front of me was ordering catering and the girl was rude and said for him to hold on. She went to the back and came back up front taking crap about the girl she just went to the back to talk to. When we got up to the counter a new girl was taking our order. Her name was Cecy. She had her phone on the counter and was checking her Facebook as we were giving her our order. I caught her eye and gave her a \""seriously?\"" look but that didn't stop her from cruising along her social media quest. She called our name for food and informed us that what I ordered they didn't have. She asked me what else I want. I ordered what I didn't want. We finally got our order. The food was terrible. The tortillas were really stale. Nasty! I will never go back to this location again."
0,"Do not stay here!! My boyfriend and I had ended up here after our 15 hour drive from Delaware to Illinois. We were going apartment hunting in Champaign the next day and completely forgot to book a hotel room for the night. Of course the next day was move-in day for the Illini so everything was booked for the night. When we went to book a room, the night manager informed us that the cost was going to be $85 instead of the typical price since it was a \""busy week and the price should meet the demand\"" (thanks for basically saying your screwing us over just because you can?). When we opened the door to our hotel room I was greeted with the lovely smell of cat pee and mold. I think we were in our room for 2 minutes before I saw a cockroach on the desk in the room. I screamed, my boyfriend squished it with a napkin. After that I refused to sleep there so we went to ask the manager for our money back. The manager inspects our room and says he can't refund us because we already \""used\"" the room (I had pulled back the covers of the bed to check for more bugs) and that he needed to see the cockroach to prove we were telling the truth. My poor boyfriend had to dig through the trash to show the manager the dead bug. The guy then told us to re-make the bed and we would get our money back. Seriously? Oh and he also informed us that the roaches are usually downstairs and he had an upstairs room available if we wanted it. No. Thank. You."
4,The food was not only beautifully presented but delicious. The sommelier was very approachable and helped us narrow our wine selection perfectly. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.
4,had his croissant at Bellagio a few years ago and never forgot how good it tasted.  \ngot to relive that memory this weekend.  it was every bit as good as i remembered it.\n\nregular croissant + dub expresso\n\nBest Ever!
0,"Food was OK, but service hella sucked, all due to our waiter Jeffrey Hoth. If you ever go here, stay away from that fat, bald, lazy waste of air. I mean, 30 minutes to get a fucking Coke? Are you serious? And then another 30 minutes for our food. Then the guy had the nerve to hover around us as we ate so that he could get paid, as he was gonna go on break. Grr. Yuck. Bye."
1,"I've been wanting to try Tuck Shop for a while now and finally got the chance when my husband and I went there for dinner last weekend. Unfortunately, they did not live up to my expectations. I liked the vibe of the place but I wouldn't really say it was as homey as people make it out to be. For example, I liked the mismatched wooden chairs but they should have put some cushions on them to make it more comfortable. You know the cloth padded kind that you tie onto the wood spindles on the back of the chair? Just a suggestion. And it was pretty loud in there. They need some rugs or something to soften it up help with the noise level. The staff was friendly but it felt more like I was in a trendy bar rather than a restaurant famous for homestyle comfort food.\n\nOf course the most important thing is the food and on that score only one out of the three dishes was a winner. I ordered the pork tenderloin. This was suggested by our waitress as one of the best things on their menu and boy was she right. The pork was fully cooked but still juicy and tender. And there was a lot of it. Even better was the sauce... sweet and fruity but not too syrupy. The menu said it was a ponzu sauce but it didn't have that umami flavor (which is good since I don't think that would go with pork). And I really enjoyed the spinach that was saut\u00e9ed with green apples. You wouldn't think those two things would go together but all the flavors on the plate really married up beautifully. Hubby got the special which was a ribeye. Normally that is one of his favorite steaks but this one was pretty fatty and just didn't have a good flavor to the beef. He also didn't really care for the seasonings. And the only other thing on the plate was some saut\u00e9ed onions, in spite of the fact that it was almost $30. We decided to order some dessert and went with the chocolate chip cheesecake. This was a mistake. It was pretty unappealing when it arrived looking sort of gelatinous and wiggly. It was served warm (like warmer than room temperature) but yet it didn't seem to be an NY style cheesecake that had been baked. Actually what it tasted like was just butter and sugar whipped together and had started to melt. The crust was made from shortbread cookies rather than grahams and had a coconut taste to it that was very off-putting as well. Even the \""chocolate ganache\"" topping that the waitress had described to us was too thin and watery and tasted suspiciously like Hershey's syrup. I can honestly say that it was the worst cheesecake I have ever eaten and that is including frozen store bought.\n\nI might give them another chance at some point in the future but I just wasn't wowed by the food the way the other reviewers seem to be. Sorry Tuck Shop."
4,The Good Egg just opened at the Safeway anchored shopping center at Happy Valley Road & 39th Avenue (Stetson Village Shopping Center).  The service was fast and the food was great!
2,"Not so bad. The entrance looks like a hotel check-in. The security team here was cool, which is refreshing for a club on the strip. Usually security crew's think they are real cops with a Napoleon complex.\n\nIt was a week day when I went, so it wasn't too crowded. Lil Jon was playing and he's a decent DJ. \n\nSince I'm a local and I usually avoid the strip, I was (as usual) SHOCKED when I was told it was $52 for a beer, wine, and a shot for the the birthday boy. This is why I stay away from the strip. Not that it is their fault - that's how they pay their rent. I wish clubs like this would offer local prices even when it comes to drinks. Because seriously we could just stash alcohol in our car and run in and out of the club. It's not like we're staying in a hotel and have no way to get more booze. Just a thought!\n\nOverall, compared to Haze, Tryst, ... (and all the other clubs I've been to but can't remember at the moment), this one was pretty decent. Moon is still my favorite, but XS wasn't bad."
3,"Great place, massive portions. Could split one order to 3 every time! Great place to go after marathons :) Yum yum!"
3,"More like 3.75 stars...rounded up because it is an experience.\n\nWhen we ate at Restaurant Charlie in May, 2008 a few months after they opened...the host told us about the Kaiseki style menu they offered next to the restaurant. We were really excited. I took my husband here for his birthday in September, 2009. We ordered the 14 courses at $250 each.\n\nThe dinner took FOUR...yes....FOUR friggin HOURS sitting on a bar stool...comfy at first hour but our backs started to ache!! I wish they offered Aeron chairs and a back massage to go with dinner. Better yet Japanese Massage Chairs to use in between courses!! Put that in the suggestion box. The timing was totally unexpected...I almost dozed off!! Seriously!! I had to leave the restaurant and walk around to stretch my legs and wake up. I don't drink much, so the beer probably made me sleepy too. We got there at 6:30 PM; first ones in the restaurant...later came a couple who didn't stay...came another couple and a group of 5 or 6. Overall, the place was 1/3 full. They ALL finished before we did!! Our dinner didn't end until 10:30PM...we were the last ones there...they close at 11pm. To Chef Hiro's and Assistant Chef Matt's credit, they apologized and gave us some desserts in a tiny box ...but the wait between some of the dishes were 15 min-30min. Towards the end it just streched out; I wanted to leave...it was not fun anymore. I was tired and uncomfortable on the bar stool.\n\nThe fun factor is watching them prep the dishes. You get about 2 bites to finish each dish. The sauces are really good (you'll want to lick the plate) but they tend to take center stage over the seafood and meats. Quite honestly, I like all the small bits around the plate better than the protein itself most of the time. Though I didn't love everything (the sardine, salmon ice cream)...they get props for being fun and inventive. My favorite was the snapper; the watermelon rind (small bits); the cute micro cucumber; avocado ice cream and spicy chocolate. Also, I can't stand foam on my food; really no point in it (foam belongs in a  cappuccino). I do like the chefs...they are friendly. Also, interesting thing...I noticed the missing teeth between the two Chefs. I wondered whether they had a pact or something or if they got into a bar fight a couple weeks before (no bruises).  It's was strangely endearing. The two obviously respect each other.\n\nThis is non-traditional kaiseki...I did like the twist..but realize I much prefer traditional kaiseki...and at this price point (our total was a little over $600 for two); the timing should be perfect and every morsel should have me wanting more (well, at least the sauces and itty bitty bits around the plate did). There are better places you can dine in at this price point.\n\nTry it here if you don't mind a 4-hour 14 course dinner. It's an experience of watching the pros do their thing in an intimate setting. The chefs are approachable and casual. I'd suggest you bring a heating pad and some biofreeze for your back. Not fun eating in discomfort.  =("
4,"Holy amazing steak, Batman!! \n\nI was here with a group of 72 people, so we had a private-ish area off of the main dining room. Our servers were on point. If water glasses got to low, someone was there instantly to refill. If wine got to low, same thing. Everyone was super friendly and attentive. It was amazing. \n\nFor appetizers, we had Beef Tar-Tar, Oysters, and two types of salad, plus rolls. The Beef Tar-Tar was delicious, and the salads were fresh and crisp. Our main course was a selection of Wagyu Skirt Steak, Filet Mignon, Lobster Tail, and another cut of steak that I'm currently blanking on, with sides of mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms and spinach. It was all served family style so that everyone could try some of everything. I have never had such great pieces of steak...ever. The skirt steak was definitely the winner of the three cuts. The mashed potatoes were melt in your mouth amazing, and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. For dessert, it was a selection of ice creams, gelatos, apple crisp, and sweet potato cheesecake...all of which was out of this world delicious. \n\nFor anyone staying in Vegas and in need of a great steak, I highly recommend this place!!"
1,"Went here on 1/3/15 at 7:15 pm. The burgers were good, but the service was awful as usual. The hostess is always frazzled, and tries her best to discourage customers by telling them \""it will be over an hour wait, and then it will take over an hour to get your food. We have another location in Summerlin, you should go there instead.\"" She went through this song and dance with me and several other customers who had to interrupt her narrative and ask her to simply place our names on the waitlist. She was irritated by this and it showed.\n\nWe go to Bachi for the unique burger combinations, but the customer service needs an overhaul...perhaps a new hostess with customer service skills would help. I don't know if we'll return. Too many other burger places to try out that actually WANT customers in their restaurant. If you go here, try the oxtail fries, Burgers (shogun, miso, calbee), bachi fish."
3,Went here with some friends for the all you can eat dinner. Pretty cheap compare to other place and the food was good. We got seated as soon as there was a table available. We order our meats and our server was very attentive refilling our drinks and bring more meat as we ordered. Everything was great from the beginning. But beware of smelling like Korean food as you leave!
0,The food here is awful. Go elsewhere.
0,"We used to eat at the Good Egg on Union Hills regularly, however the service and food had been disappointing the past few visits.  It's unfortunate the manager is lazy and it has degraded the operations.  Food is slow to come out and undercooked.  They don't have enough waitstaff so our waitress was working multiple sections of tables.  Hopefully they will get a better manager soon."
3,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. I didn't plan to eat here but couldn't resist after cruising around The Bellagio taking in the Conservatory and taking a gander at the menu.\n\nThe food was outstanding - I enjoyed the Black Mussel Souffle and the Ahi Tuna Tartare - and the services was prompt, efficient, and what you would hope for in a classy place. It passed my \""I'd love to eat here again\"" test.\n\nPricey? Yeah a bit, but well worth it. Wish they had a restaurant near me in Carlsbad, CA."
2,"I've been passing by this place for a long time and have always noticed it out of the corner of my eye whilst on my way to Southpark. It's an interesting little location that kind of juts out of the strip of businesses. True to the bar n' grill scene, Char Bar 7 is a good location in a pinch. \n\nAmple bar seating in this place. There is a larger dining room, but we decided to have dinner in the lounge. The service was friendly. Nothing above and beyond. Most of the younger servers seemed a little inconvenienced to be there, but hey, it was a Saturday night. Started with the pretzels and they were just right. I like the addition of parmesan to the top and not just razor-sharp salt crystals. The cheese dip was nice and stood out from many others I've had as of late. Not the standard American cheese or beer cheese. This was made from, what tasted like, white cheddar or white American with nice pimiento and pepper chunks. Really dig the flavor these had. I'd order these again. \n\nI ordered the Leap Year. Burger, bacon, cheese, and a fried egg. Got the bleu cheese slaw on the side. Neither were amazing by any stretch but had a nice touch. If you order a burger without a bun, it is served on a piping hot castiron skillet. Seriously...watch out for that stuff. It was hotter than Hades. I almost scorched my mouth with the first bite. The burger tasted just fine and I ate about half of the slaw. My wife ordered the mushroom risotto on the side of her veg burger. It was nice, but just like other risottos. Creamy, heavy, and a nice filler. \n\nMajor downside is the lacking draught beer. This place would be a 4 in my book if they had some locals on draught being switched out on the regular. I ordered the John Daly cocktail and it was great. Sweet tea vodka, lemonade, and a few other mixers. Nice, but too fruity and a longshot from a beer to work with my burger. \n\nI will say that the patio is amazing. SO nice for the winter time. They have a cozy lounge with a fireplace and couches, completely enclosed and heated. Take that, cold air! I'd love to come back and just chill on the patio with some pretzels and another John Daly!\n\n3.5 for sure. Cheers!"
4,"I was very excited to get the opportunity to play Shadow this week.  It was everything I expected it to be.  Great layout, perfect fairways and greens, very friendly staff, and great forecaddies.  If you get the opportunity, you have to play it!"
4,Always love bringing folks here for the first time. Awesome selection of games. It seems they are going to outgrow this spot. Tonight had the most machines I've seen there.  I enjoy the older 50s and 60s games as well as the new. \nClean fun date night - any night. Highly recommend.
2,"The food is good, but I don't like the religious references in the name or in the decor. I am not a religious person and do not believe in god. I am not keen on being surrounded by Bible quotes when I'm eating lunch. The hipster decor belies the religious backstory, and perhaps that's intentional. I will probably not visit again for this reason. That is my personal choice based upon my beliefs, just as it is the owner's personal choice and right to establish a business based upon his or her religious beliefs. After the recent Hobby Lobby decision by the Supreme Court, I will not frequent any businesses that are owned by religious interests."
3,"I have to admit I was expecting more from SMoCA.  The only thing that the museum suffers from is it's size.  It's small and the jury is still out on whether or not that is a bad thing.  The exhibits I saw \""space is the place\"" and a collection of modern masterpieces from a local families collection was very very impressive.  \n\nFlow throughout the gallery space was quite nice though leaves you wanting much more.  The architecture by Bruder is minimal and to the point which is quite refreshing.  If you visit don't snooze on the great James Carpenter Glass installation and the James Turrell skyscape on your left as you enter the museum.  \n\nThe gift shop was nice and had some great art/design books.   I would've liked to pick up a \""space is the place\"" poster but they didn't have any.  Definitely recommended for the quirky exhibits and of course the Turrell and Carpenter installations.  Wait...maybe I did get what I expected out of SMoCA.   \n\n\nMy bad, SMoCA."
3,"Gotta give it a 4 since the pizza is pretty good, not the best, but the best you will find on East Sahara.  \n\nI have never dined in, and probably never will because the place always seems a little dead and the waitress/cashier/hostess/manger person is always having a spat with the cook.  I have picked up from here many times, there is always a different person running the show are that individual has never been very personable.\n\nThey do not deliver, so dine-in and carry-out are your only options.  Definitely call ahead and time your drive to arrive at the restaurant after your pizza is ready. Get your pizza and get out! That is my advice.\n\nThe pizza has been consistently good.  You won't be disappointed with the pie."
4,"After reading the reviews I called DC to see if they had anything Open for me to get my expedition windows tinted  today ( Just the front two windows) Joe mentioned that he was working on a car but he didn't have to finish it until tomorrow and if I come right away he will fit me in. Wow! Made it there in less than 10 minutes he pulled the vehicle out that he was working on And pulled mine in.  He called Me back in about an hour and a half after working on my car and it looks great. Customer service, dependability And quality of work Joe is your man.... Highly recommend."
2,"I was really excited when I saw this waxing place was opening up down the street from my house.  I have struggled to find a good esthetician in the valley.\n\nI went a while ago for a brazillian, had an ok experience.  I had Allison, and she was definitely a professional, very friendly, sociable.  The waxing job itself was just so-so but I blame it on the soft wax.\n\nI do go back regularly now just to get my mustache waxed off (ladies I know you understand me!), and I feel that this place is good for this when I can buy a package deal and spend like 5 bucks on each wax (cuz lip waxing is way overpriced at other salons!). \n\nI appreciate the clean, trendy space and friendly front desk staff.  I have bought some products there and I really like the PFB after-waxing serum they sell.  It works really well to calm down irritated skin."
0,"Horrible!  My husband and I went through the drive thru, and after screaming out our order several times, she finally repeated it back to us correctly.  After driving to the window, she handed us our drinks.  1 was the correct size, one wasn't.  We asked her to correct the situation and she actually rolled her eyes.  We FINALLY get our food and instead of the onion rings that I ordered, I got french fries.  I told her about that problem and that I would just keep the fries instead of waiting any longer and her response?  \""Oh\"".  Yep, that was it. I tried to call the restaurant to complain after we left, but got no answer.  We have been to this Carls Jr many times as it's convenient, but we won't be back."
0,"They call this pizza? I went in for a slice and it took 30 minutes to make it. The crust was very good, but they put cold toppings and cold cheese on top. I am from Chicago and we have some of the best pizza around... Maybe my expectations were too high for this place, I guess anywhere in Arizona for great pizza. Worst pizza!"
1,"Was not happy with this place at all. Took my nephews, who are locals, for lunch here, and was sorely disappointed. I order the shrimp with sizzling rice, and got a very mediocre and slightly slimy concoction, but it did sizzle. \nWe ordered a pu pu platter, and it gets very mixed reviews. the beef sticks were good, the fried wonton tastless, and the ribs looks so dehydrated, we didn't even try them. \nThe sevice was worse than the food. First, they do not include steamed rice with their entrees, so we ordered 2, which never came even after we reminded the waiter we ordered them, but of course were included on the bill. \nThey basically dumped our food on the table and then ignored us. We even had to literally get up and get our waiter for a bill when we were done after waiting 20 minutes to see if he would come around on his own. This place wasn't busy, only 2 other tables with diners at them. there was no reason for the bad sevice except the waiter was more interested in his cell phone then serving his customers. \nThere are lots of other places in Chinatown, give this one a pass."
0,"Giant Army Truck out front, really cool. Windows are shuttered and you can't tell if they are open or closed. Went around back to the main door. Also shuttered and no hours of operation sign. Guys want to shop after work, you need to stay open later and figure out a way to let people know that you are in the building. I ended up driving up to Sportsman's Warehouse and spent a boat load of $. I did go in Mad Man shortly after they opened. I spent 10 minutes trying to figurine out the pricing on gas masks and no one came around to see if they could help me.  Prices were nothing to write home about. Get it together before it is too late.\n\nTC"
0,worst restaurant.it is no way comparable with Malaya cuisine in elizabeth uptown charlotte.The malaysian fried rice which I ordered looked like old and smelled really bad.I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.If you want Malaysian food I will recommend the Malaya cusine in elizabeth near CPCC central campus.

0,3 out 4 delays in 6 month period that's unacceptable . We are gonna find a different airline
1,"They do have tons of groceries.  I went there and fought for a parking spot, fought the crowd in the isles to find my goods, picked through their lousy produce and questionable meat, waited in line to be checked out and then hauled my stuff back to my lousy parking spot all the time navigating the miles of isles with an active seven year old.  Not worth the stress or time it took to save a few dollars.  Shop a locally owned company like Sentry and the quality of the fresh goods will be much better and you will also spend much less time doing your shopping/"
2,"The Skinny: solid food with varying consistency (3) the level of service is all over the place (3) value: okay - not that great, not that bad either.\n\nI normally don't review a place that is a franchise. However, because my hubby and I frequent this one quite often, I felt like I had enough writing about this particular restaurant.\n\nWe've generally had pretty good consistency with regards to food here - barring one incident where we had raw corn fritters - twice. Service can be great depending on your server. Overall, not a bad place for a quick bite to eat but not my favourite either."
3,"Great food, great service, solid ambiance. We ordered the Valentines Day's wine menu special and it was just an overall fantastic experience. The attention from the wait staff was amazing for as busy as they were and for $125 per person including wine - 6 wines/6 mini-courses - what a great value! They even threw in a round of cocktails while we waited for our table."
3,"what a wonderful thing our first option was crowded and my friend remembered this place. I It is a bit over my budget, but this was my birthday treat.\n\nWe tried 2 of the classic things they have. I had the fresh mushroom with goat cheese and keel and my friend had the chicken crepe. I found more taste and flavor on the first one, but in general both were really good. We finished with one of their deserts. The raspberry chocolate cake mmmmm or something like that. SHARE IT!! to eat one alone is too sinful.\n\nThe place has a nice decoration and makes you feel very comfortable. Great to surprise a girl or a boy :)."
4,"Schwartz's is Montreal's world famous Hebrew deli. It is famed for it's smoked meat, which happens to be the BEST sandwich in the entire world.\n\nSmoked meat is found throughout Montreal but Schwartz's has that certain \""je ne sais quoi\"" special touch.\n\nHistory shows that it has stayed in the same, unchanged for EIGHTY years! There is always a lineup, no matter the time of day, or day of the week. The wait has not usually long in my experience.  I have been fortunate on several occasions of getting a seat even from the back of the line, simply because there was space available to accommodate my group of two. \n\nBe prepared to share a table with strangers. I can testify that in my many visits,  I have never had unpleasant table buddies.\n\nMontreal smoked meat is synonymous with Montreal.  You really cannot state that you have been to Montreal without trying Schwartz's smoked meat! \n\nBig chunks of salty meat, smoked over charcoals on rye bread = beyond delicious. This really is one of those places that has become a legend for a reason."
2,This place is pretty fun and there is lots of food at a decent price.  There's lots of neat stores including Hershey's! The music is pretty good. This place is good for a gambler on a budget (foodwise).
1,"So I'm not gonna lie, I was COMPLETELY disappointed with the Encore. My BF and I have stayed at the Wynn twice before and absolutely loved it. Since we had stayed in the past we both have our Red Cards and receive the promotions that come with it in the mail every so often. The last promotion we received was for the Encore and was for $109/night King Suites with $50 resort credit for staying two nights or more. With my BF and two friends birthdays coming up in the month of September the four of us decided to get two suites and celebrate. For months I bragged to our friends about how amazing the Wynn was and that I bet the Encore will be even better. We waited anxiously during the long month between our booking and the actual trip. We get there and are greeted by a beautiful lobby, over the top and so out there it's almost tacky, but it blends together as posh and classy. We are greeted immediately by someone who tells us to please stand in a specific line, though I can't remember what line that was (it was a special line). We waited for quite some time when another person came over and said she could help us right away at another computer. So we provide the lady our info, she pulls up the reservation, 2 suites with one couple in each suite, she offers us the upgrade to the 56th floor for an additional $20-$25 (which was odd because the last two trips to Wynn had upgrades on the house). So we take the upgrade, sign permission for the additional upgrade charge and go to our suites. The suites are beautiful. Love that the TV turns completely around so you can watch it in either the living space or the bed, comfy chase lounge, great detail throughout and, like the Wynn, a gorgeous bathroom. We had a room facing the strip south (beautiful) and our friends had a room facing the strip north and downtown. It started out wonderfully. So we put our orders in for in-room breakfast the next morning, down a couple drinks, and head for the buffet. We have been to the buffet numerous times, and it is our favorite on the strip. We made our friends fans as well. The trip goes to plan, loved the pool, loved the casino, in-room breakfast is always a treat. So here comes check out. We go down stairs and the line is insane. We're talking at least a 45 minute wait. So a gentleman comes by and asks if we would like to give him our room number and an email address and they will send our bill to us right away. I made it a point to ask him should there be discrepancies if we could call back for them to be resolved. He said of course, no problem. So 4 days later (which in Wynn language means \""right away\"") we receive our bill. For $448 more than our original reservation. So I call billing immediately. They only work 8-3 Monday through Friday, which the receptionist called bankers hours. I want to work at that bank! So the next day I call billing and the girl proceeds to tell me that I signed for the additional $100 a night (which came to $400 all together, plus $48 for their 12% tax) in addition to the room up-sell and that in doing that I had agreed to paying $209 a night instead of $109. I nearly lost it. Her and I went round and round and finally she says, \""Oh I see the problem, it's because additional people were staying in the room\"". There were two people in each room. I asked her \""Do you really believe I'm going to take a vacation by myself and leave my partner at home?! The average person vacations with their other half.\"" She keeps repeating to me that this was the reason and that I had agreed to it at check in. I finally asked to speak to a supervisor who immediately knew what the problem was. See, when I made the reservation I asked for 2 rooms for 4 people. The computer supposedly took this as 2 rooms with 4 people in each. She admitted they were wrong and promised me it would be taken care of and I should see the new correct bill in a couple days. Now 10 days later, with no new bill and no activity on my credit card I call back the billing department. I speak to some guy who says he sees the notes in my portfolio to correct the bill, but that no action has been taken on it. I nearly lost it again. I began asking him questions and you could tell through his phone demeanor he was getting irritated that I wouldn't just let him get off the phone and get back to the laughing I could hear in the background. He finally says he'll have to look through the bills to see what he can do and he will get back to me this evening or tomorrow. No call tonight, have a feeling I won't get one tomorrow. I love the Wynn, I really do, but I'm sad to say this may have been my last trip there. They lost an incredibly loyal fan. I hope no one else has to go through the mismanagement of this resort like we did."
0,"FOOD:  2-2.5 Stars\nSERVICE:  1 Star is Too Many\n\nHad 3 pies I needed for Thanksgiving.  Emailed and exchanged emails to pay for delivery of pies for $8.  No problem.  Even checked in a few days before to confirm delivery.  Response was no problem.\n\nSo day before thanksgiving, no pies arrived.  All day long.  I had wanted them before noon, per email, as I was leaving work early.   Called pick up location... supposedly many upset customers, no one had cell phone for Slade Grove.\n\nAt 5:30, the office shut down, two messages left, four emails, I had to leave and show up to a dinner party with no dessert.  \n\nNOT A SINGLE RESPONSE FROM OWNER ON ANY EMAIL, and they weren't even nasty at all.  I mean, anyone I know would have been nasty, but I don't believe in that.  Honestly, I was sure he must have been in an accident or some other emergency, and I would hear from him, no response.\n\nSo Christmas rolls around.  I write to him again, a week and a half early, ask for 3 pies.  Exchange emails with confirmations, no problems.  No mention from him again on earlier problem.\n\nThis time, I'm picking them up from pick-up place, a postal store.  When I got to pick up, only 2 of 3 pies are there.  No explanation.  Owner of store says \""I'm lucky to get any, as many people didn't get any pies they ordered.\""\n\nSo I take the pies home and eat them.  They were OKAY.  Not great, not even good.  Just okay.  I wouldn't pay $10 for one of them, let alone their $33 retail price tag.\n\nThey look like some brand new culinary student made them.  Maybe he brought it help for the Christmas order.  Whatever.  And they taste pretty decent, but not good.\n\nI can't tell you how disappointing the whole experience has been.\n\nSorry, all caps:  THIS GUY SHOULDN'T BE IN BUSINESS.  Some people just aren't made to run a business.  They don't have a lick of common sense, or business customer service, etc.  \n\nI'm sure the guy can bake.  I'm sure his food is delicious.  But he needs to work for someone else, who can operate a small business.\n\nIf you are thinking of relying on this guy to deliver food for an event, my advice is think again.  He burned me and many others... TWICE.\n\nI'm not even going to try and get my 3rd pie I pre-bought.\n\nNot worth the mental aggravation.\n\nSTAY AWAY.  You've been warned."
1,"Lower your Eggspectations, people.\n\nMy girlfriend and I scrambled over here early in the morning, after finding Eggspectation on Yelp, and getting yolked in by all the positive things that customers had to say about the place, so we hatched a plan to head over.\n\nAfter running through the labyrinthine mall, full of eggcitement, and heading up a difficult-to-find eggscalator, we came hard-boiled to poach some serious eats.\n\nThat's when everything cracked. The food was simply \u0153uful. What should have been over easy wound up being a truly deviled eggsperience for us, and fried our chances for a perfect foodie week in Montreal.\n\nSuffice to say, I left this restaurant with my sunny side down. Omelette you come to your own conclusions, but our meal was genuinely eggregious."
2,Superb bagel just wish they would cut back on the salt. Then I could patronize them more often.
0,"Went to brunch this past weekend and had a $25 coupon from restaurant.com which I purchased last December.  Warning:  They do not accept all coupons.  Even though on the \""new\"" certificates it clearly states that it excludes brunch the old certificates (that are valid for 1 year from date of purchase) do not have this exclusion.  When the waiter told us the news, the manager admitted that she knew this didn't have the exclusion but that the \""restaurant reserves the right not to accept the certificate\"".  She was downright rude!  We have a $75 certificate for dinner and will absolutely NOT be using it ... and I would ask before you dine if they will accept the certificate as it wasn't said in words but implied that they reserve the same right for dinner.  So just some words of warning.\n\nAs for the waiter, he was great - very friendly and perfect service.\nAs for the food, was good brunch for $29.95/pp.  Made-to-order omelettes, shrimp cocktail, prime rib, crab.  Pretty typical stuff, good quality but nothing that most buffets don't have.  Did include all-you-can-drink mimosa's, wine and bloody mary bar though.\n\nHate to give anywhere 1 star, but think its just bad business to not honor a certificate / coupon that you well know is in circulation.  Felt bad for the waiter who had to deliver this message, as its obviously someone in \""management's\"" poor decision."
4,"The perfect blend of high quality ingredients, incredible service, good company as a Tuesday evening left me mesmerized. Why don't I come here more often? I have been here multiple times and each time is consistently amazing. \n\nTonight we were offered \""Omakase\"" meaning \""Chef's choice\"" in Japanese for a VERY reasonable price, which was less than half of what I paid at my last Omakase experience a couple months ago at another Japanese joint. Ordering this way is almost like getting the freshest prix fix menu where the food comes out in courses. There were cold appetizers, hot ones, grilled treats, rolls, frozen dessert...the list goes on. One of our friends had a good allergy to garlic and the Chef did a great job of accomodating her.\n\nTry SOHO out during Happy Hour (4-6PM everyday) and you will be hooked, then come back for the Omakase for dinner or special occasion."
0,"Monday at 9:30 pm is when I walked in with my date.  They close at 10:00pm this night.  Two (2) of Carrabba's employees sees us waiting at the host stand, just stares at us for a monument and walks away as if they contemplated whether to greet us or not.  My date and I wait a little longer while few more employees walk around us without any acknowledgement.  So we decided to seat ourselves.  Another customer that was leaving aided us with the menu.   After sitting, the first employee that recognized us at the host stand ends up being our server/waitress, but that wasn't until much later.   \n\nThis is what I witnessed while i waited for service.  There was an employee moving tables around and vacuuming the floors around the table my date and I were sitting in.  This may be a little extreme, but why not really disgust guest by picking noses and farting next to dining guests?  The others were focused on the side work as well in preparation to close and leave.  Yet during cleaning up the restaurant floor, they small spec of crumbs were vacuumed but the food on the floor a few tables down from us was left alone.  I still don't understand their priorities.   The restaurant was fairly empty the this time with me being the 4th or 5th table to dine.  \n\nI give this place one (1) star only because I cannot go any lower.  I never expected to enter a dining establishment where the employees showed such disappointment because dining guests shows up 30 minutes before closing time.  The term \""going above and beyond\"" is not what this particular Carrabba's is taught, so I can only assume.  That assumption come from speaking with the manager for that night.  I was I got her name, but failed to do so because I just wanted to leave after her condescending responses.  She actually said \""well I can't be out here all the time\"" as an excuse when I explained to her the chain of events they led me to just leave.  Yes, just leave.  Not only was the server rude, she sounded annoyed that she had to explain the menu.   \n\nGoing back to the manager, I have a strong conviction that managers are to manage.  The manager for that shift is to blame for either the lack of proper training or the lack of care the employees show to their guests.  \n\nSo we leave and go to Apple Bees across the street.  The bartender there greeted us as we walked in.  The server sat us strategically so they could continue their side work without interfering with my dinging experience whereas Carrabba's just didn't care.   \n\nAll Carrabba's cannot be this bad.  I'm hoping this does not happen often, not because I care where this business goes but because it would bother me to know this happens regularly to other unsuspecting guests.   I'm sure if I decided to stay and dine at Carrabba's and leave a low or no gratuity, I can only assume they would have cursed me under their breath for being a bad tipper and not being accountable for horrible service."
3,"My husband, son, daughter and I went for a Sunday lunch. My little girl who is only 2 did not want to sit still and cried so we left so other people could actually enjoy their lunch. Husband went back to pick up our lunch so we could enjoy it at home. We were very pleased. We will be back."
2,"This is really a 2.5.  What lies between MEH and A-OK?   OK.  Like the first Matrix sequel.  Not bad.  Not good.  Just OK.\n\nTypically I stay at the Mirage when I Vegas and so I try to slip into the Cravings for breakfast.  I would not say anything is gourmet or jaw dropping, but you can put together almost any breakfast you can imagine reasonably enough.  \n\nUnfortunately, the most disappointing aspect of the breakfast is the lame 80's era hotel coffee.  Mirage -- you don't have to serve Starbucks.  Go to a local Panera or Einsteins Bagels to get an idea of what you should be serving.  Something smooth with some flavor.  Not bland weak nothingness.   You should be embarrassed at this point.\n\nI've read other reviews that indicate this buffet used to rule Las Vegas.  I'm not really convinced any buffet can rule much of anything.  I tried to over-rated Wynn buffet and the far superior Paris buffet and I'm simply not sold on the idea that any buffet can challenge a reasonably good restaurant.  But that's not why buffets are in Vegas.  They are there to offer cheap fast eats.  They are cafeterias with delusions of grandeur.\n\nThe Cravings is a decent 'cafeteria' if you will.  The sushi lacks fish, the shrimp is plump and bottomless, the coffee (again) sucks, and they'll toss you a tasty salad of your dreams.  Like I said, it's OK... for a buffet.\n\nThe Mirage has been good about updating itself and I think it's time my favorite affordable resort re-invent the buffet.  Scrap the silly name.  Pull the Studio 54 gold and mirrors out of the interior.  \n\nI'm hearing good things about what the Cosmopolitan is doing it.  Take what works and fix what doesn't over there, bring it to the Mirage.  Charge higher prices to people walkin' in off the street but give resort guests a bold discount -- and name said discount as a benefit of the resort fee."
2,"Better pizza than any chain.  Better pizza that you would get anyplace other than NYC or Jersey.  BUT, why go here when just up the street is Napoli?  Mineo's has the rep, Napoli has the better pie."
2,"This place is kinda hit or miss. One time I went and there on a Thursday night and there was a good selection of young girls that were friendly. Then on a Friday night there wasn't a single attractive in the place.\n\nThere is a $10 cover and the drinks are really expensive. This place is okay, but largely avoidable."
4,"During our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\n\nOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back."
3,"Hidden away it is!  I forgot where it was located (some friends drove me here and I was not paying attention as to how we arrived).\n\nThe interior is funky, dark, and small (cool copper counter tops) but that just adds to the character.  I ordered pork enchiladas(?) and shared the sauteed garlic dish (i think that's what it was)?  It was very yummy and left me wanting more.  The only downfall was that the garlic must have gotten into my pores b/c I felt like I smelled of garlic for days!  It was well worth it though and a spot you should certainly check out."
4,"I was recently in Charlotte for business and my cousin joined me so we could celebrate her very important 50th birthday. I wanted to find the perfect place for pampering and relaxing and Verve was it! From the beautifully decorated and welcoming property to the warm and inviting staff members, this was the right spot for the occasion. The owner, Verbena, was very accommodating. From the fabulous signature pedicure to the gel manicure, we were treated like queens. The other staff members were equally wonderful and all helped make the day special for cuz. I couldn't have asked for more, and I'm picky when it comes to my pampering.\n\nIf I haven't convinced you yet to check out Verve, you MUST go check out the pedicure massage chairs. They make you forget all of your troubles. Oh how I wish I could get one of those chairs for my home! I'd be a very happy and satisfied recluse. Thanks for a wonderful day, ladies. I will return."
3,Spacious & clean .\nNo refrigerator or safe on the room.\nDid not loose anything though .\nBring your swimwear with you . The pool is OK and fairly large . 4 people could do lapses with a bit of maneuvering .
0,"Wish I could give it negative stars.  I got such horrible food poisoning after eating here that I had to reschedule my flight which I was charged for, and book an extra night at the hotel because I couldn't leave the room.  Almost $700 later, plus the $100 cost of dinner makes me really regret going here.  My travel insurance won't even cover the airline change fees because I didn't see a doctor while I was there, even though I never would have made it to the hospital."
4,"This place was recommended by friends who just ate here the night before.  When we arrived, we were greeted and seated promptly and were given a basket full of warm bread and biscuits. They were delicious!  We started off with their green chili pork appetizer. This was my favorite dish of the evening.  It was kind of like a stew with tender chunks of pork simmered in this flavorful green chili stock topped with cheese.  It came in a cute miniature cast iron pot, piping hot with a side of warm, soft, and chewy tortillas.  Yummy!  Had I known how good it really was, I would've just ordered two of these and be happy for the night.  We then had the trout with capers, almonds and brown butter.  This was another winning dish. The capers were deep fried, so a lot of the briny taste disappeared leaving us with these little salty, crispy buds of goodness that perfectly complimented the the entire dish. The trout came with a huge slice of corn bread that was also very delicious.   My hubby ordered the short rib tacos which were full of flavor with plenty of cilantro and zesty sauce to bring it all together.  For dessert, we had the chocolate cake and bread pudding, both of which were good, but nothing extraordinary.  Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the area."
1,"Ok, I admit it, I love reality TV and trashy \""celebrity\"" shows.\nNot enough to pay for a Kardashian pen, $8 bottle of water or paper face mask of them.\nDidn't seem like anyone else did either.\nNo photos allowed.\nPoor quality merch (those beach towels looked faded and tacky)\nService was fine, but really just consisted of a guy standing around since noone was interested in buying anything.\nThose girls make enough money already, why degrade yourself with selling stuff no one needs (or wants)"
2,"Love the farm fresh concept, like the service, food varied from great down to alright and value was, eh... ok.\n\nFirst, I want to applaud the \""Farm to Table\"" concept - using local and organic is a nice selling point.  And the seafood did seem fresh, so they are doing something right!  Presentation is clearly a priority - both the food and the staff - they have been well trained and the ONLY staff in Phoenix to always follows the \""lower left, raise right\"" service protocol!\n\nSo I -wanted- to give this place 4 stars.  But while I liked it, I'm just not going to add it to my heavy rotation. It's the value part of the equation - When I got the bill, I just felt like it was a bit too much to pay for what I got.\n\nThe Good:\n* Chicken Sausage Flatbread: great app! Fresh veggies, thin, crisp bread and the hint-of-sweet pomegranate BBQ the perfect foil for the sausage.\n* Pork Tenderloin: This was the best of the four dishes we ordered - tender, medium rare, laid atop the cornbread (a delicious sauce-delivery-mechanism) - very savory, well-rounded flavor.\n\nThe OK:\n* Falafel Bites: good flavor, good presentation sitting on a slice of cucumber, but very tiny. For the four of us, the five small bites made us think \""amuse-bouche\"".\n* Prawn Pasta: three huge, gorgeous, tasty prawns amid an average pesto pasta.\n* Tazmanian King Salmon: tender, flaky and with a good miso flavor.\n* Chef's Special: It was fish, freshly flown from the Pacific, wrapped around crab, teetering atop the embellishments.  The dish was pleasant, tender, but lacked anything other than the presentation to make it remarkable.\n\nAll in all, I'd come here again if the prices were a bit lower - but while I'm watching my budget, there are other places in the valley that give as good food for less."
1,"We went for a casual lunch on our anniversary because of the great Yelp! reviews. We have mixed reviews, ourselves, though. The lunch crowd was small...not a good sign, but it is near South Mountain, which isn't a hub of excitement during the week day lunch rush. Inside, the place is old and worn, but clean. The tables aren't very inviting. There are fish tanks with large fish in them. The place is warmer than we like, so the overall effect was a bit dark and muggy.\n\nThe people who work there are wonderful--extremely helpful and nice. Honestly, that is the only reason we decided to stay--didn't want to turn around and walk out just because it looked kinda grungy inside (that is, because the food reviews were all so good.).\n\nThe bottom line is this: Everything on the menu is seafood,and it is Mexican. We did NOT love our food, but we did not get sick later, either.\n\nThere are no other meats. If we were at the ocean I think it would probably be fantastic, but inland, uh....no. The fish tacos tasted extremely FISHY and not in a good way. The crab meat enchiladas were authentic, dang it, but unfortunately the verde sauce was too tangy and there was pimento in the mix. It left a \""stale\"" flavor in our mouths.\n\nWe would love to know the day of the week the fresh fish comes in. If we knew, we'd go back on THAT day. Otherwise, skip it."
4,"Great place to sleep while on vacation, soft pillows and beds. The bathroom is modern and spacious with more than enough room for two people to be at the same time. The food options you have at the ARIA are great but can be pricey depending on where you eat."
3,"Take Chipotle and, cross it with wood-fired pizza minus the pizza, add your own personal twist then throw in some out of the ordinary choices (bison tacos, anyone?) and voila, Gadzooks.\n\nYou get to choose from soup, tacos or enchiladas and pick out your choice of meats and cheeses. After they stick it in the oven to get it all melty and toasty you add on veggies and our salas, perhaps grab and beer and your done.\n\nI came not too long after it opened and it took a while to get my order in. A lot of that had to do with that fact that none of us really knew what our choices were. The menus aren't that clear so I found  myself guessing up to the last minute before making a rush decision as to not hold up the line any more.\n\n It was a little haphazard behind the counter as well because the staff didn't quite seem to know what was going on or what they were supposed to do. It was like a poor assembly line that went horribly slow to suddenly speed up. It was like watching Lucy and Ethel make enchiladas.\n\nOnce i got my order though the meat was tender and delicious and I really enjoyed it. I would probably go just a little less melty next time. I think I need to go a few more times and become more acquainted with the menu I'm sure I'll like it even more. I'm sure too that by now that staff are more experienced and running like a well-oiled machine."
3,"I was surprised to find out that this was a super casual place to eat. One of those places where you order at the front, grab a number, find a spare table, and wait as the servers find you and bring your food. Bottomless coffee is self serve. \n\nThe blueberry pancakes are really fluffy and eggy. The batter itself isn't sweet and the stack of three is topped with powdered sugar and rolled oats. Yum. The oats really do it for me. Is this is Midwest thing or have all the gazillion breakfast places I've been to on the West Coast just happen to not to that? \n\nWe also got an egg white omelet with artichokes, topped with a smidge of asiago. The marigold potatoes on the side were good but like most other patrons, we barely finished. I also appreciated how lightly they added vinaigrette dressing to the side salad. \n\nI wish this place was cleaner. And the bussers faster. We had to flag down a busy busser/server to wipe our table. Atmosphere was your standard organic-feeling breakfast place but nothing stood out. I liked Cafe Soleil's setup better."
0,"This course has an ok layout and a couple holes with nice views, however it doesn't make up for a rude staff that pushed us every other hole to keep a faster pace. They talked down to us and were being rude. Not even one \""hello, are you having a good time?\""  No courtesy at all, just rudeness. On a Sunday early morning we maintained a 4 1/2 hr pace while having to search for our balls in monsoon casual water collection areas and high rough. We let a 3 some play through and were not pushed much from behind, yet the staff kept harrassing us and threatening to make us skip a hole. What?? I have never had this experience at another course even if there was slow play that day.  Here, it wasn't even crowded yet they kept annoying us. What an unenjoyable day and waste of gas money to drive all the way out there.  Never again.  The 1 star is just for 3 nice holes on the mountainside, otherwise i'd try giving negative stars."
3,"Went here quite awhile ago with my uncle... he stays at Harrah's properties regularly, and on this trip he was at the Flamingo.  I think they comped him dinner at the steakhouse.  It was actually well above average for a steakhouse, from memory.  Alas, I just heard today that it is not closed.  Not surprised as there's a million places to get a good steak in this town."
3,"Wonderful food, and excellent service.\n\nWe had a hour before the Michael Jackson One show, so things were a little rushed, wish had more time to enjoy the food.\n\nEverything was delicious.  One slight disappointment for my wife was the Wagayu hanger steak, a little tough to chew...  But then again, this is a seafood place, even she acknowledged she should have gone with her first choice of the sturgeon.\n\nOur waiter was great, got everything fired on time for us to make the show with plenty of time to spare.  He was attentive and helpful, and helped to get my wife the marrow bones to accompany her entree.\n\nAny downside at all, was that there was something between the waiters that night, you can see the stress and hear the mutterings and the unhappy faces when they are not actually serving anyone...  But it didn't affect our service at all, just something for the management to deal with..."
4,What a great experience - Food and service were wonderful - the steak tartare - YUM and the tasting menu is a real value in my opinion - you'd be hard pressed to eat this well at this price point anywhere. We can't wait to come back! And beef belly - what bliss for my belly!
3,"everything your family needs is on this property. space, cleanliness, modern kitchen, 2 pools, 1 kiddie pool, golf, fitness room, satellite TV, free parking, free wifi, grills on property to BBQ and rabbits for your kids to chase. \n\nthere is a strip mall not too far from property which will cater to all you needs. its about 35min drive from phoenix airport.  nothing real scenic to go to in scottsdale so enjoy the property as much as you can.\n\nprices are up there for rental and if you purchase things at their thrift store, expect it to be pricey too. employees and customer service was good!\n\nwe had a great time and cant wait to go back next year!"
4,"I am so very pleased with Aloha. I moved from out of state and was very anxious about getting quality care for my pets. I stopped in one day and was given a tour, which included the surgical suite and boarding facility. Being that they took me right back I knew that they had nothing to hide from customers. I was worried about transferring all the vaccine info and being sure that we didn't miss anything. Aloha's great front office staff took care of requesting all the records from my previous vet and I begain receiving reminders for vaccinations right away. I have seen all the vets here and have found them all to be professional and caring. I usually see Dr. Jamie and she is wonderful about calling back with lab results. She was off the next day after I had lab work done for my dog but had stopped into the practice on her way to running errands and took the time to get my results and call me. When I mentioned I thought she was off today she said well I was in the area and I knew you were anxious about getting the results.  In my opinion that says it all. All the gals at the front desk are wonderful. The facility is spotless and they have some little treats for everyone (people and pets) just to make you feel a little more comfortable."
3,"Pizzas are expensive, but they're worth it. I had the Cavoletti and it was a bit crispier than I like on the bottom, but the toppings is an unexpectedly tasty combination. Thanks to the staff who recommended it! You can see the kitchen staff making the pizza (including tossing the pizza dough!), as the kitchen is open concept, as is the large bell oven imported from Italy.\n\nI never thought you could build a premium-looking pizza box, but Famoso did it, with some very sharp looking dark boxes - stark contrast to the bright and colourful of cheaper pizza joints. Definitely an interesting way to differentiate."
0,"Let me start out by saying...boneless buffalo wings are my weakness and I am in love with them!  That said...let's get to the review.\nThis location doesn't really deserve even the one star they are getting.  First off, I ordered my wings and buffalo chips online and actually requested them for an hour later.  So I get there, right on time, and end up waiting about five minutes.  Okay, sure no problem, right!?  Well I get my order and head home.  Once I get home though I realize they had given me boned instead of boneless wings.  Since I'm not a fan of the regular wings, I hopped in my car and proceeded back to the establishment.  I get there and they apologize and hand me the corrected order.  Well I walk outside and get in my car and decided I should probably check to make sure it's right.  Well what do you know, they give me the wrong flavor and of course it's a gross flavor.  So I go back in told the cashier that it was wrong yet again.  She says, \""but you asked for boneless.\""  Once that came out of her mouth, I figured I wouldn't give them a third chance to screw up my order again so I asked for my money back.  She walks into the kitchen and after about 5 minutes of waiting, she comes back with the manager.  The manager doesn't apologize or anything, he just looks super annoyed that he has to take the time out to refund a customer.  Did I mention this was during lunch on a football packed Sunday?!  He proceeds to hand me a receipt to sign to show that I'm just paying for the buffalo chips....ummm yeah right!  I let him know that the wings and the buffalo chips were both in the bag and then he starts gripping at the cashier.  Finally, he figured out what the correct procedure was and informed me that the transaction was voided.  He then tries to hand me a $5 coupon for my troubles...needless to say, it ended up on the floor as I was leaving.  Never again will I walk into that BWW or any of their other locations.  That one experience has ruined any chance of me returning."
2,"It's cheap....not the best food, not the best quality. But it's fine to eat when you've been walking around shopping for 5 hours. I finally tried the meatballs and they were alright, but I wouldn't call them good."
0,"This used to be a long-time favorite of ours but we had a horrible experience this year. Went at 7PM on a Tuesday. There was no one in front of us in line, but the cashier kept talking on phone and would not look at us. When I motioned to other cashier on other side of desk, she turned her back to us. When we did get in (maybe 12-15 minutes later), the popular food dishes were almost empty, and the few workers behind the counters were not in a hurry to make more available despite requests. The server brought first round of drinks rapidly but no straws then disappeared for 30-40 minutes (he later said he got a party of 25 in the next seating area). Price has not gone down but the overall experience has seriously declined. Too bad because this used to be my #1 favorite place before the change in ownership and management."
4,"So this one tops King's Buffet for us! A tiny bit pricier because the $8.99 doesn't include drinks like King's does but TOTALLY worth it! And yes, their teriyaki chicken is better than King's too!!\n\nWe (my husband, daughter, and I) met up with Rand H. and Mike C. for lunch today and it was a great choice! So much variety and everything was fresh and steaming. Service was awesome and the right amount of helpful, not in your face but there when you needed it. \n\nMy only complaint was the fried rice, they only had shrimp fried rice out today and I'm allergic to shrimp so I had to pass. My husband loved everything he tried except the sweet and sour chicken, it tasted a tad bit bland to him but I thought it was fine. Not spectacular like everything else but still great. My daughter ate everything we offered her (not typical lately!) and was delighted with the beautiful fresh plump grapes they had available. I believe she also stole my husband's chinese donut and loved it too. \n\nBy the way, this 5-star rating may just be the first one I've handed out to date so congrats to you Hong Kong Gourmet! And thank you for the awesome food!!!"
2,"My family and I stumbled across this location as we were shopping in Townsquare when we first walked in the ambience is undeniably beautiful we were told by the awesome waitress that happy hour ended in 12 minutes. We agreed we were all going to down the first drinks so we can get the next ones before they doubled in price. Only to be told that when she asked the bar manager Jessica , she said \"" no\"". We were still well within the time period. When the waitress came back it was two minutes after happy hour. We ordered $160.00 in food, it was fabulous. The service was undeniably outstanding. However, we will not be back because of Jessica. When I find someplace I like I am always loyal and would have return time and time again with my friends and family. I hope the $18 savings was worth it."
2,"The food was just ok.\nThe beef teriyaki was bland. (You have to marinate the meat before cooking it. You can't just pour teriyaki sauce over the meat after cooking it & expect it to be flavorful.)\nDuring the first half of our meal, the server was attentive. But for some reason, we got a different server for the last half & he was NOT attentive at all. It felt like he ignored us. There was only one other couple in the restaurant, so it's not like he was busy. In fact, he was chatting it up with the other couple & giving them full attention, while completely ignoring us. We had to flag him down so we could get our check & leave."
0,"Although you should expect to be screwed a little at any dealership this one goes above and beyond! They set you up with a nice salesman which was fine until you actually sign the papers... Then the Bluetooth you were told your car has doesn't exist, the extra $500 they were to give back because they valued my trade in wrong never happened and the registeration that was suppose to take 3 business days is now at over 3 weeks and I still haven't gotten it. Also when you go in the finance guys a complete douche and dawn at the desk.. \""She's really nice\"" said no one ever! \n\nSure my mini is great but definitely not worth the hassle.  If I could do it over again I would have kept my old car."
4,Awesome food
3,This was my first experience and it was quite delightful the wine list was the most extensive I have ever seen. Even though I personally am not a wine connoisseur the rest of my group assured me of this fact. I mean they even will sell you a the wine list as a souvenir! \nAnyways on to the food the most important part! I had the lamb tenderloin which was great the sauce brought out juicy lamb goodness. I tried the sugar shank pork and that was quite good and a large portion. The sides were just ok so that is why this isn't rated higher.\nGreat spot for a night out in old town especially for the whom love wine. Get the lamb and don't look back.
3,"Excellent and tasty small food.  Extremely expensive, so be sure it is a special occasion or an important date!  Check in on Yelp to get a free sangria.\n\nThe dishes are tapas-style and generally shared among your companions.  Order approximately 2-3 per person.  Some of the \""tacos\"" were astounding and high quality.  Not much that I didn't like about it, service was above average.\n\nClientele is on the young side and kind of trendy, so it wouldn't hurt to dress up.  Great place to go after the opera or show."
1,I'm not sure about the other locations but the service at this place is unbelievable our server went from the cash to the phone to mopping the floors then serving our food with out even washing her hands once (EWWW) and this place would need a flood to clean out the mess and lingering dirt . we strolled in the location at 11:15pm (munchies)  and were rushed to make our order and hurry up and eat because  they wanted to close at 12pm.  I'll sum it up like this this is a take out joint because the dieing experience isn't catered in this Wok Cafe.  oh the Pad Thai is out of intergalacticly out of this world and is to die for !
0,"I felt let down by my fellow Yelpers tonight.  After reading smashing reviews, my hubbie and I tried out Pastis for ourselves.  \n\nWe ordered the hummus.  It was so bland, we started referring to it as \""chickpea paste.\""  If it wasn't for the block of salty cheese embedded in the middle, it would have been inedible.  Plus, on the website's menu, Saturday from 4-7 is happy hour and the hummus is supposed to be $4.  We were charged the regular price of $6 at 5:50 on a Saturday night.  (http://www.pastisaz.com/happyhour/)\n\nI had a Barcelona sandwich.  I'm a vegetarian, and there weren't a lot of options on the menu for me.  I'm also allergic to avocados, and without the avocado on this sandwich, it's nothing special.  I thought that they would have beefed it up a little to make up for the lack of avocado, but a skinny sandwich did it make.  And the bread was yucky.  The fries were good though.\n\nHubbie's dinner was the Pasta di Diavolo which he thought was just okay, and definitely not worth the sixteen bucks they charged for the bowl of pasta (and nothing else to go along with the bowl of pasta).  His comment?  \""It was a little better than Fazoli's.\""  \n\nThe service was decent.  It wasn't fantastic.  One thing that still bugs me is that I have no idea how to pronounce the name of the establishment. When we walked in, they didn't say \""Welcome to Pastis!\""  It's not like there were ten other people in the place either.  \n\nTo sum it up, we would definitely not recommend this place to any of our friends, and we will not be returning.  Wasted forty bucks."
3,"I'm not from Illinois but I came to take a look around the campus with a friend. Being fans of everything Korean, we decided to stop by at the Spoon House. I tried their spicy seafood platter and loved it. It was well worth the price.\n\nI also got the Korean quesadilla/taco. Those tasted not so great and oddly sweet."
0,"Beware of Sam the order taker! She will laugh at you for ordering too much food! \n\nToday, we are moving lots of furniture. There is a big group of us, we are hungry & Mcdonalds seems easy,  fast and efficient.. Right?? No no no!\n\nIt's was my job to grab lunch for the group. I came up  to the drive thru, and Ordered 6 mcdoubles.. The order taker Sam's reply is \""wow 6 mcdoubles, that's a lot of mcdoubles\"" ( laughing ) \nMe : \""yes 6\""\nSam: \""you must be so hungry for 6 mcdoubles, wow!! ) still laughing) \nMe: \""well yah I'm 400 pounds, of course I want all this food\""\nThen I ordered more to the order, because that's what my group requested.\n\nMy friend & I were in shock! We could not believe a fast food order taker could be so condescending and rude!! \n\nI requested to talk to a manager and I had told her what happened. She was very apologetic, which I understand it's not her fault her staff are rude kids. I told her she needed to get my order and I was not going to go up to the next window because I would go off on Sam. \n\nAs I was waiting, the window staff member asked me to move to the next window. I told him no, I was waiting for the manager and I would not move till I got my order. He rolled his eyes. He was a stocky rude boy. \nThe manager  came back out with our \""HUGE\"" order and apologized again and gave me a punch card for a free value meal.\nI told her it wasn't her fault but she does need to get a grip on her rude staff.\n\nMcDonald's , this is not how we know you. I'm still utterly disgusted with the service I received today. I will NEVER be back at this location again and I will be writing corporate. \n\nAdvice : Go to Indian school & Hayden location, they are friendly fast and not rude.  They don't care how much or how little you order!"
1,"I'm guessing the number of great reviews on this place is due to the fact that most people on The Strip in Vegas are drunk and have the munchies.  While the menu looks great, the food is underwhelming.  We had the Chili Fries for an appetizer - it was OK, but nothing special.  Then we had the Mayor of Flavortown.  The sandwich was kind of dry.  The seasoning on the fries was strange - almost sweet - not what I want in a French fry.  The staff was great and I liked the atmosphere, but we won't give it another try."
2,"Popped in here for a dinner with friends and having only been here for lunch I had yet to try the BBQ.  I ended up splitting the big boy plate (I forget the actual name) with my girlfriend.  All the BBQ on the plate was delicious although I thought the chicken BBQ was a bit too dry.  That's a hard one to keep from drying out though.  The pulled pork was good and moist.\n\nThe interior is a little dated but I'm doubtful any of the patrons of this place really care.  It's got a pretty cool neighborhood feel.  The service was great and friendly.\n\nBottom line is, there are so many great choices for BBQ in Charlotte, this place is easy to overlook.  It just didn't stand out to me."
0,"San Gennaro Feast has become an expensive no-reason-to-go money pit. It started out great and has devolved in quality with each passing year.\n\nHave sampled everything this festival has to offer and the only thing that is a constant is the lemonade stand. The sausage tend to be pre-cooked in large batches and end up drying out because no one is willing to pay $10+ for a shriveled sausage sandwich.\n\nThe entry fee is ridiculous, especially after moving to a non-casino facility away from the Strip. Total Gypsie fest."
1,"Huge rooms. Soft towels. Comfortable bed with tons of pillows.  \nThree things that make me happy when I'm traveling.  \n\nWhat's wrong with this place, then? First of all, the location is central to nothing aside from the mall which houses several chain restaurants.  Second, the staff could not care less about pretty much anything. While the woman who checked us in was helpful and friendly, that was the end of that. Despite requesting my Hilton status \""amenities\"" (just a package of snacks and water...not much), I never received it.  I was also charged $30 for internet when I shouldn't have paid a thing (got the bill corrected at check out). And housekeeping didn't leave enough towels or replace the water.  \n\nConsidering we paid over $200 a night, the blase attitude of the staff is very disappointing."
2,Quick and tasty Chicken Sandwches. Nothing special
3,"I was SO SO SO excited that Istanbul Grill found a new home! It was heartbreaking when they were kicked out of their old space. But this felt like an adventure. If you don't work at the Steel Building, or you aren't familiar with the underbelly of the building like me, you might be completely lost. Especially if the security guard hasn't even heard of the business!\n\nWhen finally found, it was pure joy! Although it doesn't look like they have quite the room or set-up they used to, I will admit it looks a little cleaner (which is a good thing). I was pumped to get my normal chicken salad with beets, white sauce and two grape leaves, all for $10 bucks! And the massive amount they give you, my lord, you could eat for two days!\n\nNow, while it was still delicious, one thing I noticed was that my chicken had to be bottom of the barrel chicken. A lot of it was overcooked and too hard to even eat. Bummer. Why would I go back? Because I know it's still awesome and I'm crossing my fingers this was an \""off\"" day. That's how much I love this place! Five star experience hopefully next time..."
1,"Simply just not impressed. I've had better Chinese food buffets for less. The only reason I went out of my way to the city of Henderson was because of a groupon I received.  I will say, however,  that the place was very clean and the service was good."
3,"My boyfriend took me to Hillstone on Saturday night for dinner to celebrate our 3 year anniversary. \n\n1-The interior is stunning. A gorgeous patio with big open windows, a wrap around bar that is decorated with expensive wines, whiskeys, etc... and fresh fruit, the lighting is dim (for us romantic folks), and the overall architecture is modern.\n\n2-Hillstone has exceptional service. From the second we walked in the door we experienced nothing but real people trying to help us enjoy a relaxing evening with dangerously delicious food and beverage. If you are a wine snob, this place is for you. I LOVE myself a killer glass of wine but seeing as how my boyfriend already spoiled us with two new bottles, (which we've yet to enjoy together) we decided to go with cocktails. Our bartender was fabulous and friendly BUT he didn't know what a Moscow Mule was when I ordered it and my boyfriends Manhattan tasted more like watered down whiskey with muddled orange. With no hopes for a Moscow Mule I decided to order their Margarita on the rocks since I could see at least 4 other people at the bar with one. Can't go wrong right? It was ok. A little too much sweet and sour for my pallet. I was a little annoyed when I asked for a drink suggestion from the bartender he automatically started with \""We have Cosmopolitans, Lemon drops....\"" as soon as he said \""Lemon Drop\"" I felt my face go blank and in my head I said \""really man? I know I'm a girl but really?\"" I almost stopped him dead in his tracks to order a glass of whiskey. Straight up. He was just being a great and informative bartender so I of course understood. Just thought that was fairly entertaining. I'm sure they have both those drinks ordered a lot! \n\n3- The food is stupid amounts of tasty and the portions are more than anyone would really ever need. Which is good right? Leftovers! We ordered the Cheese Bread, Grilled Artichoke, and The Vegetarian Burger to share. So basically we ordered pizza, one vegetable, and a hamburger and fries. I felt so heavy after ha! But boy or boy, my taste buds were singing and dancing their little hearts out. \n\nYou get 3 large pieces of half an artichoke, which was more than enough for us. We ended up taking one of the artichoke pieces home. you get 6 fairly large sized pieces of soft, warm ciabata bread covered in two cheeses with olive oil and herbs... and the Vegetarian Burger is on a classic hamburger bun with tomatos, shredded lettuce, pickles, and the burger itself has some sort of orange chutney or glaze(?) on it. SO GOOD. This veggie burger is pretty well known and popular from what I hear! Even steak lovers have got to try it.\n\nThis place has a higher price point and for good reason. Great atmosphere, amazing service, and food that makes your heart happy. You'll be happy to pay for the experience."
1,"The food at Fran's is pretty good. I mean they have bacon wrapped tater tots which is ingenious. Personally, i recommend the jalapeno bacon sweet potato tots over the other variety that is offered. The burgers, which were being served on pretzel rolls before everyone else started doing it,  are also good. However, nothing special enough to write home about. While the food is decent the thing that gets me about Fran's is the prices. I paid almost $30 for 2 burgers w/ no sides and the tot appetizer which included only about 14 pieces. In my opinion that is just a bit much for the amount of food i got and to still be hungry after its gone. I haven't written Fran's off but i doubt i will return when i can get a burger with fries for  less than $15 at many other restaurants around town."
2,"We ate here in July and although I am a fan of the food-I think this place runs a bit of a scam...\n\nFrom what I can tell, they basically sell wine, although they claim to have someone run down the street or what have you.  So you pay them and tip them but no real running down the street ever happens.  I bet they have boxes of it back there.  That said, it's still probably cheaper than buying it.\n\nThe service here I would describe as mixed.  We went on a night when it was DEAD.  It was just us and a few other people finishing up.  It was a Weds and it must have been about 9pm when we were seated.\n\nI can't recall our servers name after all that time, but he was a bit of a know it all.  If you get this guy you will know it...he will basically \""suggest\"" this and that...but these aren't suggestions, he will probably poison you if you don't follow them.  I am only half joking.  He \""suggested\"" only the most expensive stuff on the menu-but for me it was all good.  It was a great meal with a good friend I rarely see, but it was a little intimidating.  I actually think this guy deserves a good beating...god knows how many people he has done this to.  The pastas, the apps and the entrees were all, for me, solid to excellent.  If it was just on the food I would give them 5 stars, but the guy was a total ass...and I wouldn't eat here again.  I would rather eat at an ok restaurant (food wise) with great service than the opposite.  Our check was pretty steap, which is ok and we tipped Mr. recommendation well, but I can't endorse the place because of this.  Don't get me wrong-it was good enough to overlook the service as long as you can ensure you don't get this guy.  I don't know how to do that though, and I don't like being strong armed by anyone...least of all by some guy who brings me my food and is supposed to let ME decide.  Capiche?"
0,"Found bleach spots on 2 shirts. Went in 4 times to get it resolved because the manager wasn't there the 1st 3 times. Then she said \""we don't use bleach and we didn't do this\"". Well I sure didn't ruin my shirts for fun, nor do I like to frequently stop by a place repeatedly for giggles. The manager/owner turned her back and walked away. Me= a couple hundred dollars down the drain. Nothing I can do and nothing they are willing to do or admit. DO NOT GO HERE!!!"
0,"After just about an hour of waiting for our 3 orders of various nachos we walked out...I think the wait was absolutly ridiculous and the waitress and manager agreed with me as well. \nWe were excited about trying our nachos as there were numerous options to put on the \""build your own nachos\"" page...All chips said they were made on site and my daughter who is so picky loved the idea of spam being on her nachos..Yes, my fellow islanders-SPAM is an option as well as kim chee-exciting huh? If we only we had 4hrs to kill then maybe we could have tried it!!! We waited and waited and waited and finally nothing!!!! The waitress kept telling us that it will be just a few minutes but after a while we knew tasting our nacho masterpieces was not meant to be...\nWhile waiting we were given house muffins(jalapenos inside) with honey butter- the muffins were so cold and sadly we did not enjoy these. As we stood up to leave the waitress let us know that there are 3 cooks in the kitchen and 3 managers all assisting the cooks trying to get food out-seems like mass confusion to me as it was not a packed restaurant at all!!! I know this is a new place (the waitress said they have been open for a month) but why open a restaurant if your cooks aren't able to handle 3 orders of nachos- nachos a dish that is in your name and supposedly your speacialty....Kinks should have been worked out within the first few weeks because the last thing you want especially now is for your customers to walk out because of the wait and not be able to even try the food.\nThe waitress was nice and seemed embarrased by the wait herself and it was also said that a table before us also walked out because of the wait. She got the manager who was also apologetic and said that there was no excuse for the wait. So to compensate for our time there he gave us a $15.00 gift certificate to come back.Hmmm I'll have to sleep on that..."
2,I attended Mass while in Vegas on business.  The deacon asks visitors to stand before Mass and introduces / welcomes you to the church community.  I thought this was very thoughtful.  There are no kneelers so you stand when you would normally kneel.  The altar is in the middle of the room with everyone facing in which was nice.  There was no crucifix so I know that would have bothered my wife had she been with me but all in all I really enjoyed Mass.  Felt very inviting and comfortable.
3,"Loving this neighborhood froyo joint.  The topping selections are interesting and slightly different thatn some other places.  They have these yummy little chocolate rocks...kinda like candy coated chocolate shaped like rocks.  They were fun and tasty.  A nice assortment of topping sauces too...peanut butter, mallow, strawberry.  This place gets jam packed but they do have a good amount of seating both inside and out."
1,The service of our waitress was very rude and not professional.  Sat for 20min never came back to take our order. Food didn't taste good. It was too salty.
2,"You can't use Galaxy Gift Cards to buy tickets online. Seems to be a severe disconnect here. When I called to question this, the girl that answered was not very sympathetic. Her reply was that I could come down and buy the tickets in person. This seems ridiculous since all the movies I ever want to see sell out hours before showtime. This is not convenient. I would never buy someone a gift card, or ask to receive one as a gift. Its a waste. I've had someone contact me with a work around, however I don't think I have much left on my card. Regardless my gift card experience left a lot to be desired and I wouldn't want to put anyone else through that.  \n\nHowever the actual movie theatre itself is amazing but don't believe that bit about no bad seat. Make sure you sit in the 3rd row or further for optimal viewing. \n\nI love the seats that fully recline. Bar offers wine. What more could you ask for?"
1,"I tried this place because of the high reviews. It's a shame when you go somewhere with high expectations and you're let down. \n\nWe tried their one item carryout pizza special for $5.45, let me tell you, you get what you pay for. The pepperoni and cheese were so skimpy and non-existant. I ended up scraping the toppings onto TWO slices, the rest of the pizza/ scraped off dough were thrown out.\n\nFortunately, or so I thought I still had a BLT, the bacon consisted of little bits here and there. What happened to the fresh bacon? The long slices of bacon? Or plenty of bacon? They weren't in my sandwich, that's for sure.\n\nChecho fries, yeah we got an order. $2.99 for a little to go box doesn't seem worth it. When I was there I saw a basket being delivered to the table next to me, I thought that was more like it, so unless you're eating at the restaurant pass on the Checho fries.\n\nI probably won't go back."
2,I wouldn't advise any health nut go here but if you want some cheap super yummy HUGE taco's with frybread wrappers?   Hit it up!\n\nThe ladies working were really nice and the price was pretty fair.\n\nI felt like a peace pipe afterwards... no really... okay no I didn't but it was really good.
1,"Food was no better than adequate.  Service was worse.  Waiter did not speak English well, so our order was messed up.  One hour time limit.  Everything tasted of ginger, and more than just a hint of it. Atmosphere wasn't very good.  Poor lighting makes it difficult to read menu.  We will not be going back, even though it is very close to home."
2,"It's Olive Garden with a personality. Buca di Beppo, though a chain, has more than a few things going for it. \n\nThe Scottsdale location can easily accommodate large groups. Family style servings contribute to great interaction with friends and family. The d\u00e9cor is gaudy and creative, with an emphasis on Italian heritage and a touch of humor here and there. Gene Simmons on the celebrity wall? Generally friendly staff. Kid friendly (triangular crayons!). And the food is decent.\n\nAny negatives? The entrees, while solid, don't have the impact of a true fine Italian restaurant. On this visit we ordered the Apple Gorgonzola Salad. It was enjoyed by all. The Chicken Cannelloni and the Chicken Marsala were great. The Baked Ziti, however, was dry and far from flavorful. Three out of four isn't bad I suppose. And a single mistake is less catastrophic since everything is being shared family style anyway.\n\nWe had two children in our group and felt pressured to pop for the $4.99 kid's Cioccolata and Pisa Punch served in glasses with flashing lights in their base. The lids were poorly designed, subject to spillage around the straw, but the kids did enjoy the beverages. $10 of enjoyment? Well. At least refills were free. \n\nOrdering the right amount of food from the family style menu can be tricky. The portions are generous, so it's easy to order too much. For example, our server's recommendation to share a small salad for four adults was perfect, even though the written menu would have suggested the larger size. I'd recommend getting some friends together and ordering several small entrees for variety,\n\nI'd also recommend just letting kids share the adult family style entrees rather than ordering from the children's menu (unless they just have to have macaroni and cheese). The four and five year olds in our party were fine with it and it helped them feel fully part of the group. They weren't quite as supportive, however, when we refused to order the giant brownie sundae. I was willing, but..."
0,"over-priced and gross. \""medium rare\"" ribeye steak came out looking like the burned & dried out sole of a shoe.\n\nthey get some bonus points for honesty. when i ordered a margarita, the waitress advised against it. \""they're not good. our sour mix is really bad\"" wow. \n\nstay away from this place. there are so many better options elsewhere.\n\nalso, the salad bar was more of a slop bar. all the \""salad\"" choices were drowning in sloppy oil. and guess what? THERE WAS NO LETTUCE AVAILABLE. what the f?"
3,"Just moved to AZ and found this place on Yelp!\n\nHard to find someone who can do Men's mani/pedis but this place did a fantastic job!!!\n\nOnly things I didn't like were: \n\n1:It was priced about $13 more ($48+tip for men's mani/pedi here) than what I usually pay. \nAnd 2: No jets on the feet tubs; however they Rubber Duckie they put in the tub made up for no bubbles!!! LoLz!!!\n\nI had 2 different girls and they each did a fantastic job. I will definitely be coming here regularly. \n\nWhat's up with nail places asking for \""memberships\""???  Hmph....\n\n(First Yelp Post!!!)"
4,"I have only gone to Postino during the Monday/Tuesday $20 nights where you get a bottle of wine and choice of 3 bruschettas for the cheap price of $20.  I always order a bottle of moscato d'asti and a trio of Brie & Apples with fig, Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and Fresh Mozzarella with tomato and basil.  I usually go with a few of my girlfriends and this makes a great meal with fantastic wine and some good gossip. :)  Come early as seats fill up extremely quickly and the wait can get very long.  This deal starts after 8pm."
2,"Years ago, I thought McCarran was one of the best airports around.  Not because it was fancy or nice (cuz it's mostly not), but because they have slot machines by the gates!  Certainly beats just sitting around (though it's potentially quite a bit more expensive...).  I even remember telling myself that \""if I were to ever have a long delay, I would want it to be here\"".  \n\nFast forward years later and I realized...I wanted to kick my own ass for jinxing myself.  A nine hour delay and a terrible hangover will do that to you.  The food vouchers we were given helped, but there weren't a lot of appetizing options near our gate to spend them on.  A sub shop and Starbucks were just about it.\n\nFast forward another few years and I was pleasantly surprised to see Virgin America had been moved into the newly built Terminal 3.  Needless to say, it's a huge improvement and much more appealing to fly in and out of - better dining options, spacious and clean, and a ton of outlets for charging devices.\n\nSince it was built detached from the main/older airport terminals though, splitting cabs isn't as convenient as it used to be if you're not going to the same terminal.  There's no direct access by foot between the two and the cab fare going from one to the other runs about $5-10 (though there's a shuttle between the two).  Seems pretty crazy to me!  Unless I was taken for a ride...\n\nBTW, ever notice how you arrive amped up and happy, but end up leaving beaten and exhausted?  Never fails."
2,"I needed a Saturday night out that wasn't going to break the bank so my friend Dawn C. suggested we start out at Blush because they pour free champagne for ladies from 11 to midnight. We did not bother with a guest list, being two local ladies we had no problem waltzing right in for free. \n\nBlush is small but not stuffy. The outside patio is really nice, we claimed a VIP table for a bit since no one else was sitting there which was cool, had a place to set our stuff while we chatted... When we were eventually asked to move the person that did so was real chill about it, no attitude at all. The bathroom attendant was nice as well, helpful without being all in your way. \n\nThe scene was a little older, music was a little funky... Whoever was DJing played Rick Springfield's 'Jessie's Girl' which always makes me laugh but not really clubbing music in my opinion. \n\nGood place to get the night started."
2,"In town for the weekend and this place seemed like it could have potential. The food is homemade and the workers are nice. I ordered three pupusas: Loroco con queso, black beans and cheese and one with chicharron. They were good, but the didn't have as much in the middle as I am used to. Overall it was good, but I have had many much better pupusas."
4,"It's definitely a different experience. Nick, the owner was wonderful. The front desk girl was awesome as well. They gave us quite a bit of hits since the time was running out.  I can't wait to get another opportunity to go back and try another room when my brain is working a little better.  (We had 2 players; it would be a little bit more doable with at least 4-6 people, Nick told us)."
0,We love Hennessey's.  Been to several in SoCal.  I was really looking forward to lunch there.  Our beer order was taken within minutes.  A different waitress introduced herself and confirmed our order about five minutes after that but she had the order backwards.  A few minutes later our drinks were poured and set up at the waiters station to be delivered.  That's as far as the got.  We watched our beers get warm and flat for easily ten minutes and no one brought them to us.  I felt that we became invisible.  Our food order was never taken.  We saw another couple sit and leave because no one even talked to them.  The restaurant was not crowded and there were several employees there. Our drinks didn't come so we left.
3,"We came here cuz someone in our group knew the owner.\n\nParty of 9.\n\nArrived:\nManager: What would you like to order?\nUs: Beer! The one in the special Keg..2 kegs to be exact.\nManager: Alright...any food. How about we start with appetizers. How about roti canai, X, y, z. \nUs: Sure, hm...can we order all of the appetizers on the menu to make things easier on you?\nManager: okay...what would you like for entrees?\nUs: Why don't you just surprise us?\n\nBottom line: Great food, from appetizers, to entr\u00e9es and dessert, to alcohol ! A little off the strip but worth a visit if you are craving for Thai/Chinese fusion food. The manager ordered the perfect amount for us and the food overall was 4/5! Service was great too!"
1,"Once upon a time...before profiteering became more important than product, there were a lot of good food items to be had.   Anyone remember when Twinkies or Ho Ho's actually tasted like food, and not like chemical compounds?\n\nWell, the same applies to Primanti Brothers.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a little sandwich shop in Pittsburgh that was trying very hard to be like the famous steak sandwich shops in Philly.  After all, Pittsburgh really wasn't (and still isn't) 'known' for anything other than dirty steel mills, followed closely by closed steel mills, and the mill workers who sat around waiting for them to reopen, even after they'd been torn down and the property turned into malls.\n\nPrimanti Brother at one time was a decent sandwich shop with a quirky gimmick.  They put your sides ON the sandwich.  Yes, you could get a steak sandwich piled high with your favorites...french fries and cole slaw...in addition to the usual lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and cheese.\n\nAs time rolled by, the restaurants sprang up in several locations around the city, primarily anywhere that there might be a mall nearby, or a bunch of drunks who really didn't care WHAT they were eating, and there even sprang up one of the shops in Ft. Lauderdale.\n\nAs the business grew, the Primanti Brothers started cutting corners to maximize profits.  The meat became nothing more than Steak-Ums, and they started adding everything under the sun that could be served on a bun to their menu to try to draw in more people.  A nice healthy chicken breast...grilled in the same grease as everything else and topped with fries and cole slaw. \n\nNow, anyone not from Pittsburgh should know...native Pittsburghers are not exactly known for having distinguished tastes...in anything.  In fact, people in Pittsburgh will stand and give a raving standing ovation and scream 'faaaaabulous'...for what most folks around the country in more metropolitan cities would say 'eh'.\n\nLast year, I had jury duty.  The Pittsburgh Courthouse is located near one of the many Primanti grease pits.  I thought I'd try a fish sandwich since I was on a limited budget for the day, and time was too short to sit down in any other restaurant.\n\nGreasy, didn't taste much like fish, the batter was soggy from the grease, the cheese clearly came in little squares from a plastic package, and even the tartar sauce couldn't make it more palatable.  My stomach felt rock laden the rest of the day.\n\nMore recently, a couple from San Francisco came into the store where I work, which is near one of the Primanti restaurants.  They'd heard all the hype, and had lunch.\n\nThe woman said to me: \""WHAT is up with Primanti?  Everyone kept telling us we had to have a Primanti while we were in Pittsburgh!\""\n\nShe looked at me, rolled her eyes, stuck out her tongue and said:  \""Bleeech!\""\n\nI shrugged my shoulders and told her I agreed.\n\nI guess we could say that Primanti is kind of the White Castle of Pittsburgh, only with more \""GOOOO Steelers\"" - ambience.\n\nIt is best eaten after a drunken bender, when you aren't really hungry, but are the type to eat like you're at a trough after guzzling half a keg of beer.\n\nOr...you think McD's is fine dining.\n\nDon't buy the hype.  The gimmick of the fries and slaw on the sandwich doesn't make it a decent meal.  Just means you're gullible to local yokel advertising.  And sadly, there really isn't another thing in Pittsburgh that stands out."
4,"04/29/1  Updated review 5 stars\nWell we have had the doors for well over year and I must say it's been one of our better investments. Other than the initial problems with the locks, they have held up well and look great. It's a pity we didn't have them installed years earlier. We can safely lock the 2 outside doors and leave our main front and back doors open all night to let a through breeze. It's great. \n\n\n12/1/13 update review (4 x star)\nLocks seem to be holding up well and very happy with the doors otherwise.\n\n11/7/13 updated review (3 x star):\nFirst Impressions finally did the right thing and sent out a more experienced technician. Both locks repaired without fuss. I guess the first technician they sent was very weak and gave me the run around with some ridiculous stories. I must admit I do like the quality of the doors and install was good. So not sure whether or not I should over-look this hiccup in service. upgraded from 1 x star to 3 stars. If the locks hold up i will move up to 4 stars\n\n\nInitial Review: (1 x star):\nNice doors and good initial install. However, we have had a lot of problems with the locks. Key wouldn't come out when fully turned. We had the service guy come out and he said he couldn't replace the lock until it fully fails!!!  We have to go through all kinds of contortions to get the keys out - it seems it has to be aligned up and down correctly before you withdraw the key. Now the front door is doing the same thing.  That's just totally ridiculous... and incredibly frustrating. The doors are only approx less than a year old.\n\nIf I had read all the bad reviews I see on Yelp about this company  - I should have gone elsewhere - stupid me for not looking first....."
0,"Seems from the reviews that more than my mother-in-law have been screwed over by this location and false reports of damage. I would steer clear or take pictures of every inch of the car, before and after renting."
3,"Good little neighborhood joint.  The food is good, the pours are reasonable, and the bar top is one awesome hunk of wood.  The decor is that of a golf nut, as the owner a Scots expat.  They've got a loyalty card of sorts and offer specials regularly."
3,"I have been a member since this location opened. New machines, very clean and helpful staff. Planet Fitness caters to the gym-goer that doesn't use a ton of free weights. They are known to have the \""Judgment Free Zone\"" which helps their members feel less intimidated by the extreme weight lifters. If you are looking to get in shape and on a budget this place does the job. For $10 a month you get a clean gym with lots of machines and open 24 hours a day so their is no excuse not to get into shape."
2,"Breakfast on a busy Sunday morning. Service was really good. All staff was friendly and followed up on requests quickly.\n\nI thought it was overly expensive - $10 for 2 eggs, ham/bacon/sausage and pancakes/waffles. C'mon - it's not that expensive to make breakfast! I will say the meat was excellent, but eggs were eggs and the waffle was dry, so dry. My friend had pancakes and those were also dry.\n\nThey have a $7.99 pick 3 option with a nice selection - but I would not get pancakes or waffles. I can only imagine the biscuits would be dry, too.\n\nI wanted to like this place. It was in a nice part of town. It was cute inside. The patio was nice. The food just won't bring me back."
1,"Staff was ok except one. Went there during lunch hour and as we are getting ready to prepare our bowl. one of the members of their staff yells at me with an attitude \"" you cant be back here\"" what she is talking about the area between the 2 self serve veggie/ meat station. One bar was closed but with all the respect it is hard to reach to an item that is way in the back so I went to the other side to make it easier to reach and this girl yells at me from across instead of coming closer to me and warning me it is not allowed to be on the other side. How rude! what is ur location's goal here? go big or go home! I wont be visiting again."
2,Alright at best staff wasn't very helpful and food took along time for no one to be there...
3,"Ah Saturday in Vegas. Wet, some interesting versions of that was being rocked here at the grand opening. So I land check it to the room and first stop is the opening day. Cruise in on a guest list - means not having to pay $50 to get that day. What I liked was the size of the place and it didn't get crowded except one place. The bar. I felt it was unfairly understaffed. Prices were a bit jacked for the day also. $8 for a BL. Well that's opening day. Wet., lots of hot bodies were in the two pools; glistening bodies pool side having drinks or Wet as in the case of one gal grinding things and other gals like a dog on a leg. It was a sight. It was tough to sit but I am not complaining. The gals from Bada-Bing helped with that. So it was a good time. Just keep the sunscreen on. If the water seems salty, get out. Hope there are more bartenders down the road. There is waiting for a drink but there's a breaking point. Bartneders won't kill themsleves but the customers just might push and shove. Pictures to follow."
2,"I found this place by accident as it is tucked into the side of a small strip.  There is another place in the same strip but on the other end called Arivaderci....Don't ever go there....Their food is just bad....I only mention them to ensure there is no going to the wrong place!!\n  When I arrived at Giuseppe, I walked in the door and the inside was full but the outside patio area was completely empty.  As I appraoached the counter, the gentleman just said what can we do for you.....I was a little taken aback as I did not know how to answer that.  I figured usually when you walk into a restaurant, they say how many and seat you.  I literally said that I was there for dinner.  He then said I could sit out the patio if I wanted to.  So that is where I went.  I waited for  a while and a waiter finally appeared and took my drink order. Then came back witha menu.  He brought bread (which was totally dry and the \""herbed\"" butter was no more than butter with some parsley in it) and my drink and was gone again.  When he finally came back, I ordered meat ravioli.  That was brought out by someone else....I never saw my waiter again.  I had to wave through the window to get someone's attention to get my check....OK, the raviloi's were good, but the service sucked.  I guess I had to be one of the \""elite\"" customers inside to get anyone to even bring me another drink...I will probably attempt to go here again (I always like to give places a couple of chances before I totally discard them. )  First impressions are important.   Oh, and btw, the tines on my fork were so bent that I ended up having to press it against the table so I could use the fork....It is definitely \""down home\"" Italian.  One last thing, my name starts and ends with a vowel and has a vowel in the middle.....So I know great Italian....This is not great, but is pretty good. The prices are not all that wonderful either...Small portions for the price.\nOne thing no one mentioned....this is a cash only place, so no credit cards or checks.....Maybe it has something to do with tax collection...HMMMMM?"
3,"I was pleasantly surprised with Top of the World.  I didn't have high expectations because it was located in the Stratosphere, which admittedly isn't my favorite. We decided to give it go after seeing an online deal come up for it and I'm glad we did.\n\n The ambience is nice; the view of Las Vegas from the restaurant, as I'm sure goes without saying, is amazing. The service was also really great; our waiter was polite and attentive. We had a drink at the lounge upstairs while we waited for our table (the wait was much longer than they told us, but we were a no reservation walk-in, so no big deal).\n\n The food: We started with the Lobster Bisque, which was really, really good. The bread they brought out was served with a very inters testing orange ginger butter that we both really enjoyed. My girlfriend had the rack of lamb and I had the New York steak; both were of great quality, were cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. I will say that the food feels a little dated here; that isn't to say that it wasn't executed amazingly, because it was, but it felt a little less current than I might have expected and I think that some other reviewers might be giving it less credit because of that. \n\n It was well worth the price and I'm glad I finally made it there. The added bonus was that we were able to go to the observation deck (and to the rides) without paying the tower ticket ($12-$16 each)."
2,"I'm trying my hardest to not give this buffet a 2-star rating. Because honestly if you hover that tiny little mouse over the 2-star rating, it reads \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" And frankly, I have. Hands down my favorite buffet in Vegas so far is Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo (see my review for more about it) and taking second billing would be the Wynn Buffet (also reviewed).\n\nReason why I'm not giving it a 2 is because it's not horrible; I didn't get food poisoning, food wasn't tasteless, I didn't leave hungry. BUT I did regret what I paid for and felt absolutely disappointed in choosing to eat here. I understand that they're known for their wide variety of items to choose from which there were, but the quality of those items were pretty run of the mill. Chips and salsa. Mac and cheese. Your token \""Asian section\"" with chow mein and fried rice. The seafood section was lackluster. My cod was dry and bland. Probably the only food item I did like was their truffle scalloped potatoes. I went for seconds on that one - must have! But that's about it. Their dessert section didn't excite me. I think I ate all my custard cause it tasted like leche flan (shout out to all my Filipinos), sampled the rest of the desserts and pushed them to the side of my plate. Super wasteful but I pretty much saved other people's time from grabbing a sub-par dessert. You're welcome, Vegas patrons.\n\nYou expect grandeur at a place like this, well at least I did. Especially with this kind of price tag, you expect tiny ass rainbows to come shooting out of your eyes as you body roll in your seat making yummy noises. Sadly, none of these things happened. I was left rainbow less and my body refused to roll.\n\nI would not come back. Sorry, Bacchanal. I'm probably better off taking my money elsewhere... slots anyone?"
3,"Quality beer, decent food, good atmosphere, all at a reasonable price.  A great place to enjoy a pint with some rock climbing friends from the Phx Rock Gym (http://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenix-rock-gym-tempe)"
0,"This is the first club in the desert that I've been to. Unfortunately, it was not a good experience. I was cool that the club had two dancefloors, one side playing hip hop and the other playing electronic music. The outdoor patio was spacious and had a place to get more drinks. Good thing was drinks were free. Just tip the bartender generously and you can get drinks free all night. People on the upper level were making it rain. That's a first, ever. The crowd was very diverse. \n\nNow to the music. I would say the hip hop side was poppin. That side was always packed and constantly played good music. I listen to a lot of electronic music, but had no idea what was being played that night. All night it was just continuous thumps at the same tempo. The songs lacked extra purcussions of builds or climaxes to hype up the crowd. At least play something mainstream like atb, armin, darude, David Guetta, skrillex, avicii. Artists like that."
2,"Don't get me wrong, ice cream was good but dang $3.99 for a SMALL bowl.  Kiddos enjoyed it of course.  They had a good amount of seating in the small shop."
2,Whisky selection is limited. But food is good. Crusted calamari is a delicious appetizer
2,"I'm not a big Hallmark shopper.  It's too easy top buy cards almost anywhere else.  That being said, I wanted to get a card for a friend and since Amy's Hallmark is near my home, I drove here and got the card.\n\nAmy's has a good selection and is a typical Hallmark store.  I regret the move by Hallmark to make so many cards with sound.  Just give me a good, old fashioned card with a  nice saying.  Or give me something humorous without the razzle dazzle."
0,"Okay i was super hungry when i walked in, so i expected like the usual, 5, 6min wait on my order, but the princesses in the front were to busy making their orders from del taco and writing them to one of the coworkers who was going to get it for them, they LITERALLY forgot to serve the food to 3 of the order which one of them was mine, then after 15 min ridiculous wait i asked if my order was ready they were like: what did u get? \"" seriously???? They looked into my ticket and were like ohh okay, then i asked for a sauce,  she throws it in the platter!!! The worst costumer service ever, they messed orders and ppl started to get angry, these girls should not do costumer service."
3,"Being pretty much unknowledgable about the whole downtown scene, I figured I would check it out. Thanks to Yelp, Hanny's came to mind - so naturally I thought I would check it out. Walking in, I could already see, that thursday are far from their busiest night. Still the wait to be seated seemed to take about 10 mintues before someone even acknowledged my girl and I. But having the time to look at the place, I was somewhat impressed by their modern approach.\nLooking over their menu I saw it rather limited but roast beef caught my eye, while my gf got the pork seared special.  She had some sort of martini while I stuck with the Stella. I was surprised how small their martini glasses were, especially for the price. But trying to make a night out of this, I wasn't trying to complain. \nThe roast beef was rather tasteless and greesy and was regretful ordering it, I was rather jealous that my other half had a more enticing meal. But I still am attracted to Hanny's, maybe its the old school beats the DJ's were putting down, or the reclining seats or maybe the maze-like bathroom, or just how happy it made my girl to actually have a night out like this. But i give this place 4 stars not for the service or food, but more for the atmosphere... (and sick beats)"
4,Best grocery store in Vegas!
4,"My man does it again.  Have taken 5 jackets to him now to tailor.  He has advised me on brands to buy that fit my build, told me to pass on tailoring pieces that will never fit me correctly, and repeatedly deliver quality work.  Highly recommend."
1,"I finally had a chance to try out Joe's last night with my family.  I hate to say it (I really wanted to like the place) but I wasn't very impressed overall.  The food quality overall was very average, nothing stood out as phenomenal from any of our choices (we sampled from each other's plates).  Not to say anything was bad, just not superb.  The portions were a little small for the price.\n\nAll in all it was an okay experience, but the price ($40 for 2 adults and 2 kids) is high enough to keep us from going back."
4,"This family run business is the next best thing to dining by sunset in Hawaii!  First off, the place is immaculate beyond compare-and you always see the owners and servers tidying up a spotless shop.  The food is freshly prepared as you order-and delish doesn't begin to describe it.  You can indulge your whims with fried delights or maintain your calorie conscious ways with their grilled options like BBQ Chicken-my fave!  I am always greeted with a warm smile-and they know my order before I state it!  Great weekday lunch specials.  While I live on the other side of town, when I can it is one of my travel stops."
1,"OK, so we stumbled upon this place on a sleepy Sunday morning. I was so happy to see it, we were starving. Note: There are NO breakfast places along Shea Blvd....\n\nI didn't even notice the \""all local organic\"" thingy till we got inside. Nice I like that.\n\nI did notice a disgusting sewer smell. No, it was not eggs. Just as I was thinking \""maybe its me\"" a toddler voice shouted \""Mommy it stanks in here\"" Toddlers don't lie. It did stink.\n\nAs I prayed whatever it was that stunk would go away, I pondered the menu. Not extensive but alright: eggs, omelets, french toast, pancakes.\n\nThe stink did come and go, thank gawd it wasn't constant, I wouldn't have been able to handle that.\n\nI got the freshly squeezed OJ and it was great. I also ordered the French Toast. It sounded interesting as they use sourdough. Weird, right? It was weird. Not a fan of the sourness going through it. But it was nicely griddled and the syrup and delicious scoop of whipped butter helped. The eggs and bacon( a bit skimpy tho) on the side were very good, as were the hashbrowns I ordered on the side.\n\nHubs had the Popeye omelet, and my bite was very tasty.\n\nAll in all, a good place to go, but they really need to fix that sewer problemo."
2,"We ordered Mic Ultra, nice and cold! But the tri tip nachos were blah, no favor. I was disappointed, but I'll probably come again due to the quick service and beer on tap."
4,Best threading place in the valley- she has invented her own device to help threading. Instead of holding the thread in your mouth they put it around a necklace. Way more sanitary than the other places- great service great quality overall a fabulous place to go. The girls are very thorough when they see you. They have a stamp card too!
0,"I don't know why I keep coming here. The service is not good and their food isn't good. And they aren't even busy! \n\nI've been here about 6 times. Mostly take out and one dine in occasion.\n\nI've never had one of those experiences where I notice someone order AFTER me and still get their food first. Until here! \n\nI remember that occasion. We ordered a pizza, and two appetizers. Our pizza came out literally 45 minutes after ordering it, they bring the one appetizer another 5 minutes later, and then the second appetizer just about the hour mark. One of those that's it I'm leaving moments but I stuck it out. We were in there when there were maybe 2 other small parties were there so I just didn't understand. They had a lot of workers but we maybe got one refill when we asked after we ate. \n\nThere was never a \""sorry out kitchens baked up\"" or even a just plain \""sorry it's taking so long\"". That tells me they don't see a problem.\n\nHow hard is it to fry up some garlic balls to bring out as an appetizer? How about wings? That should have come out first to freaking offset the pizza wait! Restaurant and service 101!\n\nOur entire meal took almost an hour and a half. \n\nGranted the take out line started getting busy we still ordered way before it got busy.\n\nThen tonight I went and took a take out order and our crust was burnt on our pizza. \n\nSorry but that was the last straw. I just can't see myself eating here again.\n\nYes their garlic balls are good and cheap but I'll go elsewhere at all costs. \n\nTheir ordering sucks. You call and automatically get placed on hold. WHY?! I was in there and both girls did that. WHY?! They weren't even doing anything that couldn't wait!\n\nAlso the staff sucks.\n\nCustomer service and personality go along way. I don't see how that girl works there. She must be related or own the place. Dark hairs girl that is a little pale. Sorry to put her out there but she just sucks. One time she gave me a free ranch with my order but I left a tip larger than the cost of the ranch so that doesn't make up for it. \n\nThere's no appreciation of the customer. I'd rather eat where they have good service and good food as opposed to bad service and great food. \n\nThey don't give a good name to local businesses and I'd much rather eat at a big corporate chain as opposed to this place."
3,"I really like this restaurant.  The food is always good.  The salsa is nice and spicy and the service is fast and attentive.  It's a great place to take my entire family.\n\nI usually order the chicken fajitas, which are amazing.  I also love that they serve a complimentary bowl of soup with the standard chips and salsa.  Nice touch! The kids love it."
1,"I've been coming here for years with good to great service and great food. Today me and some good regulars left Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop with some SALTY ASS BALLS. YES... SALTY ASS BALLS.  There was definitely some miscommunication going on and we came up with the short end of the stick. \n\n\""Don\"", our waiter takes our order. We would like the Famous Prime Rib. \""We are TOTALLY OUT of prime rib\"". That statement says that there is no more in the vicinity. Weird because how can they be totally out when it is only lunch?  We order beef ribs, the surf and turf, and steak and eggs.  Less than 5 minutes later, the salads come out and the gentleman next to me orders the thick cut prime rib from our waiter, Don.  Interesting... \n\nWe get told after inquiring that the prime rib was not ready when we ordered it a few minutes ago, but IT'S READY NOW BITCHES!!!\n\nWe felt like we got bamboozled and the management wouldn't do anything to set things right. Don looked at his times on his receipts and said that the couple ordered it a good fifteen minutes after our orders. No sir, you typed that order in much later from when you actually \""took\"" their orders.   However long it takes to bring in a salad was when you took their orders Don.  It wasn't 15 minutes. At least your late ass ticket gets to cover your ass. \n\nIn the end, the management would not make things right with their paying regulars. Management gives us a comment card. PASHAAAAAAH!!!???!!!  I'm giving a very low rate because of the management. The food is great here. It really is. The \""waitresses\"" and \""bussers\"" are great  here too. Don is new and has RUINED our eating experience at one of our favorite lunch eateries. I'm going to miss this place..."
4,dang!!!! i love eating with my hands...and IT DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS!!!
4,"Discovered this little truck during the Vegas StrEATS fest and it did NOT disappoint!  The wait was like 45 minutes, but so worth it.\n\nThis isn't snow cone land, the ice consistency is smooth and sleek. It's a different texture.\n\nThe Large is $5 and the Regular is $4.\n\nYou can choose up to 3 flavors per Shave Ice. They have approximately 30+ flavors to choose. From classics like cherry and bubblegum (regular and blue) to traditional Hawaii flavors, to several types of cakes. \n\nSome add ons like ice cream and sour spray and other stuff I don't recall are only .50 to $1 to add. Condensed milk is free (if you've never had condensed milk on a snowy treat, do it; you are welcome). \n\nThey have a Twitter so you can find them on the go and webpage they update! Definitely check it out. One of the cheapest and tastiest ways to beat the Summer heat in Vegas!"
1,"I would prefer not to eat here again.  'Too bad it's right next door to my office building, so out of convenience and variety, I probably WILL eat here again.  :-(  I find the food over-priced for being so bland.  The sandwiches are stuffed with massive quantities of over-processed, sliced meat product, and so you can't really taste the rest of the sandwich ingredients.  The cookies are pretty decent, and the service is attentive.  Since I hate the burned taste of coffee, I can't speak to those products, nor to their soups."
4,"Green Leopard Graphics on a scale of 1-10 is beyond a 10.  I don't even know where to start with this company.  1. They are very professional, reliable, and very well priced for the outstanding quality of work you receive.  \nI have gone through a lot of different printing services who lag on time, say they will have a proof to you my a certain time, or date, never hear from them, etc. \nGreen Leopard has helped my business get amazing exposure with designs of business cards, fliers, they are currently working on a design for an A-Frame, and a design for a wrap.  I strongly recommend this company to anyone who wants a quick reliable and honest service."
3,"Lobbys first grabbed my eye when dropping off a Blockbuster movie. The location had been vacant for some time after Extreme Pita left. I was excited to hear this was a burger place. \n\nI finally gave the place a try tonight and wasn't disappointed. I had the double burger with cheese. All burgers come with lettuce, tomato, onion, large pickles slices and homemade sauce on a sesame bun.\n\nThe meat is high quality (not frozen), seasoned  and cooked to perfection. Topped with cheese and you have a real delight. After I ate my burger, I wish I had more! \n\nI'm a big fan of the crinkle cut french fries. I haven't had those in a LONG time. I found the fries a bit too salty. I like salt on my fries, but this was a tad much. You receive a very large portion of fries (perfect for me). You could probably even split the fries with another person if you wanted. \n\nYou can make any meal a combo meal (fries/drink) for $2.79 more.\n\nThe price of the burgers and hots dogs are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting.  Based on the size you order, you're looking  at $4-6.50 w/o cheese.\n\nI do wish there was more than just 1 size of drink and not in a styrofoam container. I could go for something a little smaller than a super big gulf size-32 oz.\n\nI hope this place does well as they make great food. This isn't an ideal location unless you know about the place, but I think Lobbys can do well with some more publicity and word of mouth.  The reviews on Yelp are a good start.\n\nIf you like burgers as much as I do, give this place a shot! \n\n4.5 stars!"
1,"This place only gets 2 stars because of the nice suites. Everything else about this place sucks. It's a family place and we brought our relatives, but despite the spotty shuttle service that ends at 12:15am it's a good drive to the strip.\n\nEverything at this hotel shuts down at 10pm. The expensive grill and bar shut down, the pool shuts down, you can't even use your room's whirlpool after 10pm because of the \""noise\"". Another pet peeve I had is the $100 deposit you need before you can even check in. It's to be expected, but the gave us no warning and it caused some trouble when my family needed to check into their room.\n\nEven if you're looking for a family friendly place, this place isn't the greatest choice amenity wise. Great rooms though!"
4,"In L.A. I give the nod to Nozawa... But this ain't L.A., this is Vegas, and the taste is beyond compare!  I ate my admission price to Absinthe that night but loved every minute of 2 hours I was there!"
4,Heard about this place opening on yahoo and had to go check it out. I saw the owner compete on food network years ago and have always wanted try his pizza. The pizza defiantly didn't disappoint. Plus it was free on top of that cause they were running trials at that time. I love how they are revamping the down town area and this place if defiantly is a must if you coming to vegas or you're from Vegas.
1,"I'm sitting here as I write this.I'm thoroughly unimpressed. \n\nWith its bare white walls and sparse attempts at decor, this place is overly and unreasonably obnoxious. Despite not being crowded, and there never being more than one person in front of me each time, I had to wait on line.  With two people working behind the counter there's no reason to forget my order or make me wait 5+ minutes each time I needed something (to get my coffee, to ask for the Internet password, and then to remind them that I ordered coffee). Unfortunately the coffee supplied was  mediocre as best. Disruptive music selection that was too damn loud. Annoying..thank God for pandora.com, a good set of ear-bud, and reasonable wi-fi or I never would have gotten any work done.\n\nThe only reason I'd come back here is if my son had another concert to attend nearby. Needless to say, I do not recommend."
2,This spot is super unique and a great edition to Las Vegas. Even if you just go for dinner you are going to get the full bowling and concert experience because the open floor plan allows you to see everything. I'm rating my experience a 3 because the food was just alright. My red beans and rice were pretty dry and I was pining for more of the bean gravy. If I return I will definitely order the BLT. That thing was ginormous! If u want to go eat and bowl beware that there was a descrepancy between the hostess and server to whether or not they would carry over our tab to the bowling alley. Just plan ahead :)
0,"I bought a deal with groupon for this salon and called and left a message to schedule an appointment . I didn't receive a call back until 4 days later... We play tag calling each other back and forth, she never NEVER available to take my call!!!not only was it annoying, it was extremely rude. We finally scheduled an appointment for the next month, I waited at least 3 weeks for my appointment witch she wasn't available on weekends so I took a day off of work. Turns out the stylist was sick that day so I took off work for nothing. After that I called to reschedule about 500 times I realized how unprofessional this salon was and decided to leave a voicemail expressing my feelings and only then is when I got a prompt response. I told her I needed a refund and she was no help, just told me I need to talk to groupon. I highly recommend taking your business elsewhere this busy lady obviously doesn't have time for you, so unprofessional......"
1,"We had reservations for dinner prior to attended a performance at the Smith Center. It was Sunday and there were performances in 2 theaters. We arrived 15 minutes early and the restaurant was packed. Our hostess was telling walk-ins that they were filled up and the only seating available was on the patio. Our hostess took us to a small table with no lighting and we felt that it would not be possible to read the menu. We asked for another table and one that I pointed out was not available since the table was broken, (Lost Revenue!!). We were offered another table that seated 4 people which was difficult getting into but satisfactory. The d\u00e9cor is artsy, nice tables like artist palettes and fits in with the neighborhood. \n\nService\nOur waitress asked if we were going to the Smith Center and since we were she would get us out quickly. It appeared from the customer's attire everyone was going to the Smith Center. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and dinner at the same time. It seemed like a long wait for the wine about 10 minutes. After a while I asked the waitress about our wine and she said there was only 1 bartender and things were backed up. My wife ordered the French Onion Soup as an entr\u00e9e and I ordered the Barramundi Sea Bass. The French Onion Soup came out separate from the Sea Bass. I waited 10 minutes before asking a passing waiter to check on my entr\u00e9e. He immediately bought it to the table. I wonder if it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to be picked up. Upon arrival I asked why both dinners were not brought out together and the response was the fish takes longer than the soup. I repeated the question and the waiter agreed that they should have been brought together. It appears the restaurant is overwhelmed by the amount of business from the Smith Center.\n\nFood\nThe soup was warm not hot and since it arrived early my wife ate it since it would have been cold if she waited for my dinner. The soup was tasty with a good sweetness to the onions. My entr\u00e9e was very good. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a tasty sauce.\n\nIf not for the service issues, I would award Bar + Bistro 4 stars. It might be interesting to go there on a non theater night. Bar + Bistro is a nice addition to the Las Vegas Arts District. \nOne final comment our waitress did not ask if we would like dessert."
3,Om-a-nom-a-nom-a-nom\n\nFood was good and the service was great.  Very relaxed and laid back atmosphere.  I was there at the tail end of the lunch rush during a week day with some out of town friends.  Had a calzone that was piping hot and delicious!  I'll definitely be back to try their pizza.
4,I didn't know what to expect but I couldn't stop laughing the entire time. I loved the show!
0,"What I get for not having the energy to check Yelp before dining somewhere is a mediocre meal like we had here.  We just walked by and randomly decided to dine here.  The hostess and our waitress were very kind - but the service was SLOW and the food bland.  Dressing up all the ladies in skimpy clothes does not make the food taste any better.  Their kitchen also needs to learn how to marinate foods or use sauces to their advantage.  Here's a quick breakdown: \n\n- bone marrow - so bland and not worth it.  The bones are not cut lengthwise, so the unseasoned marrow is deep and hard to get to.  \n- chicken panini - the chicken was dry from being over cooked and it was under seasoned.  The panini could have used some spread or sauce inside since it was very dry and bland.\n- fish and chips - the fish was okay but the fries were all little bits in both my husband and brother's order of it - it looked like they got the very bottom of the bag of frozen fries.\n\nMy recommendation is to move onto another restaurant...sorry Alexandre Restaurant."
1,"As part of our Vegas on a budget, my sisters and I stopped here on Saturday and ended up having the buffet so that we could try the house specialties like the Biria, Chile Colorado, Carnitas and Camerones...that and the $13.95 price tag came with unlimited margaritas. We chose Lindo Michoacan because it has won Best of Vegas for Mexican food for many years in a row. I have a hard time believing this is the best Vegas has to offer. The food was very average. The house-made tortillas were good, the specialties mostly bland, the margaritas were made with Sweet and Sour and were very generic. Their house salsa served with chips is very poor. Our server was very courteous and efficient, but there was little for him to do, since we were mostly serving ourselves."
3,"Pros: Super sweet and delicious cakes, ice cream, and truffles.  \n\nCons: It can be a tad bit too sweet for me, after a couple bites I'm done.\n\nRed Velvet cake is definitely my favorite and so is their washroom - mirrors everywhere and very clean."
2,finally found a dish i like a bws.  i get the honey mustard salad which is tasty.  since my husband is a fan of bws i'll be back.
3,"I was a sushi virgin and based on the reviews this was probably the wrong place to pop my cherry.  But I did and it was simply alright.  I had the california rolls which were edible and I ate the entire thing.  I smothered them in soy sauce and focused on the rice.   The only problem was it was really dark and I thought the dollop of wasabi was a stray slice of avocado so my first bite was an entire mouthful of wasabi which made me nearly double over in mouth-searing agony.  I flailed frantically until I found my beer which I promptly inhaled as a means of quenching the tartar-esque inferno raging in my mouth. \n\nAfter I quenched it, I managed to choke down the rest of the rice, avocado and partially uncooked fish.  The sum of my experience is the unshakable notion that people don't really like sushi.  It's not as good as real fish and it's dangerous and more than a little creepy.  I think this is one of those foods you pretend to like in order to seem cool.  But, hey, I'm just a burger guy.\n\nThe service was great, my waittress pleasant and the vibe pretty cool for a cheesey college scene.  Plus the Sunday happy hour is very reasonably priced."
4,"Charlotte's number 1 trusted indoor dog daycare and boarding facility. Owner Nicole takes pride in every aspect of the business including extended service to help rescued dogs. There's a big reason Dogtopia has won the Best Of award. All animals must be vaccinated prior to using the facility. Services also include grooming. My dogs, #MecklenDog & #Mr704, are proud to support them. We hope you do too."
2,"I used to hate Carly's.  I couldn't see the appeal.  The service is always abysmally slow.  The seasonal tap is always empty - half the time the servers don't even know what it is supposed to be filled with.  The food is... okay.  A few of the sandwiches are really good, but the vegetarian and vegan options are pretty bland - when I started eating meat again, I started liking the food here a lot more.\n\nThe place has grown on me the past couple years, though.  They've started hiring some pretty good musicians.  The food has been stepped up a little bit.  Unlike the Lost Leaf or Roosevelt, the place is big enough to accommodate a healthy crowd without making conversation impossible.\n\nI guess I now feel that Carly's is A-OK.  Accept the fact that they aren't trying particularly hard, and you'll be able to enjoy the convenience and relatively low price of it all."
2,I love shopping at Costco. Great prices and the best bakery. Only down side is when I went to get something to eat there the woman behind the counter was yelling at us and rolled her eyes when we said we needed a minute. There was nobody behind us in line. No need for the attitude
0,"So I visit this store at least once a day while I am at work, sometimes twice a day, so I thought things could only get better........ I guess I couldn't have been more wrong :-/ \nSo I have long since given up on them learning my name (at least at this store) and as for memorizing my drink, I guess that's certainly out of the question, because we all know how hard it is to remember a Grande black coffee!! I rarely order anything else, because when I do they always seem to get it wrong. For some reason this store can't seem to understand what you mean when you order \""non-fat\"" and then when you correct them on it, they get upset that they have to remake your drink. \nBut today was the creme de la creme of crappiness at this location! I went in and ordered my usual Grande black coffee, and the barista told me that they didn't have any brewed, so he started brewing some and then charged me the $2.11. He then proceeded to help the next few people in line and of course he completely forgot about my coffee. So about 10 minutes later I went back up to the counter and asked if my coffee was ready and he said \""oh yeah\"" and he poured my coffee and then instead of giving me my coffee, he proceeded to to walk over to another barista and have a random chat with her while holding my coffee?! When he finally did make his way to the counter, I grabbed my coffee and started to walk out. It was at that point he began talking to the other baristas and the people in line about how I didn't pay for my coffee!!!  Was he actually serious!! I only wished he hadn't wasted my whole entire lunch break waiting for my coffee because I would have tore into him! \nDear tall barista at Sbux thanks for being such a jerk today and ruining my lunch break! \nWORST SBUX EVER!!!"
3,"It's 3:30am and after karaoke-ing, Lebanese food sounded like a perfect way to end the night. \n\nBoustan's is a teeny eatery situated downstairs from a nightclub, a spot where all the drunkies go to post partying. \n\nOh but boustan's isn't just good for post-drunk meal, (i.e. dennys lol), their food is absolutely delicious.\n\nThe staff looks like they've been there for too long, but hey they're doing something right with their food.\n\nTried their potatoes had this yummy creamy garlic sauce atop. Also tried their chicken shwarma pita. The pita was toasted warm, crunchy on the outside, and soft inside. Their mix of veggies they throw in there definitely adds more life to that pita. \n\nOne thing I didn't fancy was that they went overboard with their garlic mayo sauce. Wayyy too much of that in there, but you'd hate to ask for an amended version because the main guy here reminds you of the soup nazi. Like, this ain't BK, it would almost be rude to have it your way. Nonetheless, all the food was good, and cheap.\n\nBetter than many of the LA spots that serve similar food, but certainly still not the best. Solid 4 stars here."
1,"I don't think this place is as great as they say it is.  It's pretty dirty.  Teachers don't pay that close attention.  Our child went here because everyone we knew had their kids here as it was some what reasonable but since being here, we've found so much better.  It's certainly not worth 4+ stars."
2,"Parking is a madhouse on weekends at this chic Chandler mall, which is the equivalent to Scottsdale Fashion Square (it has a lot of the same stores!). And don't even think about coming here during the holiday season unless you have a helmet.\n\nIf you can deal with the crowds or have a job where you can get away during the week, then the mall isn't all that bad. Infact, it's pretty darn nice. It's classy for Chandler and features some cool nightspots like Kona Grill and the Red Kilt Grill & Pub. And shopping IS fun here when you're not battling the crowds. There's also an Aveda, Buckle, Coach,  Guess and White House Black Market. Check out chandlermall.com for a full mall store listing."
1,"I did not have the same experience as many of these other reviewers which is surprising.  I met a colleague here for breakfast during the week and we were greeted promptly - service was fine.  I ordered the Petunia Pig omelet and my colleague ordered the Corn Beef Hash.  The food portions were big, but the taste was lacking.  My eggs were a bit overcooked and did not have enough cheese or meat in the omelet.  The \""homemade potato chips\"" which accompanied the dish were nothing special - would have preferred hash browns.  The toast was dry.  I just wasn't impressed.  I've had many other breakfasts here in Vegas including the other Omelet House in Henderson (which was great).  Not sure what went wrong today."
4,This is a small restaurant that appears to be run by the owners.  My husband and I go there often and have always been treated well.  The japanese lasagna roll they make is the best I've found here and in Southern California.  My husband likes their tempura udon soup and claims the maguro tuna is fresh.  This has become our 'go to' sushi place.
1,"Good, average food. Not the greatest but it hits the spot. 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate up the road has some fancier dishes, a little more tasty, but you get what you expect here."
0,"I've been to this place twice before and thought that maybe the 3rd times a charm right? WRONG!! Food was cold and any of the meat was hard as a rock. We were told upon entering that we couldn't have the seafood due to a large group( 3 BUS LOADS of tourists) that was in their banquet room. Their \""sushi\"" selection was disgusting. I think I would have had better luck with 7-11 sushi. Absolutely horrible. NEVER returning. I swear the buffet just up the road is the same price for a much better quality of buffet. Very disappointed."
0,"This is the worst seafood buffet I have ever eaten at, and for the money, the worst buffet I've ever tried. All the white fish tasted the same no matter how they seasoned it and was dry. The seafood pasta was gross. Half the problem is the food doesn't turn over fast enough and it sits out in the buffet way to long. Probably because the food sucks and they can never get enough people at the buffet to eat it. The lobster tails sat in this weird broth and looked disgusting. They had this italian NY steak that was as tough as shoe leather....nothing was good here...nothing! I wouldn't pay $10 dollars for this buffet and would rather pay for a meal at the Red Lobster (which is almost as bad) than eat for free at this dump."
4,"YAY SUSHI! I've been to the location on Paradise a number of times, but I had yet to visit this one (even though it's closer to home.) I placed an order for pick-up, which was waiting on a nearby table when I arrived. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant looks exactly like the Paradise location, but about two or three times bigger. All of the food is excellent. I've brought people who have eaten sushi in Japan and people who have never tried sushi and so far, everyone has enjoyed the food at Kaizen. My BFF's fiance swore he hated sushi until he agreed to try a chicken teriyaki roll. Now he's hooked. That's what Kaizen does to people.\n\nAlthough there aren't a ton of vegetarian rolls, the few they have are excellent. They offer a vegetable tempura roll and a shiitake mushroom tempura roll that are just to die for. \n\nThe best part is definitely the dessert menu. They have green tea and red bean ice cream and FIVE types of mochi ice cream! \n\nOverall, great restaurant. I really like the variety on the menu, and the service is always good. Plus, it's open super late (like, 3 a.m.)"
1,Pizza was just OK. Have high expectations  when places try to beat New York pizza. Ice cream also was OK. Have had better gelato. Think it was more ice cream than gelato. The best thing I got was the argula salad with prosciutto. Would definitely go back for that.
1,"I describe Olives as a huge disappointment.  It has the formula to be a great restaurant.  There are friendly hostesses seating you on time for your reservation in a beautifully appointed dining room, a nice drink/wine list, and an interesting menu.  However, the execution is terrible or at least it was for our dinner experience on a Friday night.\n\nFirst of all, we were seated or crammed into a table about a foot and a half away from people on each side.  Second, we did not get our drinks for fifteen minutes and did not even get water for ten.  When our waiter finally appeared, he told us how busy he was and tried to get sympathy because some old man was demanding.  Okay, we gave him the benefit of the doubt until I asked him a question about the menu and his answer was, \""You know, I am going to have come back because I really need to wait on that table.\""  So much for us sitting there not being helped for fifteen minutes...ugh.\n\nWith regards to the food, it was above average.  The bread and olive tapenade was commendable.  The boston bibb salad fell in the alright category.  The true winner for us was the portobello flatbread.  I can imagine that if I would have had a salad and flatbread for lunch, I would probably be writing a much better review.  Then, my husband had the risotto special and I had the halibut.  The fish was flaky and quite tasty, but I could not even dent it, it was so large.  The risotto was undercooked and lacked pizazz.\n\nAll in all, a disappointing experience and not one living up to the name or price of Todd English.  I think it is time for him to drop in on his Vegas restaurant to see how things are going."
0,"No thank you. This was the worst service that we've ever received.\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!\n\nI REPEAT...\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!!\n\nTHIS IS A HORROR STORY!\n\nWe contacted them about a promotion that we received in the mail. We booked two double-bed rooms over the phone. We were really excited about staying at this new hotel. We had heard that it was beautiful and lively. They gave us great customer service when we called. It sounded so awesome that even my brother and his family wanted to go! They asked if I can call and book one more room.\n\nSo I called and asked to try and see if we can book one more double-bed room. They said they were more than happy to book one more double-bed room! We just had to pay an extra 30$. Great. \""Will the rooms be close to each other?\"" No because the other two rooms are single-bed rooms. Hmmm...that's not what we booked and what the sales girl told me. So they told me that I had to pay an extra 30$ per room for the double bed. Fine. I'll pay it but I am not happy that I was misled to begin with. I want to talk to the girl who gave me the wrong information or her supervisor to file a complaint. If I hadn't called back and added the additional room I would have showed up with 8 adults and 1 infant with two beds only?\n\nWell, nobody ever called me back. Whatever. And I showed up with three parties. But we were informed that...we all had single bed-rooms?\n\nAll double bed-rooms in the hotel are booked. On December 28th? Tuesday? Really?\n\nNow I'm pissed.\n\nI want to raise hell! I want to talk to the manager! I want to talk to the salesperson who signed us up for the room. I want someone to make this right! I want double-beds so we don't have to sleep on the floor. The supervisor in-charge told us to sleep in our room that night and tomorrow they would contact us when rooms opened up.\n\nWell, as you could have guessed that never happened...\n\nI had over 15 people at that hotel! We slept there, ate there, and bathed there. We gambled there. We spent a lot of money there. And all I wanted was for someone to keep their promise and follow through. When I contacted the front office they said they had no record of any complaints and they would call us back if a double-bed room opened up...\n\nI doubt that.\n\nI asked for the general manager's name and they gave me her name and number. Awesome. So I ask a couple of people on the casino floor about the general manager and just kind of want to get an idea of what kind of person she was...\n\nAlison Lopez, General Manager.\n\nThey had never heard of her.\n\nThey had fooled me for what felt like the 100th time. I had NO peace of mind. I will never stay there again. I still am having trouble contacting any kind of management. Nobody can follow-up with their customers. For regular Vegas visitors, we have NEVER felt more disrespected. I'm still trying to contact Alison Lopez...no one knows who she is.\n\nFront desk girl name was Vanessa, second phone salesman was Alan, supervisor was Eva. All terrible and misleading.\n\nPlease do not stay at this hotel. And if you do, just call and verify your information. This was a NIGHTMARE.\n\nBy the way, we did not get any kind of housekeeping over 3 nights here. This was minimal compared to the other problems but still..."
3,"I had the opportunity to visit Mickie's when I was in Madison visiting my girlfriend. I like the old school 1950's lunch-counter vibe. The portions are huge and the food taste like its prepared from scratch. That being said, it's just \""ok.\"" I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for that statement, but its true. If you can't get into Mickie's (its a small restaurant, so the wait time can be pretty long), try Ella's Deli. That place has good breakfast too and a ton of character."
2,"Fun environment, good service.\n\nIf you are tired of high prices for average drinks, then this is another place to bring a flask to. I did not see a single tap and the beers are kinda standard; nothing to exciting and prices just over reasonable.\n\nBeen there 3 times and the bartenders are attentive and helpful. One bartender accidentally gave me too many beers in a bucket and other other politely explained to me that \""she gave you an extra, enjoy it and don't worry, but I didn't want you to be surprised when there is 1 less next time.\"" This is a situation that makes guest service snobs like me very proud to give an establishment by business."
3,"Each time we have gone to this lounge, the drinks have been awesome (long island ice tea, mojito, and some stiff jack on the rocks). Lingo even came back on several occasions to make sure that our drinks were satisfactory. The dancers are entertaining, after much debate my girlfriend and I agree that the Asian girl is the best dancer. The fun part for us is the people watching... never fails to bring the laughs."
3,Bartender was quite knowledgable and helped me get a terrific wine. Nice ambiance.  Nice relaxing place to chill and have a nice conversation.
2,"I have been going off and on to this place since i was a kid!\nI went last weekend and i think more than anything i just LOVE the place it's self. The food is hit or miss and they took eggplant off the menu and i do have to say that was my favorite thing to get there. But the building is so beautiful and inside is so many eye catching things to look at. and they have a trolley inside as well, so the kids would love that.\nThe service is AMAZING, i would give them a rating of 5 stars on that part, friendly, always around and quick.\nThe prices are not bad either, your meal comes with a drink, salad or soup and dinner and dessert all included. i pretty much never get the dessert their portions are big.\nThey do have a bar as well but it is not put to good use as i see it, it is in the back of the restaurant and they have never tried to make it a place to just go hang out and have drinks, too bad because it is pretty cool area.\nThere is rumor that the building is haunted and that they do have ghosts in there, so keep your eyes and ears open!!\nIt is just a warm beautiful place to go with friends, family or a date!!"
1,Half of my kalbi was cold and the solution to the problem was to order more and get I would get a little extra? No thank you. Portions are even smaller when ordered to go as well. What happened to this place?
0,"Gross, gross, gross.\n\nAll the tables were sticky and disgusting.  When I asked for napkins to clean the table (they were behind the counter), the male employee gave me ONE.  After I specified that the table was really dirty.  He really should have offered to wipe it down for me, but instead, I was handed a single napkin.  Incredible.\n\nThe food wasn't good.  My gyro meat was chewy and dry, like it had been left out or something.  I actually couldn't eat it.  My side was a Greek salad, which was (for the lack of a better term) soupy.  There was so much dressing that it made a mess of my plate and all the lettuce was soggy. \n\nIf you're nearby and want to have some (much better) Greek food, try The Great Greek."
3,This is a wonderful family owned restaurant with amazing service. Bagels are the best! Both the breakfast and lunch menus are extensive and the kitchen is very willing to make any dietary exceptions you have.
1,CLOSED - Sadly Cafe Krishna's service went down hill in the last few months and they have now closed.  Hopefully the replacement will be as good as Krishna was before the change in staff.
1,"Ordered the \""Carne Asada & Huevos\"" and I requested the eggs medium. I think that threw them for a loop. They forgot my salsa and sadly they never got around to bringing it. The carne asada was of good quality but was served lukewarm, which tells me it was sitting. Oh well I left full at least."
4,Cheap and fast service.  This is my 3 rd time renting with them and love it!
3,I've been here twice now and what a great addition to downtown! They've a variety of breakfasts items like chicken fried steak and chilaquiles along with a delicious bacon and egg sandwich with feta on ciabatta as well as your standard bacon and eggs. I've also had the roast beef sandwich and a nice salad with shrimp. The breakfast items are all great while the lunch items were good. That combined with a slightly high price point keep this from being 5 stars in my book but don't let that deter you. Check this place out!!!
2,"1 star for the excellent 1960s Wim Wenders film squalor and the hell-no-we're-not-being ironic ambiance.\n\n1 star for the cans of 1970s deodorant powder.\n\n1 star for the old and yellowed photos of old Vegas on the walls, and for the hokey mother's day cards in the card rack (also vintage, also just there because they still happened to be in stock). \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I luv non-ironic squalor just as much as the next former punk rock performance artist turned librarian, HOWEVER (imagine very prissy-ass voice here): your disregard for hoity-toity culinary standards IS NO EXCUSE FOR EGGS FRIED IN COTTONSEED OIL. Breakfast was eeeecccchhhh.  Phony o.j., putrid coffee (seriously, I think I drank the juice extracted from Wayne Newton's toupee, mixed withh the bile of a thousand disappointed stand-up comics). \n\nGo for the photo ops and the sweet cashier in the pharmacy section.  Don't stay for the food, whatever those counter-foodie communists from Lonely Planet tell you.  Everyone knows Lenin had miserable taste in food!"
4,Food is awesome and atmosphere is great! \nHad the staple Mac and Cheese it was creamy and delicious! 1000 island burger is incredible! Will definitely be back again and again!
3,"Stopped here on the way to the airport - just looking for a place with good food to run in and out of quickly. Dickey's complied to our needs.\n\nFor $7 they offer a double meat sandwich with two sides. I ordered pulled pork (one can order two different meats however). I was expecting a little more meat on a double meat sandwich - glad I didn't order a \""single meat\"" sandwich. The pork was quite good though as were the waffle fries and cole slaw sides. Free drink refills choice of 3 different sauces.\n\nGlad I stopped in here - I'll keep it in mind for future airport runs and whenever I'm looking for a decent BBQ sandwich in Las Vegas."
3,"Le Metropolis est la salle par excellence pour un bon show \u00e0 la fois intime et de moyen-grande envergure. J'ai eu l'honneur de voir plusieurs excellents bands rock, electro, des shows d'humour, un gala, un \u00e9v\u00e9nement de charit\u00e9, etc.\n\nEn fait il y a deux salles, Le Savoy (petite salle au 2e qui accueille les cocktails et les petits \u00e9v\u00e9nements) ainsi que la grande salle principale avec un parterre, des paliers a l'arri\u00e8re et une mezzanine. L'alcool est pas trop cher (si on compare aux stades & arenas), ils servent bi\u00e8re et cocktails. on voit assez bien m\u00eame lorsque les shows sont sold out et qu'on est pris au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, du haut de mon 5pi4. Heureusement que les paliers sont la pour nous donner quelques pouces de plus ! \n\nIl y a un vestiaire au sous-sol."
0,"It's a Sunday afternoon around 2 pm, so the fam decides to grab a burger and relax on the patio. Well, we relaxed alright...for 45 minutes waiting for our food to come (which never did). Apparently the computers went down and our order was lost. The waiter apologized, but we waited and waited while tables that came AFTER us were served. Our kids were hungry (and so were we), so we left with empty stomachs and a bad taste in our mouth.\n\nMy advice...don't bother."
3,"Great place!  Pretty slow, as you might expect on a Monday night.  Had nice Malbec, great marinaded olives and a perfect-sized sausage and mushroom pizza.  \n\nDecor is very spiffy.  Rather hard to find the place if you're not a local.  Little strip mall right behind the tire store.  Look Arden, as it's worth searching for.\n\nGet in here!!"
3,"A Geico customer hit our car and was responsible.  Geico sent us to Larry Miller in Glendale. (I really wanted to go to Moore in Glendale)    I was told by Geico to call and get an appointment time.  I was amazed at the fine  reception.  Upon arrival, a Geico man met me and checked the damage.  All of 10 minutes and one cup of comp coffee.  He sent me over to the on-site Enterprise and Geico, as promised, took care of my rental car (However, Enterprise was slow as hell in having the promised car available - couldn't even find the Geico request????).\nSo this is 4 stars for Geico and Miller!\nMy only complaint - the repair took 10 working days - most of which was waiting for parts.  My car was very driveable.  So why did I have to leave my own car and drive the very poor Enterprise Car?\nBTW, 2 stars for the Enterprise portion!"
4,It's a win when you see your best friend get a grown man's ass rubbed in her face. Then have her face shoved towards his crotch. \n\nI HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE. IT WAS TOO MUCH FUN!
4,I've been looking for a tasty macarons place as I'm new to the area. I loved that when my friend and I walked in all the staff was speaking French and the atmosphere was quaint and charming.\n\nI like that you have to ask the macaroon flavor which means their baked fresh daily. I ended up getting a sampler of all 6 flavors to take home. Pistachio is a constant favorite of mine. Although I was blown away by the black and yellow macaroon. I can't remember what exactly he said it's made of but I remember my taste buds were delightfully surprised. \n\nI'm definitely going to go back and have afternoon coffee here.
3,"This Oregano's location is always busy, so be prepared for a wait of 30-60 minutes.\n\nI've been here 7 or 8 times for dinner over the past year. The food is always delicious, and the portions are enormous. If you're looking for good pasta/pizza at a reasonable price, this is the place to go. The Bollo Pasta and Alfredo the Dark are two of my favorites. If you want pizza, go with the Deep Dish -- very rich and flavorful.\n\nI'll be visiting this location many more times during the upcoming year."
3,"Its a must do once....................tighten your pants, bring a second pair for the oppps when doing there rides(Check photos out) .........Buffet is good and I win there in the casino, 3 card, slots."
3,"My friend and I came here for because we needed to cure our hangovers...lol. The Pho here is pretty good, I can't complain. The eggs rolls were even better!!! if you check in, you get 2 free egg rolls!! Anyways, the bowls are pretty big. We could not finished our noodle soup. I will definitely go back to this place next time i go to Vegas thats if I remember too."
0,"I'd never been to an Amir, didn't realize it was a chain.  The servers were really confused (I'm hoping it was because they hadn't used the patio in a while).  It too FOREVER for the food to come.  The only plus - the potatoes, they were yummy (and I don't even like potatoes).  Go for the patio, not for the service.  One guy near us got smart, and went through the take out section and served himself.  He got his food faster and saved on the tip!"
0,"= = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  :-O  = = = = =\n\nOk, the old Hotel San Carlos here is serving a weekday lunch buffet, so of course I stopped in to try it.  Today was Mexican food day, & they had a small setup of 16 items, which might be ok as long as the food is good.\n\nI started with some of what they said was Tortilla Soup, in a styrofoam bowl.  Next, there was a bit of salad, & then it was on to the refried beans, which were cold, tasteless, & the consistency of the clay we had back in grade school.  They also featured nearly tasteless chimichangas, enchiladas, & tacos.\n\nOver at my table there was a pitcher of WARM water to drink!\n\nThe service was awful, & so was most of the food.  Factoring in price ($7.99), it was worse than Taco Bite!     :-O"
4,"Awesome east coast style deli food with a fresh and healthy update, this is the best, we go there all the time"
3,Love this place..
0,"Over-priced, bad service, and nasty food.  We went to dinner before the Pitt home opener (at Heinz Field).....Tilted Kilt would have been a better idea, seriously.  At least, Tilted Kilt doesn't bill/promote itself as something it is not.  Look - If we walk out w/ a $125 bill (2 people and no alcohol), it really needs to be spot on.  The steak wasn't memorable in any capacity (not even in presentation) and I am not convinced that the Chilean sea bass was really even fish.  Our waiter was an embarrassment to the service industry - he had less than four tables and was acting like he was in crisis the entire time.  The manager stopped by......but there was so much wrong, it wasn't worth discussing.  If you're looking for a good steak or just a fine-dining experience, try Capital Grille or Morton's (both downtown).   Or go to a real restaurant in a real casino.  I can honestly say I wouldn't eat here again, even if it were free.  It was simply a bad dining experience on every level.  I hate the casino, anyway.....this is just another reason I won't go ;-)"
2,"This place used to be better but unfortunately- it's going down hill. The food is bland. The chicken in their salads especially. I used to like it, but now I have no reason to go back."
4,Best burritos I've ever tasted from NV to AZ! Seriously can't find anywhere comparable
3,"Nice non-gaming resort just south of the strip.  The rooms are full one bedroom units and perfect for a family.  The beds have just been replaced and the new ones are absolutely wonderful.  The pool is huge and perfect for families.\n\nIf you don't want to fight the strip and seeking comfort that doesn't bust your wallet, this is the place to go."
2,"Went here with my husband and two small children on a Sunday afternoon.  The decor was pretty nice, even if the energy felt low in there.  There were a few families in there with kids.\n\nOur waitress was nice and attentive, but she didn't know much about the menu at ALL.  We asked her abotu the bottomless brunch which allows you to try small portions of several different things.  She brought out the menu then, but I felt she should have mentioned it to us as an option without me having to ask about it.\n\nWe ordered the tandoori wings for the kids (our kids luuurve wings) and two bottomless brunches for ourselves.  Hubby liked the wings, but I thought they were meh.  They had kind of a sweet stickiness on the skin which was a definite departure from traditional dry spiced tandoori wings.  I did go here understanding this is not \""authentic\"" Indian food, but the sweetness wings were a little too much for me.  \n\nFor appetizers my husband had the paratha, which was okay.  I had the lentil cake tower, which was delicious, and by far the yummiest thing I had there.  The sauces and relishes used for garnish had more flavor than anything else I ate there that day.\n\nBetween my husband and me we tried the shrimp and chicken tikka masala (passable), the shrimp curry (decent), and the shrimp korma (almost sickeningly sweet).  They do use nice, big, delicious shrimp, which is a plus.  But their sauces leave a lot to be desired.  \n\nI am giving three stars instead of two because my husband really liked it, it was kid-friendly (at least in the afternoon), the brunch was a good deal, and it was clean.  But the food did not impress."
0,"I don't know what's happening here. This is one of those places that you read all the glowing reviews, you go try it yourself, and you think you must have gone to the wrong place. \n\nUpon sitting down, the waitress came over and waited at our table for us to decide on a dish, little weird but ok. I chose the Kung Pao Shrimp and my friend chose the Yunnan Style Dried Beef. What came out was shrimp in a pile of oil and my friends dish was even worse. It tasted like beef jerky from a 7-11, and it resembled Shit on a Shingle. $11.99 for each dish and PLUS they charge you for rice $3 extra. I didn't think my shrimp was spicy at all. My friend couldn't finish her plate is was so salty. Then the waitress comes back around with our bill and stands there until we pay. This situation was bizarre. Too many other places in Chinatown to ever give this place a second try."
0,"if you're looking for a nice night out, keep looking..."
3,"croissants were perfect,  delicious sandwiches,  really sparse menu,  had the Cuban and wife had the cajun chicken. great location,  hip,  quirky,  very pleasant service."
3,"the arizona burger gets the extra star here- it's wonderfully spicy. other than that, it seems like big specialty burgers that are good but not great"
1,"Disappointed.  Farhers Day dinner service was slow (the bartender served us despite wait staff on floor, the guy did his best, but eh).  The prices are Scottsdale high. But all 5 of us were unimpressed with food quality and flavor. Ahi sashimi was delicate and tasty, thus the 2nd star.  Sushi was meager for the price.   Too many good sushi/teppanyaki restaurants out there to be wasting your time here."
3,"How to describe the Longhorn....It is Vegas's version of the neighborhood dive bar. small, crowded, smoky (but it isn't), but for some reason it's comfortable...The really reason for coming here is the food, seriously, I have been eating here for 20 plus years and have yet to have a bad meal, the ribs are good, the specials can be great, though understand, you're paying $9 for steak and lobster, you will never get prime steak and you will never get a large lobster tail for that price, a reality check is needed by some.\n\nAnyways, the food is good, the drinks are cheap, the gambling is low limit and they do offer live entertainment.\n\nGive it a shot, just walk in thinking that you are about to visit that redneck cousin at his trailer park in Kansas (His name is probably Eddy) and you will leave happy...\n\nThough here the burgers have beef in them, not ketchup."
1,"The food is Burger King food. I don't have high expectations regarding quality. I do however expect that customer service will be at least up to par with other fat food joints. \n\nThis morning, i pulled in to grab a quick sandwich before a long day of meetings. After the car in front of me got done ordering, i pulled up to the menu, and was greeted in the normal fashion. Provided my order and got a \""thank you\"". No total. No instructions to pull forward. So I pulled forward. Then the wait started....3 minutes......5 minutes....*shuts off engine*.....7 minutes before the person in front of me was presented with their order.....then more waiting, as the car and the girl in the window carry on a conversation lasting approximately 2 minutes.\n\nWhen I finally got to the window. The employee asks \""What did you want on that again?\"". I was a little taken back and said \""So, my order has not been put in yet?\"". She snapped at me in a very matter-of-fact tone \""NO\"".  Had she seemed even remotely understanding i would have just placed my order at the window. Instead I placed my money back into my pocket and began to pull away. At which point I received a very sarcastic \""Byeeeeee\"".\n\nFor the Owners/Manager/Operators: There is very little that distinguishes your food from the other fast-food joints. I don't go because it's better. I go because it's convenient to where I am at any given time. I will, however, give my business to locations that provide stellar customer service. If you aren't communicating the need for customer service to your employees, you are failing. If your employees are not providing at LEAST a minimum of proper customer service, then they are failing you, and your bottom line. \n\nI won't be going back to this location any longer for food, drinks, or the occasional shake anymore."
3,One of my favorite restaurants!  Love the Enchantment Platter. The Habenero burger is the hotest hamburger I have ever eaten.  Its awesome but beware!!!!
2,"Well first of all the $14 dollar admission fee is ridiculous...but what's more ridiculous is the $14 admission fee plus $3 dollars extra if you want to go in a maze.....\n\nWell since it's my bf's bday and there really isn't much to do in AZ, I decided what the heck and went for the $17 fee...just to kill time before dinner at POSH. So it has 4 levels....the first level was about building houses, and the human body...i admit some of the interactive displays were kinda cool but some where kinda boring. the second level consist of science on electricity, weigh, magnets, and light. The only thing i thought was cool was the nail bed. The third level was where the maze was and also where you learn about clouds, grand canyon and environmental sciences. The maze was a rip off really...don't understand why they charged $3 for the entrance...it was filled with optical illusion posters that I've already seen before online....so yeah really not worth the extra $3 bucks. -_-\""\n\nwe didn't get to see the 4th level unfortunately because we needed to leave before our two hour meter runs out...oh yeah parking is like $12 bucks in the garage....so yeah just park on the street if you can. \n\nSo $17 dollars i killed an hour and half at most. This place is really meant for kids....children....under 12...because I even think any kid above 12 would find this place a little boring. I can't believe they even have a membership program...who would want to come here more than once?"
1,"Today was my first time trying it, it wasn't too bad but I've had better.\nThe service wasn't good at all, he messed up one of our orders and not once did he check on my table. \n\nFood was decent, service could of been better. Maybe it was just an off day for them. Overall decent place if your on the go and need a quick fix."
0,"Terrible service. We went there for my 11 year old son, who wanted to celebrate after a school concert with a nice warm cup of clam chowder, which this place used to deliver on point.  Went in to a very empty Claim Jumper. Seems to have been like this the last view visits which should tell me this place is going down faster than the titanic. For the sake of not going on to long which I could about this place, I'll keep it to the point. DO NOT GO IN AFTER 6 PM IF AT ALL ANYMORE.  The service was terrible and they took forever with the food. The food that arrived was old and cold. Some had been left out and under the lamp so long the plates were to hot to even move in front of our 3 young children. The smoked meat looked like brown rubber strips, manager said that he was sorry and yes it is inedible. They brought out wrong orders as well. My wife didn't get to eat either, by the time they brought out her plate, after giving her a completely wrong order, it comes out 20 minutes later after serving everyone else. So that's two out of five that did not eat. This place is best to be avoided. Completely bad. The manager that took 50% off the bill (after also charging me for food that we never received or ate) was very unatentive otherwise. Waitress said it took so long because there was no other help. Manager said \""no we are fully staffed\"". Why at 7 pm at night does it take 45 minutes to get a cup of chowder then? In an empty restaurant !? Why were the plates so damn hot?  Because you people do not care !  We live around the corner from this place and was a monthly regular. The new staff is terrible. I will no longer go to Claim Jumper. AT ALL. Neither will the 5 people that were with me or the people I will reach via word of mouth and social media. It was that bad, all the way around. From service to management this place is just on auto pilot and going to crash. Let me know when it does and I'll try again. Until then, wake me when it's a new restaurant that deserves to be on the corner of Charleston and Fort Apache. They do not deserve to rep that corner or our neighborhood.   I'm in the bizz and also an Owner. I hope the owner see's this. I know I check our yelp reviews. Contact me via email. I will tell you exactly the issues. If I owned this place after working so hard to make it what it is with that beautiful smoker and exterior scenery.  I would be completely disgusted by the evening staff. They dropped more than the ball. At a $150.00 bill a month from what was our regular visits. This place just lost at least $1800 dollars from me annually not to mention the five other adults and children that could have gone here for years to come like we did, but also the people that will see this here and other venues. Best to find somewhere else for now folks. Avoid the hassle."
1,"Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress \nGreat mac n cheese appetizer\nTuna tacos were overly salty and inedible\nSalmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting \nVery overrated restaurant\nSpend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff"
0,"Earlier today my friend & I ate here. She seemed to enjoy her meal. Mine tasted fine. \n\nUnfortunately I got in my car leaving Applebee's parking lot feeling extremely ill. I had to restrain from vomiting the entire ride home (this was my first meal of the day). I have been sick ever since I ate there.  Do not order the bruschetta salad. In fact, just do not go there. Period. Your stomach may thank you.  I called Applebee's to let them know, and the manager was very stoic and said an insurance company would contact me shortly. That's it. No apology. Nothing other than, 'what's your name and when did you come here?\""\n\nSo in summary, I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."
2,"On my weekend visit to Pittsburgh, I quickly learned that Primanti Bros. was a must try.  My first taste was at PNC Park where they have an express version, but I must have had 10 to 20 people tell me that I must also try the original location in the Strip District to get the full experience.  So...at about 2am after a night of bar hopping, I wandered down through the warehouses and found myself in a packed restaurant.  I'd tried the roast beef & cheese at the ballpark and decided to try something different at this location.  I was disappointed when told that there was no more tuna, so I settled on the ham, egg & cheese.  Loaded with slaw and onions, I scarfed this monster sandwich down with ease.  Like the one at the ballpark, I found it to be good, but not great.  For me, the slaw is a bit overpowering and the soft bread makes it a huge mess to eat.  I'd order one again someday, but probably go with the black angus steak & cheese.  According to my last taxi driver, he claims that it's the best."
1,"I've been going to Cafe Rio for over 15 years. Since moving to Arizona from Cali we were pretty excited to be close to the  one on Baseline which is about 15-20 min from where we live but that made no difference because we loved Cafe Rio in the past. That location was average, always out of ice and always trying to rush you through the line. The food pretty good which kept us going back.\nWhen the San Tan location opened we were pretty excited because of its proximity. In the last year we've probably been 10-15 times to Baseline and this location 4 times. The other night we went and they were super chinsy on the meat we ordered 5 meals and each meal hardly had meat. Feels like Cafe Rio has gone down hill since franchising which is to be expected, but the prices continue to get higher. Get your act together Cafe Rio."
4,"Great service every time. Always seem to have what we need. Today I took in 5 watches. Normally I go to another place for watch batteries that might be a little cheaper, but lately I was having trouble getting there before closing time. This place is open til 8pm on weekdays and 7pm on Saturdays!  Even 10-5pm on Sundays!!  This is great news."
3,Flamingo upgraded rooms are pretty nice.. The location is perfect since it's in the middle of the strip. The casino is just okay. Not alot of great restaurants or attractions in the hotel but once again being in the middle of the strip it's easy to get somewhere for a good dinner or show. The price is best your going to get on the strip unless you stay at somewhere like the quad.
1,"Made reservation a day in advance; they didn't have our table, only option was to sit outside.  Are you kidding me?  Anyway, took the table;  service was extremely slow.  Took them a while for the server to come take the order.  Bread was served after repeated requests; sides were served COLD, when asked, they were served reheated not fresh.  PRICEY by any standard, it's not New York.. \nTheir lucky day, my wife and daughter loved their food and Tiramisu - 2 stars.  Yay!!!!"
3,I think for the price of the rooms it is a great place it is very clean and the costumer service is great. Wish the buffet lines weren't so long though!
0,Crappy service.
0,"My girlfriend and I came in here for brunch and were sorely dissatisfied. I had some pancakes, bacon and eggs. While those were okay, I could have gotten the same thing for the same value at Denny's for $5 cheaper. However, my girlfriend's meal was another story.\n\nShe had the 1/2 sandwich, soup and salad combo. I'll start with the salad, because that was the best part. The salad was decent; I'm not sure how you can mess up a bowl of mixed greens. The avocado ranch was a nice touch as well. Neither of us are sure why they served saltines with the salad and oyster crackers with the soup, but sure, why not.\n\nThe soup was a \""Yankee Potroast\"" soup. My girlfriend coined it as \""minestrone with one quarter-sized piece of meat\"", and that it had obviously been microwaved. Not a huge deal, but I think we all prefer food from an establishment that isn't microwaved and serves meat when it's advertised in the name.\n\nFinally, the 1/2 sandwich was a corned beef sandwich on ciabatta bread. The ciabatta bread was hard as a rock, probably old. When it was deemed inedible, I suggested that she just take the sandwich apart and eat the beef and greens. The beef was so wet that when my girlfriend carefully took the sandwich apart, it splattered onto her wallet. Ew. Altogether, her meal at $7.29 of microwaved soup, mediocre salad, and an unappetizing sandwich was not worth the price.\n\nI'll note one more thing here. With my pancakes I had poached eggs, and thank goodness I did, because I saw one of the servers shoving scrambled eggs into a bucket. I'm not sure when these scrambled eggs were cooked; it was likely in the morning for easy access when someone ordered them to pull out of the bucket, heat up, and serve. However, I'm not sure why they can't just cook scrambled eggs to order. That makes no sense to me.\n\nAll in all, it was a disappointing experience. I'm hoping that this was just an anomalous branch in an otherwise reputable chain and that they can fix some of these problems."
3,"Look this is simple. The name of the place is \""Roadhouse\"" as in peanuts in a bucket on the table, throw your shells on the floor, young waiters and waitresses dancing, and STEAK!   If you want a great steak or great chicken at a very reasonable price in a simple laid back ROADHOUSE style establishment then this is great.  This is not fine dining.  Sorry no special separate booths or perfect fitting baby seats or quiet whisper dining w a waiter that is wearing a white apron.  Give me a break.  Simple..... you want great steak at low prices in a simple place then this isn't a bad choice.....you want to cry about booths and baby slings and loud kids, ummm stay home."
4,Bloody mary's were great food was awesome.  Dave and Roxanne ate great people.
0,"I visited Jaycee Dog Park recently -- never again.\n\nIt's a tiny park, not much bigger than the backyards in the area. It was very nicely shaded, with a building on the west side, and many trees. Staying out of the sun here is not a problem, nor is finding a seat on one of its many benches. It also has a double gate, and plenty of parking close to the entrance. The city also supplies poop bags...\n\n...but apparently no one has ever used one. When I had five dogs, my backyard didn't accumulate this much poop in a month. It's disgusting, and a health hazard. Who are the people who don't clean up after their dogs?\n\nOther issues: The grass is excessively long in the areas where it grows. It looks like a weed garden in some sections. The ground is covered with trash, mainly of the bottles/cigarettes kind, along with candy wrappers.\n\nBeware, small dog owners. There is a gap large enough for a 15-20 lb. dog to pass between the gate and the fence on each of the two gates in the entrance. It would not be difficult for them to escape to the main park."
1,"On the spectrum of burgers, these are definitely pretty good. It's way better than a McDonald's or Burger King. However, I Love Burgers wouldn't want you to compare their experience to fast food, so I won't, either.\n\nWhen comparing I Love Burgers to other gourmet burger joints, it falls short.\n\nLet's start with the service. There was a small wait to get a table, even though there were tons of open seats. Granted, it was busy, but since the wait time for the actual food was around 45 minutes, wouldn't it have made sense to let us sit? Furthermore, even though we ordered fries, the waiter didn't even think to bring those out first -- we had to ask him. A simple thing like this would've made the time go by a lot easier.\n\nOnto the food... like I said, the burgers are decent, but nothing special. I had the \""i love bacon burger,\"" which comes with a patty made up of sirloin and applewood-smoked bacon, toped with crispy bacon, bacon mayo, gouda, and onion strings. Given how ravished I was at this point, I was happy to eat it, but I don't think I'll ever need to try this place again."
0,"WILL NEVER come back here considering there are a couple of other better Vietnamese restaurants around the area. \n\nI ordered to go and got:\nBeef wrapped in betel leaf appetizer\nVermicelli with grilled pork\n\nSo I went to go pick it up and asked for an extra anchovy sauce that should come with the beef wraps. I've had this from other places and it usually comes with anchovy sauce AND on their menu it states \""served with anchovy sauce\"". The employee (super nice btw) had no idea what I was talking about and said she would go and ask. Another employee came and asked me to elaborate. He then went back in the kitchen then came out and told me they were preparing it. I stood there a couple mins and the first employee came back and said let me check on it for you. Then I heard a voice from the back saying, \""no there's no anchovy sauce. We don't have anchovy sauce. There's nothing. I don't know.\"" So I figured okay they don't have it, whatever it's fine. But then the second employee walks out and hands me a container of some sauce. I ask if that's really anchovy sauce and he says yes. Really? You're going to lie to me? At that point I just grabbed my food and left. \n\nReason for 1 stars:\n1. Don't lie to me. If you don't have it then just tell me that. Don't try to give me something else and try to pull a fast one on me. What if I was allergic to something in that sauce? Not cool\n2. Vermicelli was decent. BEEF WRAPS WERE NOT EVEN COOKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH. They pretty much gave me raw meat. The only part that was cooked was the outside. Completely pink on the inside. That is definitely not how it should be served. I was so disgusted. That's a health hazard. If you can't make a dish right then TAKE IT OFF OF YOUR MENU!!! It's that simple. \n\nI would give this place ZERO stars if I could. I'll pass on this place. Definitely not my go-to Vietnamese restaurant."
1,"I know everyone raves about this place and maybe it was just our server but I did not have a good experience here. We waited about 7 minutes for our server to show up. No greeting and no smile. We ordered drinks and she brought then in a couple minutes - that was fine - but my wife wasn't ready to order. \""Just give me another minute,\"" says my wife. Well the sever took about 6 minutes to get back with us. Meanwhile the server for the neighboring tables had been back and forth four times.  Anyway we ordered and it was busy so we were patient. But meanwhile while waiting for our food another couple were seated near us being served by the other waitress. They got drinks, ordered and got their food 10 minutes before we did."
0,"Run don't walk AWAY from Dollar Rent A Car in Treasure Island! Starting with an hour wait to get service  ( with only three people in line) to them not knowing exactly which floor of the parking garage the car was on to the deceitful billing practices this company is shameful! \n\nTheir trick was to charge your for more than you had stated you wanted, then you look at a tiny screen(after waiting for an hour and on the verge of being late for a meeting) and hit agree. What we thought we were agreeing to was $150 but the billed totaled over $300 for 27 hours!\n\nWe had the same experience with the \""Free\"" GPS offer as another reviewer, which is not free at all.\n\nWe called customer service and tried to explain that we had not wanted all the add on coverage we were charged for and that we were told we would not be charged for a second day but just for three extra hours, but that was not what they billed for. They just stated that we had hit the \""I agree\"" button.\n\nWhat a horrible experience! I suppose they make their stock holder happy by robbing their customers but is that the kind of business that you want to support? Shame on you Dollar Rent A Car."
1,It seems like every time visit this location they never seems to have what I need. Also some plants don't look so healthy. I go to the other location which is far. sigh
1,"I went to Gus's once and haven't been back. There was loud electronic music playing the whole time, so it was really hard to talk. I had the sloppy joe, which was good, but overpriced seeing that no side came with it. Just a really weird experience."
0,Just another place trying to make money just off the name.. Let's just say.. I would not go back to this location... After eating at the one in LA... I don't even know how they can even call themselves Pinks... They should just call themselves - Just another hot dog place.   Very disappointed and I got a stomach ache after eating a chili dog...
4,"So happy I found these guys, Ac went out while it was 115 outside, 97 degrees in the house! I called 10 other places with \""24 hour  emergency service\"" not one would come out. I called Caleb at 5:00pm he showed up at 5:30pm the same day and had us up and running by 6:30! I will be using these guys for all my future Ac needs!"
3,"Clean and cute.   Oh yeah and good food.  Service is pretty good, a little slow when they get busy, which is a lot because it's not very big.  They have wooden menus!!!"
2,"Take this review as you wish...being that, at 24 years old, my first trip to Vegas was in August of this year, and this is the only Vegas hotel I've stayed in.\n\nBestie and I packed up the car Friday night and took off! We arrived @ \""TI\"" around 11 and the check in line was brief, despite the anticipated nightmare long lines mentioned here and on other travel websites. By booking online, for 3 nights we stayed in an upgraded strip view room for around $250. Our room was so cute! The beds were ridiculously comfortable, and everything was super clean. A few cosmetic touch ups may be necessary, but I guess I'm not so nit-picky. The TV was nice, we liked being able to plug in our ipods, and the wireless internet did what we needed to. Room - 4 Stars.\n\nOn our 2nd night there, after a day of binge drinking and a nap we decided to take it easy and hang in our own casino, did some gambling and around 2am went to the Coffee House and were SO DISAPPOINTED! The menu was so ridiculously limited that we almost just walked out. There are probably less than 10 items on the menu, including any dessert items...So limited that not even FRENCH FRIES are on the menu, yet $16 burgers exists. The food was pretty bland...however the French Onion soup was amazing, thank god. On another negative note, our server was SUCH AN ASSHOLE! Then when the manager came to check on us, the server was there and did something very nice, we both said @ the same time \""Oh NOW he's nice??\"" and the manager pretended not to hear us. Any drink refill, condiment request, check request, change request, was attended to with a delay and dirty looks. Prices are the same in the Coffee House as the ROOM SERVICE, so skip the moody server and eat in your comfy bed. Coffee Shop - 1 Star\n\nOn our 2nd day there we lounged by the pool all day, and the DJ was awesome. At first we attempted ordering drinks from the outdoor servers but they were so slow we started trekking in and out of Kahunaville for our drinks. While the drinks were good, they were severely over priced, even when you're armed with their \""coupons\"" which barely made a dent in a round of drinks for 4, and half the time to coupons were good for what we wanted. A round of 2 mixed drinks and 2 beers will run you $40. Pool/Kahunaville - 2 Stars\n\nOverall our stay was decent but the NOW $30 a day resort fee, rules, regulations, and restrictions were kind of a bummer. Don't offer \""coupons\"" or \""offers\"" if you have no intention of allowing your customers to use them on anything of worth. Oh, and the buffett is overpriced and just like any standard buffet food. \n\nJust a tip: When drinking poolside for 8 hours straight, don't abandoned your best friend/roommate, and then you REALLY don't want to latch the top lock and proceed to fall into a drunken coma till 1 am. She wont be pleased. Rookie move."
2,"One of the more organized thrift stores I've been to. The accessories wall (yes, a whole wall of purses/belts/scarves/jewelry/etc.) is worth a trip. As far as prices... most thrift stores have higher quality items at higher prices, the rest at lower sticker prices; however, here most items in the same category are the same price. This makes some things seem over priced. They donate to Safe Nest though, so it's all good."
3,"Inexpensive compared to other lunch options in the area. Cafeteria style service. You grab a tray and tell them what you want. They pass your plate to the next station. Then wait in line to pay. \n\nThe don't skimp on servings. I was going to pass on the cornbread and glad I didn't. It was absolute fire! (That means it was delicious) The baked chicken was tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes and gravy right on point. Dirty rice was good too. \n\nI will be back here when I'm hankering for a carb overdose. Don't go there starved, unless you can care less about overeating or spending a few more dollars for extra sides. \n\nGreat place to have lunch with friends. Open and spacious but seating limited during the lunch rush. Outside seating is an option too. Just know that it's crazy during lunch but they manage it well. Very friendly staff to boot.\n\nEnjoy!"
0,"Worst food, and worst service.  Will never go back to Red Robin.  Do not waste your time and money.  It is horrible."
0,"AWFUL. I used to go here as an undergrad and recently paid them a visit. I was going to Krannert for a play and was running a bit late for a full fledge sit down restaurant, and I thought Basil Thai would be a fair compromise given their proximity and relatively quick serve. I ordered their Massaman Curry and it was just plain awful. The rice was cooked too long and was on it way to becoming congee. The curry itself was tasteless, way too salty, and over spiced to the point of being bitter. The pork was over cooked. I took about two bites and tossed the entire thing. Complete waste of like $9."
2,"I had purchased the 20 dollars of food for 10 buck deal, they no longer honor the coupon, so need to communicate with Yelp to get a refund.,..  Good news is that yelp has already e mailed me about this, so keeping my fingers crossed that this is no hassle.  The restaurant in the o'aces bar is still open, and they still offer some of the same stuff such as the mad max burger.   I had the Kalifornication sandwich, was pretty good, but can get that anywhere.  I will just pick a place that has no secondhand smoke and loud drunks"
4,"The best Urgent Care I've been to. It wasn't busy, I waited no more than 30 minutes tops after filling out my (SUPER EASY) paperwork. The service was quick, I didn't feel rushed, and it felt like the entire staff genuinely cared about making me feel better. I walked in with a 103.8 degree fever and body aches, left with a perfect 98.6 degree temperature and antibiotics to cure my strep throat! The generous doctor even waived my strep throat test fee! Definitely going back there if I have an emergency like this again. :)"
0,"Went two days in a row to be sure it was really as bad as it is.  Shrimp scampi is a good example, chopped spaghetti with  a dozen popcorn shrimp stirred in, small portion served cool, high priced for warmed over \""stuff\"""
2,"I always pass this boutique on the way to work, so I decided to stop by one day.\n\nI noticed that my bras were getting too small and I remembered the golden rule on the show \""What not to wear\"" Make sure \""The girls are where they're supposed to be\""...\n\nWhen I first walked into the store I wasn't that impressed, It just seemed like an old store from the 70's w/ ill-fitted discounted lingerie on special.  It wasn't until I asked the lady in the back if I could get fitted, and then she started pulling out the good stuff...\n\nAfter I was fitted I tried on the correct bra size and ahhh, the world IS a better place when the \""girls\"" are where they belong!"
4,"Come for the Dim Sum.  Arrived 11am and it was fairly busy.  Full of Asian families taking their time and enjoying themselves.\n\nAmbience - Clean, well lit and noisy like most Dim Sum places.  Open kitchen which is somewhat unusual and a good thing.\n\nPrice - Ordered 1 A item and 4 B items plus 2 Tsin Dao beers ($7) for a total lunch of $22.38.\n\nService - Funny start when they tried to make me take a menu (I'm only part asian so I guess they wanted to make me order ala carte food).  After that it was good.  The hostess seated me right away and the food carts rotate quickly and consistently.  I hardly finished each plate and it was whisked away.  Busboy offered me a second beverage before I had to ask anyone for another.\n\nFood - Excellent selection sorted by food types: baked and fried goods, steamed goods, large sides (like fried rice), dessert and fresh beverage.\n\nPork Shui Mai - Good flavor but slightly chewy (like a typical chicken texture).\n\nBBQ Pork Bun Baked (Char Sui Bao) - Perfect bun texture and flavor with a tasty glaze coating (your hands will get sticky).  Stuffing of bbq pork was tasty.\n\nPork Dumpling (gau style not pot sticker) - Must have! great crispy dough contrasts with lightly chewy stuffing.  Lightly sweet flavor is delicate and delicious.\n\nChar Sui Bao steamed - Great flavor but dough wasn't my favorite (stick to the baked ones).\n\nShrimp dumpling (Har Gau) - Good sized value with sticky wrapper and delicately spiced shrimp filling.  Each one must have at least two 10-12 shrimps in it.\n\nDidn't try the fried rice, dessert cart or the fresh juice cart (soup or beverage?).  They also paraded around an asparagus plate that looked and smelled wonderful but I was too full.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the quality and value of this place and would recommend it.  I'm picky about Dim Sum and this place does a decent job on everything I tried and better than average with the Baked BBQ Pork Bun and Ha Gau."
1,"I go to the College of Southern Nevada just right across the street, so naturally, I had to go try this place out. What attracted me was that because I'm a CSN student, I'm given the chance at a discount when I show my student ID. So, awesome right? Good food and at a good price. At least, so I expected.\n\nI've gone to this Denny's a handful of times with a different set of friends, so I know that something has definitely been going down.\n\nJust earlier today was my last visit. I went with a good friend of mine after getting out of class. The lady in the back simply said, \""Good evening, please take a seat anywhere on the right side.\"" Of course, while a group of four who were probably students too were sitting in a booth on the far left. Hm, not a big deal, I guess; it wasn't busy after all.\n\nSo, we both take a seat. She hands us our menus and asks us first what we want to drink. Ten minutes later, she comes back with glasses and she takes our order, as we politely tell her thank you, and says that she'll \""have it out soon.\"" So we sit back and talk. And talk. And, talk some more. Note: We had both gotten in at about approximately 6:15 PM. At 6:40, my friend and I begin to wonder what had been taking our food so long, as he loudly sipped on an empty glass of water with no waitress to refill it.\n\nAt around 6:50, she comes back and gives us our food. Imagine how cold my Smothered Cheese Fries felt when I ate it, and to my dismay, how ridiculously small the portion was for five dollars. My friend got the Biscuits and Gravy. Keep in mind, these are two very simplistic dishes; not much to add in, so why did it take so long? I wouldn't know how fast the chef cooked it, but oh, we could only guess that this waitress took centuries to get it to our table.\n\nNot to mention, my friend was promised another glass of ice water. As soon as we finish eating, there's been no sight of her walking anywhere near or past us. We practically had to march our way over to the front area just to get the bill because we could only bet that he would've been late to his class if we didn't do it.\n\nThe previous time that I came here before tonight, the lady who gave us our check was practically harassing us with some kind of an attempt at a guilt-trip by going, \""I see you didn't leave a tip. Was our service bad?\"" Oh man, I bit my tongue. You didn't know how badly I wanted to say it, too.\n\nAnother time that I had, we didn't have utensils on our table for forty minutes. Our food had come in ten minutes prior. And, not to mention, I had to stop eating just because my refill didn't come in for what felt like hours.\n\nStill not convinced that this place is run by a nut job? My friend who I went with today overheard the waitress whispering under her breath about how \""crowded\"" it was. This location is a very spacious building, but believe me, and I kid you not, there were only four other groups of people in tables aside from my friend and myself. Clearly, this woman has never seen a true lunch rush like I have, and many others.\n\nBut anywho, you want to know the moral of this story? Unless you're such a die-hard for Denny's that you don't care when you get it as long as if you get it, then save some time and DON'T go to this location. You'll wait for hours and be treated horribly as a customer, if even as a person at all.\n\nIf I didn't enjoy Denny's food so much, I would've seriously given this place a star. Maybe even zero. Never again."
4,"A new Japanese / sushi place off Ft. Apache near Trop.\nA nice, quite and very spacious place, with great friendly staff. \n\nHad the Saba Shio Yaki dinner plate. Plus, I added the prawn and vegetable tempura for $4 extra.\nI also tried a spicy yellowtail roll...\n\nAmazing!! \n\n\n\nWill be back."
4,"I loved this Meet the Maker event! It was such a pleasure meeting Bill, Karen & Robin. Their passion for chocolate was clear from the moment we walked in to the event. The chocolate samples were decadent and the cookie decorating was a fun touch. This little Charlotte gem is here to stay! Can't wait to head back for another piece of the cardamom bark... YUM!"
2,Ok. Flavors were good. Like there Greek  Black Cherry. Staff was somewhat friendly. Where helpful put short answered. Some dispenser worked nicely put some where hard to get the yogurt out and others flowed way to fast and got all over hand when taking samples. Were out of a lot fruit. Which I load up on. The dry items they had refrigerated which caused them to stick and clump together. Will be back  thou after they been open for awhile. Really want to try their Maple Bacon Donut(nonfat) they have listed on website.
2,"Went Friday to take advantage of the special lechon (roasted pig).    \nI found the cafe cozy- nice, dark wood furniture and dark wood blinds.  Definitely more welcoming than the restaurants in Chandler!  I found the high counter a little daunting- I, being only 5 feet tall, had to either hoist myself up on the counter with my elbows to peer down, or had to crouch down to have a look under the counter, and have a look through the sneeze-guard.  Their labeling system needs improvement: I vote for adhesive labels that go on the sneeze-guard so that patrons can easily identify the food on the buffet line.  I'm sorry, but no matter how often Karey and Purine say they like to cook the food to order, food laid out in huge trays and placed in \""turo-turo\"" style ISN'T food cooked-to-order!\n\nHere is a list of the food I tried that day:\n\n1. Lechon, large order $6.99- includes corn tortilla (I subbed flour) and  choice of Spanish or Filipino garlic rice.  (I chose Filipino, of course!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg#SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg\n\n2. 3-entree combo of Dinuguan (\""chocolate stew\""), Beef Mechado, and Pork Adobo $- includes garlic rice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ#Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ\n\n3. Lumpia shanghai (fried Filipino pork eggrolls)- small order includes 8 pcs. of pork- and onion-filled mini-eggrolls that are fried.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ#HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ\n\n4. Halo-halo $4.50- frozen dessert consisting of sweet beans, coconut strings, coco jellies, ube (taro-based pudding), coconut milk, choice of ice cream, and shaved ice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA#cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA\n\n5. Pan of cassava $8- Cassava is a root, much like a sweet potato or yam that is pounded or ground into flour and then mixed with cream, butter, eggyolks, and sugar and baked/steamed into a cake-like dessert dish.  Somewhat cakey and much thicker than an egg-custard pie... A little help here, Joel?  \n\n6.  To-go containers of Pork adobo and Dinuguan, each $3\n\nI found all the entrees and eggrolls, save the mechado (meat was a little tough), very tender and very tasty (loved the dinuguan!).  However, they're ALL very greasy, unfortunately!  I'll never ever order the fried eggrolls again... Everytime I ate them, they came back to haunt me, and all due to the high grease and salt content.  A coworker came for her first visit (with her husband and stepdaughter. as well) after I had left, and told me that she found the eggrolls VERY salty, as well as the other dishes she tried there, but couldn't bring herself to tell the owners because they were all so very friendly and sweet.  Karen, Rey, and Purine, as well as Michael, were all very friendly and accomodating, this is true.\n\nI would order the dinuguan and pork adobo again, but I won't eat any of it until I'm able to place them in the fridge so that their sauces may gel up and I can skim off the HUGE amount of fat, reheat, and then place them back into the fridge again so that I may re-skim the fat one more time.  Only then would I be able to enjoy these dishes.  They are very tasty, but I have to be careful...  Or I could enjoy them fresh, but without much of the sauce.\n\nWhat my coworker and I definitely agreed on was that we'd both come back just to have the halo-halo again!  This dessert, similar to the Vietnamese Che ba mau, tasted like it was made from fresh ingredients, instead of from a bottled mix of beans, coco strings and jello.  I liked the ice cream they used, too.  You have your choice of either ube, vanilla, or mango.  I'll definitely have to come back and try a bowl of the two Filipino flavors...  As a special, Karen had prepared ginataan, a warm dessert consisting of plantains, jackfruit, coco strings, taro, and something akin to yams, cooked in coconut milk and sugar.  This looked and smelled so very good, but I couldn't try it due to food allergies.  I wonder if Joel had a sample?  I know he enjoyed the cassava... I did, likewise.\n\nAs for the lechon, I'm sad to report that the skin wasn't crispy at all, and I detected a chemical flavor every time I tried the skin.  It tasted much like what a disinfectant might taste like.  A faint hint, but still there, nonetheless.  The pork meat didn't wow me, either.  A big part of the enjoyment of lechon is the Mang Tomas Lechon sauce, which you can buy at Lee Lee supermarket in Chandler (or at Mekong in Mesa).  Awesome sauce, just ask Joel!  I'll have to try the leftover lechon soon with the sauce (I stayed away from it bec. I wasn't sure of the ingredients at the time).\n\nI will definitely be back to try their daily specials.  I do hope that Karen and the others strive to lessen the grease content of their dishes..."
4,"After leaving Jos. A Banks across the parking lot where there were no coats in my size (54), I met with Stewart who happily showed me a nice selection in my size and with buy 1 get 1 free, they are tailoring both now.  Good job and great service."
0,"If you like mediocre food, slow service (like really, really slow), and indifferent food servers, then this is the place for you.  Oh, did I mention they are also way over-priced?"
3,What can I say??  This place is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Phoenix!   The outdoor patio is really cool and the service has always been spot on.  They even have coca-cola in the bottle!  I have never had a bad meal here and the rib eye steak tacos are awesome with the homemade pancake style tortillas!  You can not go wrong at Chelsea's Kitchen!
0,"Bland franchise with a terrible uni color scheme and brutal logo. Other than the one season Jake Delhomme did not play like the mediocre QB he is, that's it. I defy anyone outside of Carolina to name a player on the Panthers. Julius Peppers does not count as he just left.\n\nI do love one thing; Coach Fox likes to call the onside kick at the most unlikely times and they often work."
2,"Three stars for taste and unique style pizza. But for a quick lunch, fogettabout it. Slow......Come on guys, your customer base in the industrial area have to be in and out in 20 minutes to get back to work. Here is a clue....SLICES! And while you are at it, a \""slice and a drink\"" lunch special  please. Most pizza joints have this, right? I would enjoy your great pizza more often, if in a reasonably time and price......"
0,"We live close by and couldn't wait for this place to open! Our first and only time eating here was pretty disappointing. \nAlthough service was fast and the staff were friendly, the food was not very good at all! Meat was dry and bland, salsa was watery... Overall poor quality or just old food! \nToo bad because this place looks nice and clean but they just need new cooks and recipes??!"
4,Service guy came right out that same morning I called in. He was friendly and knowledgable. Had my TV repaired that same day. The other TV repair company had installed an incorrect lamp. Now my TV looks great.
1,"You most likely will not agree with us on this one but that's OK and I say that because of the Yelp Rating and the crowd I saw while dining here my Yelp is being based on two lunches .\n\nAs soon as we were seated we received a bowl of chip crumbs that were dripping with oil and a small dish of what I think was sweet and sour sauce the color was  red .\n\nNext came our cup of soup and we both picked Egg Drop the soup was actually very good and fresh and  that made me think our meals would be great !\n\nSoon our meals came and they were VERY LARGE and also came with egg rolls and fried wantons both were fried to a cigar color I didn't eat them and steamed white rice (the rice was good) But my meal called Amazing Chicken had this sauce on it that tasted like sweet and sour sauce mixed with wing sauce and I tried to eat it but after a few pieces I lost my appetite and it is a shame because the vegetables were fresh and nice , the chicken was tender juicy not spongy it was cooked nice but that sauce killed the dish for me .\n\nMy husband didn't care for the sauce that came on his lotus dish but I think he didn't care for the fried rice even more because he thought it was rice with basically just soy sauce . \n\nNobody checked on us .\n\nWhen the busboy noticed our pushed away plates he didn't even ask if I wanted to take it with me...guess he knew I didn't"
4,"The sad thing is the owner has all but given up on this restaurant. I loved the food and the people. The best workers jumped ship seeing that ship was going down. I almost always spent Sunday afternoon watching football and drinking and eating, they were closed today. (December 1st) Sad to see a nice place go under. I hope the owner (Mike) gets his sh*t together and makes it work. I was the Duke here, never was before. . Oh well."
1,"Perks: fun atmosphere and great views. Cute slide from second floor that kids and adults alike were smiling as they went down. Probably one of the best views of the Valley and big outdoor patio that is great for photos.\n\nCons: the food. Ugh. My burger was overcooked and the bun was hard. The fries were barely warm. My husband wanted a steak for his birthday which he described \""was okay once he reached the middle.\"" Vegetarian friend was served Mac and cheese with meat in it but server was very apologetic. Other friend said her beef ribs were pretty good, but, all in all, very overpriced for the quality of food. All that saves this place is the ambiance which, for some people, is enough. \n\nI personally, wouldn't return."
3,"Keep in mind this isn't AC or Vegas.  That said, rivers is pretty nice for what it is.  There are some drawbacks sure, but it does well.  It's laid out nice, has a good selection of table games and slots.  The card room is always has games and the tournament structure is pretty good.  They have lots of free giveaways and plenty of promotions to keep you coming back.  The food is good, the better being Andrews steakhouse and the buffet.   Protip - the champagne brunch is really good. \n\nThe cons?  To start, drinks on the playing floor should be free.  There's no hotel.  There's nothing really live or upbeat.  Friday and Saturday nights should have live bands, dancing, and be really uplifting.  It just doesn't happen here.  It's pretty much all about the gambling."
4,"2011 International CES was all about 3D TVs, Mirrorless cameras, and tablets!\n\nThis was my first time attending and I really enjoyed it. The conventional center was so crowded and map was necessary if you were looking for specific companies but other than that just walk throughout the show and you'll have a great time. Not as much FREE STUFF as I expected but I got a lot of tote bags, pens, and some thumb drives. Also, they were giving away FREE NEW MINI REESES (CUPLESS!) by the entrance of the Central Hall. \n\nDEFINITELY WILL TRY TO GO AGAIN NEXT YEAR!"
0,"If there was negative rating I would give them negative 10 for lack of politeness, and costumer service !!!!! I checked in and went to my room with all my luggage only to find out they gave me an occupied room!!!!! When I went back to the lobby... There was no apology or anything \""we can give you another room if you want\"" what the F*** you think???? I sure don't want to stay in a dirty room!!! So I told them I would just like to cancel my reservation and go somewhere we and they would not cancel my reservation and tell me I have to cancel my through hotel.com!!!! I expected them to say sorry for your inconvenience let me give you..... To make it up!!! The hallway smelled like wet mold!!!!! I strongly recommend you not to make your reservation  because they didn't deliver the service that was advertised."
2,"Decent food and the usual waitresses are busy but attentive.  The salads are good but be warned they usually take just as long, if not longer, than other food to come out to your table.  Chicken strips are good and I hear the wraps are excellent.\n\nOther than that everything else is good but not great.  The potato soup is very good but don't order it too often as it is the soup-of-the-day about 90% of the time.\n\nA decent option when you are tired of to-go food in the downtown area or want something besides a sandwich."
4,as a Portland metroer I fucking love this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
1,This place is not very good.  I like their sesame chicken about 30% of the time - very inconsistent!  Everything else I've tried are ok or nasty..  My coworker found a bit of a bug in the plastic wrapping they used to wrap the container.  Would not eat there..
4,"I love these fountains! I can sit there and watch them for hours.....They are beautiful and, even better, they are free! Can't beat it for sure."
0,"Let me start by saying the food was amazing! Best ribs I've had yet and really great baked beans. Nice environment with a great open strip view. I chose to give this a poor rating because of the servers attitude. The girl who brought our food out had MAJOR attitude problems. Our waitress also checked on us once only after we asked another employee of her where abouts. Leaving for home tomorrow, frequent Vegas quite often. More than likely will not return or suggest."
2,"Pretty good restaurant - we went there for a celebration dinner and had a good time.  However, they told us three times at the door that we needed a reservation and that \""apparently everyone had arrived to eat at the same time...\""  Yet I looked around and saw gray haired folks sitting at maybe 8 or so of the ~20 tables.  Uh, okay - I get that you're trying to convey trendiness, but it's a Wednesday night, there's no one here, and I just got asked for money by random street folks two times while walking to the door.  \n\nThe food was pretty good - not much of it and nothing to write home about.  My scallops and crab cake were tasty and properly cooked.  However, for the price and atmosphere, I'd love to have something in Pittsburgh more like Lola in Cleveland or other five stars with serious soul and love in the food.  For example, at Lola recently, we got recommendations for apps, wine, and desserts that would taste yummy with our food.  But none of the five different people who came to our table ever chatted with us about  other things we could eat, what we were eating, etc.  I did get a few pieces of info about the wine from the waiter, but he didn't seem particularly excited about us eating there (we were the only ones in the room under 40, and most patrons looked like sleepy rich old folks).\n\nCan't put my finger on it, but I just can't see myself raving about this restaurant to others.  I wouldn't strongly recommend it to my friends unless they or I have a client, new hire, or out-of-town visitor that really needs to be impressed.  That being said, make sure to valet if you want to impress - we were asked for money as soon as we exited the door and walked to our car."
4,"oh in-n-out...how you'll always be the best burger in any competition with whatever east coast patty slinging, fast food dishing, french fry frying competition you face.  i'd happy take a double-double animal style with a side of fries and possibly a milkshake from you than any five guys concoction i can think up or even any artery clogging creation that spike mendelsohn can put in front of me or even a giant plate sized behemoth i can find at ray's.\n\ni miss everything about you...the well oiled machine you have running.  i love that the entire operation is always in plain view to the customer...how you have a secret menu that only true lovers of in-n-out (and anyone who can search the internet) knows about...how all the employees have aprons with giant pins knotting it all together.\n\nmaybe it's just the fact that i don't get to indulge myself in the deliciousness of in-n-out anymore that my praise for thee has grown exponentially...but i don't care, i love you.\n\nmy in-n-out pangs rival if not surpass my 2 am pollo asada burrito pangs...and that's saying a lot about someone who has a pantheon of hunger pangs.  the in-n-out purist in me doesn't want to see you franchised out, but it would be nice if the family business decided to venture east and show these elitists what a real burger should taste like.  but until my next venture back the my roots on the western side of the country, double-double animal style with crisp fries and a vanilla shake, you will be in my dreams."
1,"So you have a fascination with steampunk? And you feel like having some bar food for dinner? Well then, it would be a huge mistake to come here. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nWe arrived to find an almost empty restaurant at 9 PM on a friday night - a telltale sign - but I was excited to check out this steampunk-themed restaurant that I long to visit. I noticed that the place has a few gear motifs here and there and a few really cool and exotic sculptures. Besides that, it was just an open space with tables and chairs. Already, I felt disappointed. \n\nBut the real disappointment came when our food arrived. There were four of us and we ordered the bacon wrapped bacon and egg, oxtail sticks, chicken pot pie nuggets, cheese charcuterie, mac n cheese and potato fries. Our whole party liked the oxtail and the bacon wrapped bacon n egg but we could not get over the fact that these mediocre items were costing us almost 5 times the costs if we were to get these items elsewhere. \n\nI don't feel right paying $9 for a bucket of fries that tasted exactly like fries at McDonalds. Or paying $14 for a tiny bowl of mediocre mac n cheese. \n\nIf only their drinks were better to make up for the terrible eating experience but that would be asking too much of the Rx Boiler Room, as I ordered the Some like it hot cocktail and was terribly disappointed at this drink as well. \n\nStay away, unless you just don't care about the price - or the food -  and just want to come in to look at the cool sculptures."
3,I first was introduced to this restaurant when living in Fort Worth Texas for a year. I loved this place! It's a Brazilian churrascaria  which really means it's a Brazilian cowboy barbecue. Sounds simple enough but it's better!!! \nThis is an all you can eat monster meat bonanza like nothing you have experienced before unless you've eaten here.\nIt's an all you can eat buffet but here's the twist... servers walk around with sword like skewers full of the best cuts of meat cooked to perfection. You have a little disk you flip over from red for no I'm good to green which is load me up with meat. This is the highlight of this wonderful place to eat. That isn't to take away from the salad bar which has many great items itself such as the prosciutto or the awesome cheeses. Did I also mention that yes they also have a full service bar that is spot on!
1,"Great looking place, the food was OK and the service was below borderline.\n\nWent in for their breakfast, seated quickly got our beverages (ice tea and coffee) came quickly as well.  The food was... OK, but my breakfast companions eggs which were order over medium came with runny whites, and the \""hot and ready biscuit\"" on their menu was like a brick.  \n\nI do not know if our server was just having a bad day, but she seemed rushed and primary concern was anything but waitressing.  She was non-existent after just dropping our plates off at the table and we could hear her talking with someone else about txt'ing schedule changes.  This conversation went on for 10 minutes at least, at no point did she come back to check on us or refill drinks.  \n\nWe waited another 15 minutes for our server to reappear and mentioned the rock hard biscuit, which she comp'd our drinks (a small carafe of coffee and a large ice tea which were $5!!!) on the ticket.\n\nI appreciate the customer service at the end but it was a little too late.  Food was nothing to be excited about, beverages over-priced and the staff inattentive, will not be going back."
2,i had alot of fun last time i went there thier lounge room with the dance floor was cool and the security at the casino were frendly i enjoyed myself.
1,"Our stay here was decent, but I don't think we would stay here again.  I was running the rock n roll half marathon so I was thrilled how closely the hotel was located in relation to the finish line, and that was the main draw.  \nWe took the airport shuttle and our driver told us the hotel does not have a designated drop off area for shuttles so we had to be dropped at Harrah's and walk our bags over to the hotel which was a pain.  There were also no real signs directing you from Harrah's.  \nWe knew there was still construction happening so we specifically asked to be in a room that wouldn't have construction views or noise.  Well, we were placed right outside the construction and there was a chute right outside our window that chunks of concrete and building debris were thrown down.  It woke us up at around 7:30-8 on Monday morning and was so loud we were startled out of bed thinking it was an earthquake or something.   \nThere still seemed like other things that weren't completely finished.  The toilet ran for hours after being flushed and there was no info book in our room to reference for check out times, etc.  \nThe location was nice, close to the promenade, Starbucks, monorail, etc.  That's the main advantage I would say."
4,"This is an absolutely stunningly gorgeous club, featuring an open air DJ and dance floor, with go go dancers,  in front of a huge 10 story waterfall and lake.  \n\nThe open air feature keeps it from getting stuffy, even though it gets packed in here.  \n\nThis club is made for bottle service, with tables everywhere, and not much seating otherwise.  Long lines at opening to get in, with $50 cover for men (ouch) and $20 for women (unless you buy bottle service).  Drinks start at $10 for domestic beers."
1,"They don't carry bagel chips anymore and everything in there is easy found in Hawaii.  If you're from the mainland and looking for treats from Hawaii, I'd recommend asking a friend to send it to you."
1,"They must have mistakenly put the chilled chicken for the grilled chicken salad into my sandwich and the fries were room temperature at best in one of the two meals! The good is that the service was friendly and I like the new options that stay up with the trend of hipster food offerings such as brioche buns and pretzel buns and also I like that there is an option for supposed \""fresh lemonade\"" as well as salad options."
0,Just spent 40 mins waiting after being told the wait was 20. They were taking other walk ins who I suppose hap appointments but who knows. This place needs adult supervision...won't be back.
1,"I came here for the book club yesterday, and I can't say that I will be back  any time soon.  The afternoon started off well, but ended in a general distaste for this place.\n\nWhen I first got there, there was hardly anyone at the resturant, and it seemed like we got loads of attention from our server.  She was always coming over to us to bug us to order something.  I honestly wasn't that hungry, but I felt like I should order something, since the waitress kept coming over.   I ordered the American hot dog plate, and got fries and my coke to go with it.  \n\nEventually every one else ordered, but one girls sliders order completely got ignored and never delivered.  When she mentioned something to the server, she seemed as surprised as we were.  It seems like after I food got delivered, that's when things went downhill.  For starters, the place got packed with people watching the USA/Canada hockey game, but I feel like maybe we got forgotten.  So much so, that I had to ask a manager to get our bill for us.  I also told him that we haven't seen or heard from our server in almost an hour.  then, when the bill DID finally come, we had to send it back to get split so we could all play our share.\n\nI know its a sports bar, but it really lacked in service.  I think our table really felt ignored after while, with no drink refills, and having to flag down servers to even get our bill.  I don't plan on returning, as I was neither impressed with the food nor the service."
2,My go to place has been slipping a little.  The last couple of times I've come the food is either over cooked or under cooked.  The brie & tenderloin toast was over cooked the last 2 times to where the toast was burnt and still served and the bacon on the bacon wrapped shrimp was on the raw side. \n\nThe service is still very good and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice.  They also have the best reverse happy hour which starts at 10 PM and I believe and goes til 1 AM.
3,"I love coming to BJ's for their special brews of beer! They always have something unique on tap to drink! Beer is a little more expensive then your typical bar, but you are paying for a microbrew.\n\nThere food isnt half bad either! They have a large selection of food to choose from - Pizza, Pasta, Sandwiches, etc. There is something for everyone here! \n\nIf your going on a Friday night or Saturday night do the call ahead reservation right before you leave the house. It will save you 15-30min of waiting in line for a table."
4,"My girlfriend and I wandered into the gallery inside the Forum Shops at Caesar's, and I instantly fell in love with his work - so much so, that I have actually gotten into photography myself. His work is so inspiring. It is amazing what he can do with a camera. As soon as I buy a house, I am definitely purchasing one of his works to hang.\n\nMy only complaint is that I have continually emailed from Peter's web site asking when they will be opening the New York City gallery, since I only live an hour away, and to this date all of my emails have gone unanswered - but that is not a reflection on his work, which is absolutely stunning."
0,"Terrible \""hostess\"" experience. Woman at the front had a terrible attitude as soon as I walked on. The store is basically empty and I've been waiting for 40mins when I was told my wait time would be 15mins.\n\nAdd On: \n\nThis is my fourth time coming back due to inventory and no fault of the stores. I'm continued to be so disappointed by the \""hostess\"". They really act like you're an inconvenience. Will probably be my last trip and just drive an hour and a half to go to my home store. Really disappointed. This is not the experience I'm accustomed to receiving from verizon."
3,"Solid Mexican food. Don't ask me about authentic, I'm not ethnically predisposed to be an authority of the food. Its good and like Mary J. Blige  said, thats \""all I need to get by......\""\nLengua (cow tongue) tacos.\nCarne Asada Fries.\nSpicy chicken nugget burrito.\n\nI saw a dude order a carne asada fries plate and a giant tortilla, then pour the entire plate onto the totilla to make a giant carne asada fries burrito, brilliant!!!!!"
2,"There's a lot to like about Essence:\n\nThe food here is really good.  Sometimes the portions are a bit small, but the taste is always there.  Same thing goes for their coffee, too, always fantastic and a great way to wake up... a little caffeine buzz balanced out with a breakfast bagel.  MMMM!  \n\nTheir macaroons are really fucking good, too.  I like the tiny ones.  I like miniature things, I dunno.  I like tiny chickens.  I like itty-bitty little cars.  If I could get away with it, I would shrink myself to be about 8 inches tall... but I read a Bukoswki story that made me change my mind.\n\nI don't come here as much as I'd like to because the place is always so over-crowded it's a pain in the ass.  That means they're doing well and I'm glad that they are, but sometimes I like to eat in peace.  Essence is always humming with thirty different conversations going on and clanking plates and clinking dishes.  It's not a very comfy place if you've been out drinking the night before.\n\nAs I said before, depending on what you order, the portions can be a bit small.  I'm fine with that, I think Americans, as a general rule, eat way more than they should and we've been spoiled by such large portions.  So I agree with the portion-sizes here, absolutely, but sometimes it can be a bit expensive if you want a breakfast sandwich.  It's a bit silly to spend close to $10 and get like this small-sized little guy with a single strip of ham.  The food always tastes really good, but it's still overpriced.\n\nThere's a lot to like and I'm glad that they're around and functioning and doing very well for themselves.  I have a few gripes, I guess.  I desperately want a fantastic breakfast place in Tempe but Essence is overpriced and too goddamn loud, Harlow's gives me diarrhea and... what's left?  IHOP?  Denny's?"
0,"I'm an avid shopper at Ulta. Every time I've come in here to look, etc. employees are rude and on top of me the entire time. The reason it deserves one star is because I was here before Christmas a few years ago with my mom (shopping for my daughter) and I had a police man usher me and two other women to the back of the store. They made us empty our pockets, purses, etc. and we're extremely rude to all of us. They accused us all of being in cahoots with each other and planning to shoplift... I'd never even seen the women before! I was shaken up and very upset. But still very polite to manager and said I understood she was just looking out for the store and she was unbelievably rude and brushed me aside instead apologizing greatly, as she should have. Little did she know I was probably going to spend 100$+ on Christmas gifts! Very unfortunate because two or three of the girls here are angels and amazing helpers."
3,"Great experience!!! I hadn't tried the Mesa location yet and I went in for a yummy bowl of pasta and left not only satisfied, but incredibly grateful for my wonderful bartender/server! If you make it into this location make sure you ask for Ashley! She is fun and spunky and fast on her feet. She knew all the regulars and her smile was contagious! Best experience at  Oregano's by far. I will be back for the Big Rig and Ashley."
3,"Perfect shop for unique, witty, and humorous cards, gorgeous stationery, beautiful paper goods, and various novelties and gifts. I appreciate the staff are always helpful and courteous. Parking can be a pain, but once you score a spot, you will be delighted to explore all the goodies in the store."
4,"Best Jewish deli and bakery in town. Awesome staff, amazing food and out of control baked goods. We try to go to Chompies' at least once a weekend for breakfast. My favorite is the All American with a Poinsettia (champaign and cranberry) to drink."
0,"The whole service was awful! We got seated and it took about 15 min to get our drinks ordered, then they had the dishwasher, chef, waiters and the manager all taking orders. When the food was delivered about 30 min later one of our orders was wrong and the other was burnt also the table next to us had the same issue. And in the end when we went to pay they didn't have change so they asked myself if I had change for a dollar and when I said no the poor waitress had to use her own tips to give out change to the customers! Never again will I go there"
2,"I stumbled into GB this summer when I was at a conference in Scottsdale. Didn't really feel like paying an arm and a leg for hotel resort food so I ventured off into the desert, on foot, to find some yummy food. \n\nI sat in the bar area since seating was at a premium in the restaurant. It was a Friday night. I ended up ordering a Margarita since it was national Tequila day. It was pretty good. For vegetarians there wasn't a lot of non-meaty foods to eat. I ended up ordering a bunch of different sides for my meal. The food was really tasty and didn't cost me too much. \n\nUnfortunately, the service wasn't great and it did take a long time get served. But then again, it was a busy Friday so I didn't really mind. If I'm ever in Scottsdale again, I'll probably do a little more researching to find a place that's a little more local and a little less of a chain."
2,"From St. Louis? Missing your IMO's Pizza? Then you need to go here for your Pizza fix!\n\nI recently had family visiting from St. Louis and was told we need to check out Frasher's. \n\nDecor/Atmosphere: If you've ever been to a Ma & Pop Steak House in WI then you'll feel right at home. It's a pretty dark and old with some huge circle booths surrounding the table. There is St. Louis memorabilia all over the walls. \n\nService: ehh - we probably had to wait about 15 minutes from when we placed our drink order to when we placed our food order. She was friendly and knowledgeable but would have loved to see her a little more often....\n\nFood: If you've never tried the St. Louis style pizza you really should! A thin crust pizza topped with the amazing Provel cheese and sausage. It's much higher priced then good ol' IMOs back in Missouri but I'll pay the price to get it out here in the valley. The toasted ravioli was among the best I have ever had. The loaded potato skins were loaded with pretty much loaded to the max - a little loaded for my taste with cheese, onions, bacon, black beans, and I'm sure a few other things that I'm forgetting (I'd personally prefer TGIFridays). I ordered the Provel Chicken Sandwich because it had provel in the name - meaning I should love it. I was pretty disappointed with the sandwich though. The fried chicken was a little tough to bite through but was moist on the inside but there was a severe lack of provel cheese from what I was envisioning. The complimentary bread served with some flavored butter is pretty awesome though!\n\nIf you're from St. Louis they have the book for you to sign and of course write down which high school you went to.\n\nSummary: Go for the pizza, bread, and toasted ravioli."
0,"I wouldn't eat here again if it was free!  The food was just okay at best.  But the minute you walk in, your feet stick to the floor.  The tables and counter tops are sticky.  It is just filthy in this place.  Do not recommend this under any circumstances."
1,here for happy hour on the patio 1st strike was the lipstick on my draft beer glass. 2nd was the the very rude server who treated our group like we came to dine and dash... the good points the chicken fundio and them accommodating my friends lap dog on their patio. good food bad service. yo Pancho stop being an ass no tip for you buddy.
1,"Always wanted to try. Not impressed. Their signature drink frozen hot drinks were somewhat a little disappointing. Too sweet, tasted like a slushy melted ice cream. We had the chicken and waffles for breakfast... Ummmm no!!! Chicken too dry, potato too dry and waffles just lack that umpf! Pricing was a little over priced for the food that you ca"
0,"You could not pay me to come back here.\n\nI'll start off with the pros: Marquee is able to lasso some renown DJ's (I came the night Redfoo of LMFAO fame was deejaying) and I liked the music in the main room and in the smaller hip hop area. There's a nice balcony/pool area, that is all the more enjoyable if you go during a warm evening.\n\nEverything else about this club is a nightmare.  If you are absolutely insistent on checking this place out, I have only one recommendation for you: GET A TABLE.  If you do not get one, you will have to deal with the following:\n\n1) Rude ass bouncers both outside AND inside the club!  Yes, I understand you've been standing for hours herding and hustling people (most of whom are probably not fun to deal with, drunk or sober), but be professional.  You chose this job.  Or maybe you didn't.  In which case, it might be time to get that GED.  \n\n2) Crowds and crowds of people.  Maybe you're into that sort of thing, but I like to go to the club to dance, not have to deal with drunk white girls pushing me and screaming at me when I literally did not touch them and getting elbowed in the face and kneed in the back of my legs.  If you do not have a table, you will constantly be herded by the bouncers to places with no space.  You are NOT allowed to stand in walkways or enter dance areas that are already at full capacity.  If you stop to rest, a bouncer will yell at you.  If you stop to take off your heels to rest your feet (due to climbing an endless flight of stairs, see point #4), a bouncer will yell at you.  \n\n3) Nuclear levels of douchebaggery.  Some guy named Cash who is an employee of this fine establishment helped our entire party get in without a cover.  Honestly, I was thankful to him and wanted to just tip him for his generosity.  But we didn't, and he ended up spouting some nonsense to us about how he'll get us a table and free drinks.  Well, these \""free drinks\"" ended up being $20 a pop and consisted of an 8 oz cup of club soda.  No alcohol.  My guess is Cash pocketed most of the cash and lived up to his name.  Uncool, dude.  No need for that type of play.  I would have rather he be upfront about things.  But that is exactly the type of BS that you'll have to deal with coming into a place like this. Naturally, Cash left to do his thang and the promise of free drinks and a table left with him.\n\n4) The stairs: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w?select=JvT5VYkd_3HHLnrljGKv7w.  Absolutely unacceptable.  Whoever designed this club needs to be fired.\n\nMaybe more alcohol would have helped me tolerate the Marquee experience but alas, I'll never find out.  I'd rather spend my precious time and money on XS or Tryst."
1,"If you want to be squished by hundreds of sweaty strangers with out even room to dance then come here. The restaurant is nice and I like the atmosphere the club has but Tao needs to seriously crowd control they let too many people in too fast, I was over it after 30 min. Not to mention the quality of people we ran into, maybe it was just random but this fat drunk Mexican literally feel on top of my girlfriend. My GF playfully smacked her ass when she got up. Apparently she didn't like that and started charging at my GF then tried to swing at her. Held back by all of her friends she finally stoped acting dumb and went away. I latter saw the same girl trying to dance on the stage where the bouncer kicked her off for being to raunchy. Thursday night might be better but I won't be going back. I've heard marquee and XS are much better clubs."
1,"Noisy. Crowded. Mediocre food.\n\nI also call their cleanliness into question. Upon attempting to use a mustard bottle at our patio table, a piece of dirt/napkin/dried-out-mustard had jammed the tip of the squeeze bottle. What I thought was just thick mustard exploded all over myself and my wife when whatever was clogging the end was forcibly ejected from squeezing it.\n\n+1 star because the waiter was kind enough to bring towels wet with soda-water for us to clean ourselves up."
0,"I dont even know why anyone likes this place. All their meats taste exactly the same, like nasty rubber salami.\n\nAnd there was a fly in my soup.\n\nEven their commercials fucking suck. Did they really think Spongemonkeys singing the most annoying song in the world would make people want to buy sandwiches...?\n\nI'm all set with Quiznos. Thanks, but no thanks."
2,"I had a pretty decent experience on my visit at the end of July. We arrived on Thursday prior to regular check in hours but were serviced immediately. I had a deluxe room which I ask the desk clerk if there were any Strip views available she more than happily accommodated at no charge. Although my room was far from the elevator the strip view was awesome.  When I arrived at my room I was please at the cleanliness.  The only down side of the room that I could pick out was there was not a refrigerator.  I mean really TI!!!!.  \n\nAnother downside of the hotel is the pool was on the small side compared to alot of the other hotels on the Strip.  The casino itself was ok  nothing to brag about.  I did not visit any of the restaurants based on the reviews that I read.\n\nThe staff I can say made my visit very pleasant.  The conceirge was very helpful when I needed assistance with places to go and the best way to get there.  The Bell Desk was very accomodating as well.\n\nOverall, I would stay again if I come across another good deal."
1,Enjoyed my veggie burger with fries. Service sucked the last 2 times. We had to flag down a waitress to get our refills. Next time we'll do take out to avoid tipping poor service
3,love the food
2,"This garage is hit or miss.\n\nCompletely depends on what is going on (events etc...) Pricing is usually fair but I have left several time feeling taken advantage of. ie. special event flats rates when you are not there for said event.\n\nOtherwise I usually feel safe leaving my car here, kept pretty clean, and within walking distance to just about anything. I'll be back!"
2,"Sometimes, you really want sushi but you just aren't revenous enough for AYCE.  Enter Kobe Sushi Bistro happy hour.  \n\nFirst of all, this place is huge.  It's thebiggest sushi joint I've ever seen.  The decor is very nice.  Pretty lanterns and pendant lights.  \n\nWe were seated, and a bit overwhelmed by the 4 menus to choose from: happy hour menu, AYCE menu, cocktail menu and roll menu.  \n\nWe decided on happy hour.  Beers and sake are buy 2 get 1 free, rolls (approx 45 to choose from) are 50% off, sushi is 30% off, and apps (tempura, teriyaki, potstickers, salads are 50% off. \n\nWe had 2 beers, hot sake, 4 rolls, potstickers and baked green mussels. Bill was $51. \n\nThe standout was the johnny roll.  Highly reccommended.\n\nKobe won't be my go to spot for AYCE but I would definitely return for happy hour again."
3,"My mouth was watering at the thought of tasting Thomas Keller's cuisine for weeks before I visited Vegas.  While it was tasty, I consider anything under 5 stars for Keller to be a disapointment.\n\nThe servers were friendly, helpful and accommodating, funny and personable without being overbearing.  They offered tastes of drinks and were happy to describe anything on the menu in vivid detail.  These were our dishes, and my thoughts.\n\n1.  Oysters:  These were from New Brunswick, and they were good.  I've had good oysters and bad ones, and these were among the best.  But that's to be expected.\n\n2.  Terrine de foie gras:  This was rich.  Very rich.  It was a struggle to finish, which is not how I've ever felt eating foie.  I also prefer a seared piece of liver, rather than the terrine.  It was a little salty.\n\n3.  Cheese plate:  We ate 6 cheeses, and 3 of them were fantastic.  The others were average for a restaurant of such caliber.  I'll give them this one.  It was a great selection.\n\nAppetizers were good.  If the meal had stopped here, I may have leaned toward five stars.\n\n4.  Steak Frites:  This was run of the mill.  The pommes frites were tasty, but the cut of steak was tougher and less flavorful than I had hoped.  I wouldn't recommend this entree.\n\n5.  Roasted chicken:  It was moist and well cooked, but seasoned too heavily.\n\n6.  Pan seared skate:  This was my first time trying this dish, and it may be the ingredients rather than the cooking, but I was thoroughly unimpressed.  It was tough, dry, and way too salty.  I don't usually leave dishes unfinished, but this was one.\n\n7.  Lamb:  This was the best item I ate that evening.  It was moist, flavorful and accompanied by a delicious sauce.  I'd recommend this to diners at Bouchon.\n\nAs I said earlier, it wasn't a bad meal.  I just had such high expectations, and I was let down.  It was not the best meal I had during my two-day visit to Las Vegas.  Not bad, but proceed with caution, especially for Keller fanatics."
2,"A-ok for now. When I went it was almost empty in the place so we were seated right away. The sever came and though I appreciate her being friendly towards my daughter and humoring the Tinker Bell talk, I was secretly wishing they would wrap it up already because I was super hungry haha. \n\nWe all ordered sandwiches, turkey club w/fries, crispy chicken w/onion strings and a kid's grilled cheese w/fries. I only tasted the turkey club and it was very good (can't really mess up a turkey club, at least I hope not). My daughter took only one bite if her grilled cheese but she never eats in general because of how picky she is. My dad said he liked the crispy chicken and he loved that it came out hot. \n\nThey only thing that made me wonder....we were literally one of the three small groups of people sitting in there. If the place were busy I would understand why our server was hardly to be seen. She checked on us once right after we got our food (of course when my mouth is full) and then we didn't see her again until she FINALLY came with the check. \n\nOne small thing to add...She never offered us a refill on our drinks, what if I was dehydrated..."
3,"name changed to \""Nate's Place\""\n\nhow do i explain this joint?\n\nit's been around for quite some time, and since moving nearby, jsut recently began coming up in the radar of nearby dive bars.\n\npros: i can ride my bike here. the new owner is cool. they do poker tournaments. they do karaoke. for a dive they have nice beers on tap, like harp, guiness, ace pear and kiltlifter. they have food (never tried it, though). \n\ncons: standard stuff that goes along with a dive bar, but that's kind of what makes it fun to go there. my favorite old bar fly is Einstein (so nicknamed by my former roommate for his wild, white hair); he speaks in these sort of half sentences all the time - you get either the first part or the tail end of any thought that happens into his head. he favors the ladies (shocking, i know), and although seems out of it, is surprisingly lucid at 1 a.m. for example, he was going on about a sort of conspiracy theory, and to placate him and being my usual sarcastic self, i commented \""ah, i see, it's all coming together now.\"" at which point, whithout missing a beat, he responded, \""i don't care if it all falls apart.\"" and launched right back into his half-sentence tale of the collusion de jour. well played, einstien. \n\nanyway, back to cons: it is waaaay too bright inside here for a bar of that caliber. and, the karaoke patrons tend to be the ones trying to take their serious shot at american idol - i heard more sappy pap country love songs and creed than i can handle. i guess i'm used to more upbeat or fun karaoke, not  this, \""i'm seriously belting a love song in a dive bar at midnight on the weekend\"" variety.\n\nit's got outside seating area with tables, but the view is terrible - kyrene road right at baseline in a kind-of strip mall. \n\nmore cons:  they only have a beer and wine license... that means no shots... or no shots made with any liquor that has over 12 percent alcohol content or something. weird, right? \n\nthe last three times i visited Nate's Place I left either immediately after or before finishing my first beer, and the last straw was a Thursday night when I took my beer on the patio to escape the way-too-loud  creed karaoke to find a very strange group of crack heads. I blatantly studied the dynamic of the group - they were loud and seemingly begging for and def enjoying the attention - and came to the conclusion that the mid to late 20's gentlemen fancied hisself a pimp; I swear to god he even rocked a cane. He dressed white trash meth-ghetto and had what appeared to be a strung out prostitute in tow. I haven't been back since."
3,"Was really pleased with the little hotel.  Great location directly across from Hard Rock, rooms were nice, staff was fantastic.  Pool was nice.  My only complaint is they didn't have a pack n play.  Granted they are not really a kid hotel.  We had a baby with us So we went and bought a pack n play for the night.  Really liked that they welcomed our dog.  Food and waitstaff was great."
0,"We ordered for take out, and this was the worst burger I've ever had! And to top it off, we ordered a chocolate shake and what we got was chocolate milk with crushed ice done in a blender!  The service was friendly."
4,"Stopped by here for lunch on a weekday. No reservations were required and we stepped right in to an open table.\n\nWe had the carpaccio and it was delicious. My friend also had the scallops, which were served in risotto. This was a very well made dish, texture and taste wise. I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes scallops and risotto. \n\nWe also ordered the truffle fries which were potato wedges with truffles as well as a flat bread. Both were good. The flat bred resembles a pizza and makes a good appetizer for a party of 3-4. \n\nOne of the best parts of Olives is the view of the Bellagio fountains. Sitting inside, the backdrop of this restaurant are the fountains. Probably very romantic at night. There's also balcony seating and I would love to try to get a table on the balcony next time, if it's not too hot. \n\nOverall, very recommended!"
1,I just moved over in this area and was trying out different salons. I needed a gel pedicure so i stopped here.  The salon was not as clean as you would liked and they got their tools from a toolbox. Nothing seems to be santized. When doing the pedicure they do not massage your feet. And the gels are so so.  I had a french tip painted on with the gels and I could of done a better job.\n\nWill go try another salon after that.
2,"Mediocre Chinese restaurant in Madison. Cliff and I came here for a cheat meal after a long cleanse. \n\nWe ordered the black pepper deep fried chicken, garlic eggplant, and a seafood soup. \n\nThe chicken was very disappointing; normally, chinese restaurants fry this chicken dish by the whole, but Fugu skimped out. They gave us the nasty little  parts of the chicken (including cartilage and god knows what else), heavily battered them, and fried them - so each bite consisted of crunchy dough and oil. A few pieces into the dish I started to question if they were even serving me actual chicken. \n\nThe seafood soup was a miss. It was heavily salted and tasted as if they dumped frozen seafood inside an msg loaded broth. \n\nThe eggplant was the only decent dish. I tasted sweet chili sauce more than anything else (didn't taste the garlic at all, so the name was misleading). Though it actually made me want to finish my rice. \n\nAside from everything else, I feel like Fugu needs to chill with the red chili peppers and hot chili oil. They drench that in every single goddamn dish that when you finish and look at the plate, you realize that half of it consisted of red peppers."
3,"My husband and I loved this place!  The atmosphere was a bit gaudy, yes but our waitress was cute as a button and extremely polite.  We came after Happy Hour, but she showed us menus for happy hour and told us about the blues/jazz and belly dancers for future.  \n\nWe ordered humms, large greek salad and shrimp souvlaki.  Honestly, everything was fantastic.  Our pita was warm.  Our waitress was very attentive.  We ordered 2 lemonades that came in long, super tall glasses. It seemed fresh squeezed.  We did go a little late, there were about 4 other tables outside and they had the fire pit going.  We wil be back."
1,Nice room and the bowling alley was cool.\n\nBig minus for the morning shuttle leaving earlier than scheduled and the front desk denying the fact. We were outside by 9AM but the shuttle was already gone. Be prepared to pay cab fare. \n\nJust DO NOT RELY ON THE HOTEL SHUTTLE SERVICE.
4,"Loved our time at this place although we had a hard time finding it after eating at the excellant Raku (we didn't realize it was in the same plaza!). The place is kind of set up like Chikalicious in New York where you can order a three course dessert and watch them building it in front of you if you are sitting at the bar. The suprise starts when after ordering, they ask you to eat the menu with some delicious sauce. Desserts were delicate and beautifully presented. Will have to return to try more items."
4,"Kitchin is an outstanding high end restaurant in Leith with well prepared regional dishes such as grouse, and local ingredients and cheeses, and an excellent wine list."
0,For $20 food I would rather go to Thai BBQ. The servings here are to small for the price.
0,"they have phantom charges on our bill for  the natural gas for the grills and they charges us for refilling the pool after they had it emptied, take forever on fixing things. now after i went in in december to put my notice in not sure when we were going to have a house they said don't worry you only have to give 30 days notice.. lie! they are going to charge us a full extra month 1500 for not giving proper notice."
2,"I was here a few months ago buying a cherry-red Monogram Vernis bag that I've been lusting after.  I'm not a big fan of the Monogram Canvas or Multicolore lines, but I do like the Vernis.  The \""Pomme d'Amour\"" color really pops on the patent leather!  It'll be a great four-season bag.\n\nAs for the store itself...oh, you know....it's an LV boutique in a mall.  That means it's smaller than a flagship, and it's crowded as hell.  Shopping here is not terribly special.  The woman who helped me was pleasant enough, but had limited command of the English language.  In all, it was a surreal experience."
2,"Our south tower room had great view of the Strip and casino isn't so large that you get lost. Room was a bit tired and there are newer, cheaper options. Not bad."
0,Staff was rude and pizza stunk!!!!
2,"Communication prior to wedding was really great; I knew what I wanted and expressed spec. styles, was reassured it could be done.\n\nMe, my mom & my mother-in-law had hair & makeup done by them.  \n\nThey were prompt.  Literally at 7:01 AM the doorbell rang.  I had makeup done by Celina & hair by Courtney.  I had my m/u done first.  I showed her various pictures of what I was looking for and didnt look like any of the sample pictures, nor did I like my look at all.  I didn't get a good look at myself because right after she finished, I went to the hair chair.  It was only until after that I noticed that:\na) my got tons of glue on my lower lashes\nb) my foundation was uneven\nc) my blush and eyeshadow weren't blended perfectly, so there were harsh lines\nspectacular.  \nd) some of my eyeliner was sparse and moving\n\nI did the airbrush foundation.  I didn't like it.  It looked like a lighter coverage that what I normally use and that's tinted moisturizer.  It didn't rub off on my clothes.\n\nMIT 702 makes strong claims about how they are the \""only\"" co. that does a lot of things, so I want to be clear on what they do provide.\n\nThey offer a touch up to go kit.  This kit consists of a sponge for face, an eyeshadow applicator and a free lipgloss.  I don't use powder regularly and she recommended I use powder to keep my face looking good for so many hours, so I had to get my cousin to make a quick trip to sephora.  \n\nRegarding the lipgloss, it wasn't a color I would have chosen, but literally she had a dozen tubes of this \""universally flattering\"" lipgloss that she gave to me, my mom & my mother-in-law.  My mom actually refused to wear it because she felt awkward having the same color as me & used her own lipstick instead.  The lipgloss definitely wasn't 15 hr proof, it was gone after I had my first glass of champagne in the limo & nonexistent in 90% of the pictures.\n\nAs for the lashes, I used my own because the ones they had were super long & looked too fake.  Re the lasting of the makeup, I was done at 10:15AM & got home just past midnight.  My eye makeup was still on, but had caked, my blush & foundation looked a bit sloppy.  I did have a long day, sweated, etc.\n\nMy mom hated her makeup.  She said that the one time I did her makeup looked a lot better than what they did.  I didn't think my mom looked any better than when she normally does her makeup (& she is hard of seeing).\n\nMy mother-in-law looked great.  Celina seemed hesitant to use lashes on her bc her natural lashes are so blond and she has light hair, but she was excited about them, so used them anyway.  She looked good.  She didn't look over the top or anything, a very natural look, which is similar to what she normally wears.  \n\nHair\nMy mom has thinning hair & I had e-mailed ahead to let them know this.  She usually uses a product to add fullness and forgot it in NY.  I also emailed ahead about this.  The stylist (Courtney) emailed me back telling me to check out Sally's for the product but we didn't have enough time.  She did was she could, but unfortunately the product she had was grey and my mom had light brown hair with dark low lights.  Considering the circumstances, her hair looked good & held up throughout the day & night.  She wanted to add some brown, but the makeup artist said the only way would be to break an eyeshadow and she didn't want to do that because she didn't think it was worth it.  She also said this after going on about how she buys all types of things and writes them off on her taxes.  It isn't how I would have acted in her position, but completely understand her stance, though she could have been more professional in her wording & demeanor.\n\nDespite telling me she couldn't do my hair in the fashion that Megan had told me was a go, she still did a good job.  My hair held well throughout the day and I was able to work it a little into what I wanted for the night.\n\nMy mother in law's hair was fantastic.  She has beautiful, thick, luxurious & plentiful hair, so admittedly was a great canvas to work with, but her hair was great & lasted the entire day.\n\nMy only commentary regarding the hair is that we all had the same colored bobby pins used on us and given to us for \""touch ups,\"" yet my mother in law has blond and red hair, my mother has light to medium brown hair and my hair is jet black.\n\nOverall, these girls were both on time, super chipper & friendly.  I would rate hair an A- and makeup a C, at best.  Another additional commentary is that Celina, the makeup artist was done before Courtney the stylist was done.  She collected the money & said she had a day full of bookings so had to be on the go.  This is why I wasn't able to point out issues with my makeup to her.  Courtney stayed about a good 30 mins after that.  I thought this was weird & unprofessional.  \n\nThey sent me emails to write reviews on wedding sites, when I did, the review was disputed, so beware of what may be a false positive in the rankings. Solid 2.5 here."
1,"You definitely get your money's worth..only $14. I in a hurry is say its worth it, but if you want a real massage and your nails to really get taken care of..I'd go somewhere else."
4,"Decor is superb - great take on 1950s milk bar with a few twists and a couple of nice tables outside.  Faces south with open outlook so would be good for an al fresco coffee. \nNot my favourite street in Edinburgh but good to have a great cafe like this on it.\nFlat white coffee served in a glass was superb and the chocolate brownie with whole hazelnuts was beyond perfection!\nHot food menu is intersting and is pretty cheap - portions seem big enough for lunch without being huge.\nService was very efficient which is the main thing, but quite distant.\nOne point - would have been good to have the door open, or a bit of ventilation as was quite airless.\n\n28/3/12 - went back again yesterday to recover after returning from an early start work trip to Glasgow (VERY handy for Haymarket and probably one of the few place in the area to get a decent italian style coffee ie not a bucket sized latte!) ... and sat outside in the sun looking with a view of a grey wheelie bin and Morrison Streets shabby environs - but still great to be back! As I think this place is so great I am upping the four stars from my initial review to 5."
0,HORRIBLE PLACE!!!! \n\ngot the filet mignon and lobster tail! the lobster tail was HORRIBLE it tasted like rubber way over cooked and too much sauce which gave a horrible nauseous feeling!!\n\nthe filet mignon was already had better at cheesecake factory.\n\nThe roasted chicken was over cooked and disgusting.\n\nthey messed up on the french fries that we had ordered on the side.... it was burnt!!!!!!!!!\n\nthe service was horrible.... we saw a waitress maybe once or twice... throughout the night before we were given the check. She never once came by to check on us and the food!!!!!\n\nour main server was the bus boy who got everything and was friendly enough to check on us... unlike the waitress.\n\n\nwe did make reservations and ended up being seated 30 min later as well..\n\n5 star restaurant? I THINK NOT!\n\n\nTHINK AGAIN BEFORE COMING HERE.\n\nour bill came out to 225.\n\nfor over cooked food...
0,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. From the moment we checked in, we were treated poorly by the staff - the woman working the front desk asked us to take a seat while she \""saw what she could do\"" about our reservation, even though we had successfully booked it prior to checking in and had the confirmation number in hand. What she actually did was check in every single person in line behind us, not bothering to address our reservation until we interrupted her and asked what was going on (a good 20 minutes later.) I'm not sure how us essentially losing our place in line translated as her \""seeing what she could do.\""\n\nBut it gets worse. We had a few friends visit our room, and apparently the security guards saw them through our window (creepy much?) They proceeded to bust into the room, kicking every person out and searching places as strange as beer bottles for \""anything they should know about.\""\n\nWe talked to the manager about this, who assured us that it was fine to have additional guests as long as they weren't spending the night. I'm not sure if the manager talked to the security guards about their behavior, but it was extremely inappropriate and uncalled for.\n\nIf you want to be treated like a teenager having a party in your parents' house or a felon, then stay here. Their rooms have a nice something-died-in-here scent to set the ambiance, too. Alexis Park should spend more time finding the cause of that smell than searching beer bottles for contraband."
0,"I have been to this jiffy lube before and the service here has always been great. However, after my most recent trip here, let's just say things weren't so great.  I parked my car behind the building where the line says 'SMOG LINE' and a manager approached me. He mentioned that the wait time was about an hour and a half. He asked me if I wanted to wait and I said yes. Then he started sweating and looked around nervously and suggested to me another business around the corner with much faster service even after I agreed to wait. I've never been basically told to kick rocks by a manager especially as a paying customer. I'm not too sure what drugs or drinks had been consumed but this was just crazy. I've never felt so embarrassed and stupid leaving a business before. Basically defeating my purpose of getting in the car in the first place. \n\n\nThis WAS my neighborhood car repair service center, but after this experience I will definitely look to yelp in finding a new care center for my vehicle!!"
0,"Was excited to try this place because it had great reviews. However, we were really unimpressed. First of all the waitresses argued over which one was actually going to wait on us, after we had already been waiting for quiet sometime. The waitress barely understood basic English. My husband ordered no beans with his meal and I got no beans with mine which I wanted. My husband said his chicken enchiladas tasted like chicken from a can. I wasn't impressed with my meal as well. We ordered fried ice cream for Desert and it wasn't good at all the ice cream was hard as a rock and couldn't even spoon it apart. Don't think we will be returning."
1,"I became a patient of Dr. Barrettoko after my favorite doctor at Nevada Family Care moved on.  What a disappointment that was. I would have followed her, but her new facility did not accept my insurance.  \n\nDr. Barrettoko is not of the same caliber as the previous doctor. The final straw was during my last appointment. As I was telling Dr. Barrettoko what I was feeling, what symptoms I was experiencing and I caught her texting on her cell phone.  She works with an iPad-like device that has the patient's medical records on it.  She was trying to hide her cell phone behind the tablet as she was texting away. Unbelievable!  If want a doc's I undivided attention do not visit Dr. Barrettoko.\n\nThe rest of the staff is nice enough. I do not have experience with any of the doctors at Nevada Family Care."
3,"This gym is MAJOR!!! When I entered Gold's Gym Elite I felt as if I was checking into a hip hotel like The W. Very modern, stylish and CLEAN!! I am beyond happy about joining! It is extremely clean, which a gym should be. The staff is friendly and helpful. The cardio machines are way cool. Each one has a personal tv to use and a cord to connect your i-POD. How cool is that? It doesn't have a pool which is a bit of a downer. The views from the gym are excellent. I did my cardio workout the other day and watched all of the planes flying into Sky Harbor. It was fantastic! Gold's Gym Elite in Phoenix is not overly crowded which makes working out there so much more enjoyable. I was a member for a long time to a very popular gym in this part of the valley. It was way too crowded, and the bathrooms were filthy. I gladly ended my membership and joined Gold's Gym Elite."
1,"i am revising my review of back east and embarrassed to be duchess of this place. i first loved this place because of their vanilla half and half. that was until one day, when coming near closing time, i realized it was fat free vanilla coffeemate! their service continues to go downhill- how many times to i need to get attitude from someone before i decide that einstein's is actually better?  last time we went, they were out of ice and soda, yet my friend was sold a cold cup with no argument. we have changed our weekly bagel brekkie to bagel nosh- i'd rather drive to awahtukee and have someone be happy i'm dining at their restaurant and have decent sandwiches-other than the veggie sandwich, back east fails miserably,imo. i hope someone that works here and/or management reads this and realizes that they pretty much just lost 3 of their best customers.."
3,"Sugar Factory had a great ambience, the server was really friendly, funny and invited us back for breakfast. My boys and I all had steaks before a night out, I had the filet mignon medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and to my delight was tender and flavorful. Definitely worth trying at least once."
4,"I went here last weekend & tried their Cecina A La Tampique\u00f1a. It's a thin seared seasoned sirloin with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms & bacon & Mexican cheese with chilies, onions & red enchilada sauce WITH a side of beans & rice, whew! I thought it'd be weird because of the bacon/cheese BUT OMG sooo good! The sirloin, though thin,  was very flavorful & the chilies gave it a kick! The rice was traditional Mexican rice & the beans pinto but they were seasoned well. It could be I LOVE me some Mexican food or it could be that my waitress was such a sweetheart but I will def be back next month for my bday. I hear they have a tequila club (hmmm lol) as well as karaoke on Saturday for those of us that are brave lol, whatever the case I'm a fan :-)"
0,Used to go there all the time and the last time I went the tech accidentally cut off a chunk of skin which was horribly painful and two days later I found out I had a massive staph infection
0,"My friends and I went here for dinner one night, and I wish we hadn't. We were hankering for some Tex-Mex type food, but this place, while it looked promising, was a major fail.\n\nWe were seated right away, but that was the only positive of the evening. We ordered chips and salsa. The salsa tasted alright, but the chips tasted like they were poured into our bowl from one of those $2 bags you find at the grocery store. Blah. The food we ordered was INCREDIBLY salty!! Salty to the point where it was nearly impossible to eat it! Everyone ended up only eating about half their entree as a result, and even that was a bit of a struggle.\n\nTwo in our group ordered mango margaritas, and both of them said they weren't very good at all. And then the waiter... He was MIA for most of the night, and I felt like taking our order, refilling our drinks and checking in on us was a bother for him. I don't need my waiter to be uber-friendly, but he/she SHOULD at least be attentive and a little personable. Bad food, bad service."
2,"Since there are no half-stars, I had to give it a 3-star as opposed a 4-star.  I feel that although it is better than Gap or A&F, it still is quite bland.  However, their saving grace is the fact that they show their Canadian pride with that emblazoned maple leaf (HAIL CANADA!!!!)!!.  The service is better than their product, and the employees got a great laugh when I told them thank you for keeping a great effort with my business (my last name if you do not know is Root)!!!!!!"
1,"Bucca Di Beppo is an Italian chain restaurant specializing in huge portions of mediocre food, with goofy, but likeable decorations thrown around inside.\n\nThere is a whole group of diners that believes quantity trumps quality and this chain is custom designed for them. Food is served family style; small orders usually feed 2+ average people and large up to 4. Many people feel you are getting a great value here, but personally I see lots of very CHEAP pasta being served and you are paying through the nose for it.\n\nThe pizza's are thin crust and rectangular and did not look very appetizing due to the toppings being slung on it haphazardly and one side was a little burnt, a frozen Frescheta is better than what we were served. The chicken carbonara is nothing like a regular Carbonara, it is served with Alfredo sauce instead the egg thickened cream sauce. \n\nI can go on and on, a lot of the entrees are pasta, red sauce and cheese, pretty common American Italian fare, nothing exciting. Now was the food inedible or bad - NO, but to be honest The Olive Garden which would get three stars if I ever choose to review it. Quite frankly Olive Garden, has better and more authentic (hard to believe but it's true) food.\n\nLike I said earlier I can see this as a popular place with a certain crowd of diners, it serves it purpose and will continue to be successful, to be absolutely honest, I wanted to like it more than I did. It was a fun atmosphere and I like the concept, but I would much rather pay $14 for an entr\u00e9e, finish it all and be wowed, than pay $16 for a mediocre pile of food and have mediocre leftovers for the next 2 days."
3,I was out on a date and she took me to Bliss REBAR. It was a Friday night and I wasn't really in the mood for a crowded bar scene. The ambience of the place is really nice. Not a party spot but people were definitely having a great time. I had their pomegranate martini and it was DELICIOUS. Not to strong but strong enough to taste it. It was smooth going down. The veggie mac and cheese was ok. I was told they have the best mac and cheese. I would have to disagree. They good mac and cheese... certainly not the best. I've had better. But it was good. The staff was friendly and the place was clean.
4,The burgers are good and so are the prices. But if you really want to experience The Works skip the restaurant and sit at the bar. Introduce yourself to whoever is sitting next to you and I *guarantee you'll you have an interesting conversation. Unless you're the one who's not interesting.\n\n\n\n*I can't really guarantee anything. Wtf.
4,"Oh how i love Town Square!  Its got a little bit of everything in one location :]  The restaurants are all amazing, the shopping is to die for, and Rave Motion Pictures is the best!  The ambiance is beautiful---the lighting, the park, and just the overall feel is wonderful.  It doesn't matter if you're looking for a place to have a romantic night out or to party with your friends...Town Square is definitely the place to do it!"
0,"If i could actually rate GLLounge negative 3 stars..i would.  The manager & lash technician should take a course in customer service.  I booked a appointment & arrived to be told i had no appointment...instead of acknowledging their mistake, we ended up going back & forth regarding the \""imaginary\"" appointment at 10am.\n\nalso there is a huge language gap as the manager speaks below average english.\ni will NOT be back nor would i recommend this lounge to anyone wanting to be treated like a VALUED CUSTOMER."
3,"My favorite pizza in Madison, WI.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA?select=jRGZL2b1hdZcoZszIcBQRw\n\nI could care less if the pizza is pre baked and that the crust is meh. Did you see what was on my pizza?! And yes, that is all it takes to wow me sometimes. \n\nSo glad I got to have that pizza again after a 5 year hiatus."
4,The husband and I have gone to Arrowhead Tan & Nails for the past 6 months to get pedicures. The staff is always friendly and they always do an amazing job! We would highly recommend them!
2,"I got the BBQ burger and it was good for the price. Nothing special. I wouldn't wait in a long line for it though. Love the crispy skinny fries but the ranch sucked. Lots of shakes to choose from.\n\nThis is also not a place to just sit, hang out & talk . When you see the line you kinda feel obligated to leave."
1,"This review is mainly about service, my wife and I stopped here after wrapping up at the dog park for dinner, Now we both have different tastes so we always split the pizza with different toppings. We were going to order a 3 topping pizza with half salami, onion and green pepper and the other half pepperoni, olive and mushroom. The person working told us it would be $1.50 for each additional topping which I was quite puzzled since we were only getting a 3 topping pizza then he explained that if we wanted different toppings on the other half it would be $1.50 each or $4.50. At this point we walked since I have never had a pizza place charge extra for splitting the pizza."
2,Not my favorite Cycle Gear store - the selection is not as great as the one on the Cave Creek but ultimately they had what I was looking for - so who am I to complain?!
4,"I usually wouldn't review a theatre, but I really need to brag about a manager (Aries). He is an amazing person that reminded me there's still people out there we can be thankful for this holiday season. My husband, daughter, and I drove from California to visit friends & family for Thanksgiving, but wanted to catch the \""Frozen\"" movie the day before (Wed). During our drive I called AMC Theatre's number and asked a nice lady if they still had the $5 special they use to have Mon-Thurs. She said yes except for holidays. I asked her if today counts as a holiday cause it's so close to Thanksgiving, she said no. It will still be $5/ticket. I was so happy ... Until I got to the theatre to purchase tickets. The young boy said it would be $29.90 for all of us. I was shocked cause I mentioned the $5 special I talked to a lady on the phone about just that morning. He suggested asking his manager, Aries. When the manager came out, he immediately apologized to us & handed us our tickets ... for FREE! My husband and I looked at each other shocked cause that's the last we expected. I wanted to hug him!!! \n\nThank you Aries for making our family night out a memorable one :)"
3,Large cake portions. Good selection of macaroons. But I thought the almond croissant was way too sweet. I love my sweets but that was just unbearably sweet and I couldn't even finish the small portion. The almond croissant from La Belle Terre was much much better.
1,"Well, I guess I'll be the first to give a not-so-great review. \n\nI so love Hubert Keller from all the cooking shows (and actually, I rode in an elevator at Mandalay with him- but couldn't get the nerve up to say anything! DOH!). I had high expectations, and felt so let down.\n\nWe sat at the bar, as the booths and tables were all full. The service was friendly. We ordered the strawberry mojitos to start. They were not good. They tasted like cherry 7-UP and the strawberries were so big they clogged the straw- so you couldn't get a sip without scooting your straw around and trying to dislodge the strawberry. \n\nWe ordered the mix of 3 fried things and 5 sauces to share, and I ordered the veggie burger. I found it a bit daunting to choose from all the little extras for the burger. I did try a couple, and, in the end, my veggie burger ended up costing around 15 bucks (with no fries...those we had to pay extra for).\n\nWe chose the mozz sticks, sweet potato fries, and regular french fries for our combo. For sauces, we chose the spicy ketchup, the tartar sauce, the cinnamon sauce, the chipotle aioli....and I can't remember the other one. They weren't horrible, but none of them were special. Again, it's Hubert Keller's restaurant, so I figured the sauces would be sublime. The fries were also so disappointing! Just basic, frozen fries. The sweet potato fries were great with the cinnamon sauce, and I usually don't care for sweet anything. They were the highlight.\n\nMy veggie burger sucked. For one, it was huge. Hotel rooms in Vegas typically don't have microwaves, so there is no way to reheat left-overs. I don't understand why Vegas restaurants serve such ridiculous portions when you cannot enjoy left-overs! More than half of my veggie burger was thrown away.\n\nThe burger was also mushy and tasteless. I ordered some of the cool sounding add-ons, but couldn't taste them at all. The beet relish came in a little ramekin and had no flavor whatsoever. \n\nMy sister and her friend liked their meat burgers, so maybe it's just the veggie burger. If I ever try the place again, I'll try the vegan sandwich (with the roasted veggies) on ciabatta."
3,"I have lived at Desert Club apartments now for four months and feel I've had enough time to give my opinion on the place... \n\nThe Good: Convenient location to everything in Scottsdale and highway access, gated community, the pool is never too busy and great for relaxing with nice chairs, very quiet community and I hear no noise inside my apartment (top floor though), feels safe, nicer finishes in kitchen with the tile floor and granite counter tops, quick maintenance response times, ample visitor parking in rear of complex, nice gym, staff is usually friendly and helpful. Unique floor plans with lots of cabinet space in the A2 floor plan. \n\nThe Bad: Single entrance into complex can be annoying, grassy area's in between buildings smell like urine from all the pets, pool could use a cleaning more often (leaves and debris at the bottom) and there is constantly yellow caution tape around the hot tub (not sure what's that about), almost non-existent resident functions, efficiency of the AC in my 3rd story unit seems poor (the AC is always running), glass block window in A2 floor plan lets in a lot of heat (my apartment faces East and West), breezeways and stairs are sometimes littered and are dirty with accidents from pets. The kitchen has a spray/stream faucet which comes in handy a lot but there is no option to add a water filter. The water here isn't too great so I've had to resort to buying bottled water.\n\nTips: Before moving in, make sure you get the code to the entrance gate if you are moving in early in the morning or on a weekend. We didn't have the gate code for the moving company and it caused a bit of nightmare. Also, for efficiency sake, I'd request a North or South facing apartment.  \n\nSummary: I looked at a LOT of places in Scottsdale for an apartment before settling at Desert Club and I would probably do it all over again if I had to. The minor items on the bad list, though there are several, aren't enough to outweigh the good of the place for me so I generally enjoy living here.  I almost chose Barossa across the street but opted for Desert Club because of the larger pool and the additional square footage in the one bedroom."
3,"Great New Age Burger Joint. It's a Bar, Meets a wide range of burger options, from turkey to Grass fed. Not your typical burger place and well priced for quality.  The Salted Carmel  shake was the best I've had, so good show old chap.  Lol enjoy."
0,"Customer service is of utmost importance if you are running a restaurant. This place has none.\n\nWent on 11/6 with a friend to this restaurant. My friend said she had had the food here and recommended it. Before you walk in, you get attitude from the bouncer. He stared at my ID like it was fake, even flipped it around to check the back in a way that indicated that he didn't think it was real (I'm 24 and don't look underage). Also, ignored my friends request to just see her ID in the wallet.\n\nWe sit in the back patio area and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally I go to the bar and ask the bartender if there's a server that's supposed to come around or if we are supposed to order at the bar. \n\nBartender: \""Did someone sit you down back there?\""\n\nMe: \""No we just sat down back there\""\n\nBartender: \""Oh yeah, if you weren't seated then no server is going to come to you. We don't have servers just walking around\""\n\nMe: \""Can you please send someone out there for us?\""\n\nBartender: \""Sure\""\n\nAnd you know how this ends. No one ever showed up. Plus, walking out, there's a sign that says, \""Please seat yourself.\"" So why the bartender thought anyone would sit us down is beyond me. I'm sure the food there is probably okay, but I'll never know.\n\nI won't be going here again, the service is just terrible. I can only imagine how awful it would have been if someone ACTUALLY had taken time to taken our order."
1,"Like a lot of other DTLV casinos, the Four Queens is small, old, and wreaks of smoke.  Nothing really at the 4 Queens that gets me going here.  However, I still have friends and family that love this place only because they've won her before.  If you see me here or check in here, it's usually because I'm here with out of towners.  \n\nFairly loose slots based on people I know.  Table games are okay with minimal limits. The bars are packed, but nothing worth bragging about.  \n\nI don't frequent the 4 Queens like I did back in the mid-90's.  But will stop by because I tend to use them for their parking."
3,"I was visiting a client down the street and found this on my Yelp App. Located in a odd spot and smaller I was greeting by Phrank the owner who is from Redlands CA. Phrank took the took the time taking orders personally and even came out to the dinning area and made sure everyone was happy! Now that's service. \n\nAfter placing my order with Phrank at the counter my food arrived within minutes is seemed like. I saw good reviews for the fish tacos and went with the fish taco combo plate. Tacos were yummy, sizable pieces of deep fried fish with cabbage and a light white sauce. I added some salsa which gave my tacos a nice kick. The beans and rice were also good. \n\nPhat Phank's has been here two years and it's nice to see a non big box place chain do well. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the tacos and burritos - prices are reasonable and service is great."
4,"Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious, Mexican + seafood, where could things go wrong."
4,"In-N-Out has never let me down, whether I've had it in LA or  AZ. I'm especially fond of this location because it's never that busy when I go and the service is, as always, fast and friendly. I usually get a double double, animal fries and a Neapolitan shake. I've yet to attempt a crazy secret menu order, but I have a feeling they would be more than happy to fullfil it here."
1,"Keine Ahnung mehr, wann ich mir einen Account bei gmx.de eingerichtet hatte, das muss wohl auch vor 2000 gewesen sein. Was mich aber dann dazu bewogen hat, zu web.de abzuwandern, war die regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Aufforderung, seine Interessen anzugeben. Warum sollte ich das tun? Das hat mich genervt.\n\n\n Inzwischen gibt es wenigstens 1 GB Speicherplatz. Das haben andere Provider nicht, immerhin.\n\n\n Die Adresse gibt es immer noch, ich nutze sie nur eigentlich so gut wie gar nicht, weil ich inzwischen f\u00fcr meine privaten Mails eine andere Adresse nutze, mit der ich ganz zufrieden bin."
2,"This is a solid place for those seeking Hawaiian food since it's not a very common type of food found in this area that I have seen.  I tend to favor the Chicken katsu which is served with boiled cabbage, steamed white rice, and macaroni salad.  \n\nOther items on the menu to take note of would be the Moco Loco and Spam Moco which are also common foods amongst the locals in Hawaii.  If you seek a quick place for some Hawaiian type comfort food this restaurant is pretty good.  With generous portions and plenty of seating, my friend and I tend to go here when we're looking to have a late lunch on the weekends."
4,"I've ordered every way you can (take out, pick up, dine in, delivery) and every way has been great. They seem to always quote the right time and in fact when I pick up it's either \""It's being wrapped up\"" or \""It's just about done\"" which is great because my food is always fresh. \n\nWhen ever I have dined in, the staff is friendly and if the server was ever too busy, anyone working is willing to help. The food is great, I can not get enough of their italian dressing! That stuff can go on any salad or sub and just.. it's very good!"
3,"I loved the crab cakes here! They were made perfectly, very flavorful. The decor is pretty and modern with dim lights and lit candles. Very romantic. The one thing I didn't like was how the tables were all so close to each other. The restaurant is pretty big but not roomy. Our server was great, he knew how to crack jokes which kept the mood more lively. \n\nMe and the bf both ordered the ribeye which came in a pretty big portion. Although it was missing a little flavor. There wasn't anything special about it so it was just average. I wanted dessert but we were just too stuffed from the steak. I def. regret that! Although our waiter knew it was our anniversary so he brought out a plate with some chocolate and on the plate it said \""Happy Anniversary\"". That was sweet and it seriously made my night. I left happy and satisfied."
1,"We stopped here before the Viva Elvis show.  We were quickly seated in the back as some of the first dinner patrons for the evening.  We promptly informed the waiter that we had ticket for the early show and ordered a round of water while we reviewed the menu. He said he would steer us away from the long prep items.  We quickly decided on about 9 to 10 items for a table of four and two of us ordered wine by the glass.  Food started arriving and the waiter became scarce and I'm not sure why.  We finished our dishes and waited.  Desert menus were delivered but no waiter.  Finally asked for a check due to the time, not the waiter, I was inform we could speed things up by just taking my card and running it.  And we waited... I suggested my guest make the walk to the theater and I would meet them there after I paid the check.  I was informed they were having trouble with their credit card machines and they were running them manually.  Another 5 minutes and  I asked a bus boy where my credit card was and I followed him to a location near the kitchen, out of sight of most of the other guests.  While the Bus Boy was looking for the absent waiter I flagged down the manager and explained the situation.  The check arrived a few minutes later, manager tried to buy us with a couple drinks after the show.  I negotiated drinks at Sage across the lobby, but never went back to collect.  We went to Del Friscos for lemon cake instead and  wrote this review.\nFood was good, Waiter was not.\nManager was good, timing was bad.\nI know I should not grade on bad timing, but I needed to say something."
4,"Ronald's Donuts has been on my list of to try for about 3 years, but somehow I have never made it there.  The stars were aligned recently, and we were in the neighborhood to drop by.  So many to choose from, I was like a kid in a candy store.  I managed to put my tongue back in my mouth and picked out a half dozen assortment of donuts.  \n\nThe assortment was delicious.  These were not skinny like your Krispy Kreme variety.  These were fluffy pieces of dreaminess.  [see picture]\n\nThe bonus is that it's locally owned, not a major giant, so you get kind, warm and inviting service.  Goodbye Krispy Kreme.  Helloooo Ronald's Donuts!"
1,Really disappointing service.  Probably the worst I can remember.  I was with a group on a Saturday night.  The crowd was probably normal for a Saturday.  Not 100% full but busy.\nWe sat on the patio for a total of 3 hours.  I would estimate we saw our waitress a total of 4 or 5 times (counting her introduction).  We did manage to get a burger and 2 beers.  One member of the party who arrived after the others asked her to come back for a food order - she never did.\nAt the end of the evening we had to track down the manager to ask for our tab.  He generously gave us a 20% discount off our tab.  (In retrospect we should have walked out after waiting an hour with no tab to pay).\n\nI will make it a point not to stop by again.  Too bad. It's a very convenient restaurant since we live nearby.
3,"Omg... Love this place. Best milkshakes around. I am always in the south side and discovered this place about a year ago.. I went last fall and had a spooky spice milkshake... Pumpkin ice cream with hot fudge around the outside, whipped cream, chocolate shavings and candy corn... I mean... Just how incredible does that sound ? I've also had their chocolate raspberry and moose track milkshakes and they are incredible as well. I also love their chocolate strawberries- they have smaller ones and huge ones, both are incredible. The milkshake factory also sells snappers which are super addicting- but I do not purchase them there considering they sell them at costco and are a little cheaper. The milkshake factory is awesome- but their prices are why I have not given them 5 stars. They tend to run a little high.. Although they do have a milkshake happy hour in Wednesdays- half off shakes 4-6 :)"
0,"I am honestly shocked by the amazing reviews for this restaurant. We read them and went with such high expectations of amazing food and atmosphere. Maybe it was our fault we were so let down, but we won't make the mistake of going here ever again. \n\nWe walked in to find that it was a complete dive. Flies were buzzing about and servers were standing around bored. It just seemed so dirty and unkempt. Ok... maybe the food would blow us away...\n\nWe read reviews on the fabulous fresh baked bread so we knew we had to order sandwiches. My sandwich was mostly dry, shredded iceberg with a blob of mayo, dry turkey that looked like it met its fate under a lawnmower. Thank god I paid extra for avocado and bacon.... because those were the only things I could taste at all. The bread was so BLAND and plasticky. It was just... not good. And it was beyond expensive for what we got. \n\nIf you have a palate more sophisticated than that of a 4 year old, this is not the place for you."
0,"Caesar Palace should opt to not offer a buffet. To be honest, skip Lago Buffet if you can. \n\nBut if you want to eat buffet style, don't want to wait in line and want minimal food options, I recommend Lago Buffet. \n\nThe breakfast section is cornered off with just eggs, canadian bacon, hash brown potatoes and sausage. \nThe lunch selection failed. Even the pizza crust was hard. The only food I really enjoyed was the salad that I prepared myself.. \nAnd don't be fooled. The desserts look promising, but its absolutely not. The cookies were hard. The pastries were dry. And what?!- no ice cream. \n\nBut on a positive note, the zucchini bread is really good."
4,we are here and loving it.  great food and friendly service.  the top breakfsst restaurant on my list.
2,"We stayed here for 4 nights during the marillion weekend. For every plus we found, we found two minuses. \n\nPros:\nHotel lobby itself is gorgeous\nStaff were friendly/accommodating\nClose to lots of sights/subway system\nNice bed\n\nCons:\nOur room key didn't work when we first checked in and we had to wait about 45 minutes. (We were given free cocktails while we waited at least)\nOur room key somehow got deactivated again on our last night\nTINY room\nThey tried charging us for local calls we never made\nShowerhead and shower door were both broken/causing a flooded bathroom\nTwo picture frames in room were also broken on the walls\nHouse-keeping comes anywhere between noon-5pm which is super inconvenient \nEven three floors up from the Suite701 nightclub, the floor would shake and one could hear the \""thump, thump, douche, douche, douche\"" music until 4am...\nThe restaurants in the hotel are insanely expensive and don't even look at the prices for the mini-bar...*8 dollars for a bottle of water*\nWe ordered breakfast once but no real bed in breakfast trays and room only had one chair that couldn't fit in desk as the bed took up the entire room so was again inconvenient.\nWe asked for mountain view and were given room with city view which wouldn't be a con except that it faced the fire station/busy intersections and people in Montreal love to honk their horns at all hours of the night."
3,"Stayed here this past weekend and had a great time. I went to Vegas but only once left the hotel (somehow I ended up on the strip outside the wynn after a night of hard partying...still no idea how that happened). Our daily routine was order lunch via room service at 3pm (waking time) then champagne, then champagne again then have the minibar restocked from the previous nights damage....and  proceed to clean it out again. Around 10-11ish we would leave the room to go to XS and around 4am we would hit the tables. Would have been nice to see more (any) of vegas but we had a great time...until we got the room bill. Our hotel room fee was $700 and room service was $800...we didnt feel so big anymore....we transformed from rock stars to nervous teens who had crashed the family car.\nanyway if you choose to go down the same path we did - get the burger sliders (they are ground beef at its finest) with perfect onion strings, also every bottle of champagne was delish and im sure if you want to save some money (in retrospect, always a good idea) you probably wouldnt be able to differentiate the champagne from the sparkling wine. oh, and they have a room service \""happy hour\"" with corona's $5 each and some of the food for $10 a plate which is not bad compared to the regular price, trust me..."
2,"Qdoba is ok. Same idea as Chipotle Grill, but, in my opinion, the food just doesn't taste as good. The burritos don't have that magic ingredient that makes me want to return. And I did not dig the decorating scheme - especially the concrete floors and metal tables. It feels cold and dark, even in the summer."
3,"My group of about 5 girls had a grazie comp dinner for DB Brasserie so we thought that it would be perfect for us to use it for our first night in Vegas. We told the staff up front about the grazie comp and they were more than willing to accommodate us. \n\nThe grazie dinner was a prefixed 3 course menu for two. This was perfectly fine between the 5 of us since we were going to order more items just in case.\n\nWe ordered the calamari, caesar salad, oysters, French onion soup, salmon, and steak.\n\nEverything was superb! My favorites on the menu was everything except the salmon! The calamari was so delicious and the Thai flavors that they incorporated to it were subtle and not overwhelming. The Caesar salad and the oysters tasted so fresh. The French onion soup had a lot of flavor but it was a bit cold so my cousin and another girl had theirs reheated while the other girls and I enjoyed it cold (it was that good we didn't care to have it reheated). \nThe steak was cooked perfectly with delicate flavors and seasonings that didn't overpower or overwhelm you.\nAs for the salmon, it was alright. Not my favorite on the menu, but you have to eat it with the skin.\n\nFor dessert we had 3 different types of sorbet and they gave me a little birthday dessert! The sorbet was okay-- a bit tart for my liking but it definitely was a palette cleanser for sure. The birthday dessert was my fav along with 2 other girls! The chocolate and the ice cream combination was divine! Also, the chocolate was very decadent and melt in your mouth. One of the girls noted that the chocolate that they put into this was very rich and not cheap at all and I agreed.\n\nGreat experience at DB Brasserie, and a definite must try if you're at the Palazzo/Venetian! The space was very beautiful and elegant as well. Had a bit of a casual feel with a touch of class."
3,"I like buffets.  I try to eat right for the most part so a buffet has become a much rarer thing for me but I still like them quite a bit.  I really do think this is the best out of the nine or so that I have tried in Las Vegas.  I think the best time to go would be on a Saturday and Sunday for brunch.  They have pretty great breakfast food, an omelet station, and as I'm sure others have mentioned, complimentary alcohol.  I really do think the food has a good quality to it, unlike many other buffets.  I like the idea of the pre-made salads rather than a salad bar.  The desserts are pretty spectacular for a buffet and there is a wide variety of them to choose from.  My wife is a big, big fan of the Bananas Foster/Crepe dessert and so am I.  They have raised their prices since I first went when they opened and the last two times they didn't even allow us to use our players card for $2 off.  Other than that, it's well worth it and this is the only buffet I go to."
0,"EVERYONE AND ANYONE NEEDS TO KNOW HOW AWFUL THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS!! \n\nI bought a groupon thinking it would be a great experience while my husband and I and another couple visited las vegas. In the print in the groupon it says only one groupon per party so we were all four well aware that we would probably have to sit at seperate tables while we dined so we could take advantage of both groupons. \nSo we made reservations, took a cab for $30.00 to this place, ( take note this place is off the strip and first pulling up looks like a hole in the wall, grungy, not nice as you would expect from a brazillian restaruant )\nWe then proceeded to tell the employees that we have a groupon and would be sitting at different tables, different checks etc. \n\nAbout a minute passed after we were sat when a gentleman I presume must have been the owner came up and told us he could not let us use both groupons because we are the same party. At the point I said \""we are not the same party we are seperate tables seperate bills, im not even sitting with them at the same tables\"" I am not exaggerrating when I say that this business owner or whoever he was sat there and argued with me and told us that he saw us come in together same cab and although we are at different tables because of the fact we know eachother he will not let us use our groupons. He also proceeded to ask me like im some idiot \"" can you not understand me, let me explain this to you. \"" he even printed out the groupon to show me it has to be seperate parties. WE WERE IN SEPERATE PARTIES..... \n\nwe ending up leaving not using our groupon and I am so thankful for that because look at these reviews below. People get sick, the meat is raw... um the owner patricia whoever whatever she is swearing at customers who left a bad review calling them fucking liars and sad human race. Seriously what does that tell you about this establishment?????? \n\nAll of it makes sense now there was not one other person eating in this restaruant when we were in there. \n\nBERTOLUCCI BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE is BY FAR the worst customer service I have ever had.. in my life. DO NOT GO HERE. \n\nlets see what kind of restraint Patricia from Bertolucci has when responding to my review.. whether she'll cuss at me or call me a pathetic human.... \nstand up business right there."
2,"Normally I'd give this joint 5 stars bcuz almost EVERYTHING IS *AWSM*\nHowever- just went w/my moms & ewww what a disappointment :(\nShe had the fried chicken & me a basic burger - burger was ehh ok at best but the chicken was bad news bears!!! The corn bread muffin was delivered warm but turned to a rock shortly after, leading me to believe they nuked it ... The batter on the chicken was nasty & the chicken itself was ALLLL FAT! Even the mixed veggies were gross!\nAt $14 bucks this dish is NO BUENO!\nIf you find yourself @ BBD - try the Cali Benedict or the sweet cream waffle & finish w/a personal pie of your liking or the diners specialty - a  big bear bear claw ;) enjoy!"
4,Wow I must say I'm very excited about this place.   Today was the first time trying the deep dish pizza and it was excellent.   Loaded with cheese pepperoni and extra sauce.  Yum!  We will be back!
4,Called Riggs on a Saturday they were able to come out same day . They did a amazing job and the price was good will definitely use them again
3,"Went to Uncle Sals last night for dinner with a bunch of friends.  We had a great time.  Friendly, gracious and efficient service.  The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.  We had everything from seafood to chicken.  Everyone raved about their entree."
0,"The staff allowed a woman whom I nicely asked to contain her children, berate me and come back twice to tell me how \""mean and evil\"" of a person that I am for asking her to quiet her screaming children during lunch.  I asked the staff to remove her, and they simply stood and watched/listened.  I've never been treated so horribly in a restaurant.  My friend and I will not be returning, and I will share this experience with everyone that I know.  I asked for the manager, and he did not choose to help the situation by showing up.  As a former restaurant owner, I am horrified and disgusted."
2,"Nice pub, very touristy. In the upstairs part, the food is very good, but the ambiance not even remotely comparable to downstairs.\n\nDownstairs the selection of real ales is awesome. Why does leaving your business card get you sparkly wine? Why not one of these awesome beers or whiskies? I found it pretty cool that they count how many hand pumped ales they pump every week. The week before I was there: 1987. Cool."
4,"Stayed at the Wm Penn down the street for a wedding and needed a last minute haircut. Friendly, helpful, all around good cut!"
3,"I am not sure why Pizza Mia doesn't have its own business listing on Yelp. After all, they do make the best pizza in all of Montreal. Nothing else I have tried (and I have been to the highly rated pizza spots) has come close to what Pizza Mia offers. The slices are full of toppings fresh from the market a few steps away, and the dough is still the best pizza dough I have ever tasted. Their vegetarian pizza scores off the charts in the flavor department, especially with chili oil on top of it. \n\nAside from pizzas they also make and sell a myriad of other delicious food like macarons, calzones, cannollis, etc...\n\nBefore you crown one of the other good pizza places in Montreal as the best, give Pizza Mia a try!"
4,"I loved this meal so much I already want to come back for lunch tomorrow. \n\nI really appreciate the offering gluten free options for those of us with a wheat/gluten allergy. It was hard to decide which items to get, but we settled for Thai Curry Chowder, Chicken Salad Sandwich, Dragon Fries and the Pho Dip, all on gluten free bread. \n\nThe bread was thick and sturdy which held up with the huge portions of beef (Pho Dip) and ginger chicken salad in these sandwiches. The Pho was cooked a perfect medium rare, and we loved the five spice flavors with the pickled veggies. The ginger chicken salad was refreshing, loved the crunch from  the walnut, and the everything tasted fresh. \n\nThe soup was delicious, especially with the hint of coconut. Perfect to eat on a colder night. \n\nThe taro root and potato house made chips were divine. I could eat those chips all day long. We also got an order of Dragon Fries which were great, but watch out! Towards the bottom sits all the chili, but we loved it. \n\nI definitely recommend coming to this deli for lunch, dinner, whenever. Good quality food for a very good price,and a friendly staff to back it all up!"
1,OMG!!! We just came from this place and it was the worst ever.  I give two stars cause our waitress Kerri was very sweet and the busboy was nice.  I ordered orange juice and it tasted like the the film from the dishwasher detergent was still in the glass so I sent it back and the busboy brought me a new glass.  Then my husband gets his food and the eggs were to be scrambled and they were so runny and very undercooked so he put them aside and ate everything else on his plate. Then he is on his second cup of coffee and he looks down into the glass and there is a fly floating on top.  We were glad to get the heck out there.
4,"I can't say enough about how much we love this place! We first went to the farm for my son's second birthday and did the hayride and petting zoo tour. We loved picking flavors at the milk bar and hand feeding the animals. We went again after purchasing a Groupon and are now Dairy Club members. I really enjoy getting close to the source of our food and trying out all the special nosh that the chefs whip up. From peanut butter ice cream, garlic & herb butter, red pepper aioli, to the awesome chicken salad- we are hooked!"
2,"My boyfriend reeeeally enjoyed the fried chicken wings...other than that, this place was alright."
1,Was not impressed at all.\nMy husband and I split the turkey burger and mac & cheese burger. \nThe turkey burger was cold but otherwise tasty. The mac & cheese burger was not seasoned well and very bland. \nService was horrible. Our waitress was in la-la land. She explained the menu but took forever to take our order and re-fill our waters. \nWe will not return.
2,Keenly priced with a good selection of enterprising dishes on the menu and a reasonably well stocked bar.\n\n\n You'd not stop in for the whole night but definitely a very good option for off the cuff dining rather than a pre-booked affair.
0,"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.\n\nI am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThis is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \n\nAs I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service."
3,"fun joint, right on the strip you can people watch, get hammered, DJ booth coming soon right on the patio \""I heard\"" this is a deff go to place during the summer!"
1,"To be fair, let me start off by saying that this place has good food.  The reason it's getting two stars is cuz of the service.\n\nMy friends and I went here last nite partly to eat and partly to hear The Samba Project perform.  Well, we get there, it's crowded, there's a line, and I hear the couple in front of us ask the hostess how long the wait will be.  Well, instead of just giving the couple a number, the hostess was all, Well, we just sat, like, a TON of people, so I don't know.  I mean, there's one group that's been here for three hours, so you know....   Um...what?  I found that response unprofessional and unnecessary, so I was a little turned off right then.  By the time we get to the hostess, she gives us the same spiel and has us wait by the bar area (VERY little).  Luckily, the restaurant decided to open up its gates, so there was a LITTLE patio area to hang out at until our table was ready.\n\nSo, we're called probably an hour or so later, and we are seated...with no menus except the one we grabbed from the hostess when we went to wait at the bar.  John, our waiter, shows up and was all, Can I get you more drinks?  Um...sure.  But more importantly, can you grab us some more menus and take our food order?  We're hungry!!!  Not so much the case, though.  Instead, he proceeds to try and figure out who is on what tab and what tab needs to be closed at the bar, but really, there were only two tabs going: Mary and Matt's.  So John goes to close the tabs and returns with one receipt, asking, I'm sorry.  What was your name again?  Pat?  No, John.  MATT.  How did you forget in two seconds?  Then, he asks about drinks, and a few of us order iced teas.  John never mentions that they are sweetened and flavored peach, so some of them had to be returned.  Yet, upon taking those drinks away, he never asked about getting us something else to replace the drinks that some of us didn't like.  After finally taking our food order, we had to wait another 45 minutes to get our food: a few paninis with chips on the side and an order of bruschetta.  And we got that only after asking John where our food was.  He never came back to ask about more drinks or to refill waters, and I'm pretty sure that we probably could've walked out of there without having paid, and no one would have noticed.\n\nThe food was good, though, thank goodness.  I ordered the Chevito panini (flank steak with cheese, peppers, onions).  The bread was nice and toasted, and the inners really complemented the bread and the chips that came as a side.  The $10 price tag was also really do-able.  Note: You get a surprisingly filling portion of food, so go semi-hungry.\n\nThough I didn't eat any bruschetta, it looked amazing.  You can choose from three different kinds off the menu of eight or nine, and those are also of a pretty big size.  \n\nThe atmosphere is nice, the food is good, the prices are good.  The service is as if they don't know what to do or are overwhelmed with a lot of customers, the waitstaff don't really wait on you, and also a negative to note: the parking lot is way too small for the place.  \n\nI would probably go again for the food and atmosphere, but I'd really have to consider what day and what time cuz the staff is just....in need of help."
3,"I come here for lunch often. They have good lunch prices on sushi and rice/noodle bowls. The staff is always friendly. You can eat in or carry out. I usually get the lunch spicy tuna roll. It is delicious and cheap! Their miso soup is pretty good. I've never tried the bowls because I know I would go into a food coma after lunch, but they always look delicious. Some of their regular sushi rolls are a little pricey, but other than that, no complaints. A great lunch spot!"
0,"Had the worst meal of my life at Lion Brewery. \n\n1. I ordered French Onion soup as a starter. It tasted like an entire bottle of pepper had been accidentally poured into it beforehand, making it undrinkable/inedible.\n\n2. Ordered wings as the main course. They were, quite literally, battered in salt. \n\n3. Combined with the over-peppered soup and over-salted wings, my mouth was uncomfortable and on fire.\n\n4. My friend ordered a Chicken Pot Pie. He found chicken bone fragments in it.\n\nAll in all, not a good experience."
3,"Great coffee place, roasted fresh on the premises is and had interesting menu options (French lavender vanilla latte?  Get it, you won't regret it)\n\nThey also have a huge selection of fresh roasted coffee by the pound and wide tea selection.  \n\nIf you are looking for a gift for the coffee or tea lover in your life, they have a lot of cute ideas.  My favorite were the animal shaped tea infusers and unique coffee/tea cups.  \n\nGiving it 4 stars instead of 5 because there really isn't a place to sit, only 2 small bar top tables.  This is a grab and go coffee shop.  But the coffee is worth it!"
2,"bottom line mexican food for white people too scared to go to a taqueria . every entree is 2 dollars more than it should be , but that said the flavors were fine . salsas were nice and smokey ."
3,"I live within walking distance to this Target and what a treat that is, because parking is sometimes difficult. I love the pharmacy staff at this location. I also really love their women's clothing section. I am not sure why but it always seems like this Target location has the largest and best selection of clothing. They also have tons of sale items! I am not terribly impressed with some of the employees that I have encountered working the floor-some of them seem downright lazy and are not afraid to admit it to any customer within earshot of them."
0,I would give zero stars based on service and courtesy if I could. The woman in the drive thru this morning was extremely rude. Glad nobody was behind me because I backed out of the drive thru and am so glad I did since now I'm eating real food.
4,"As a fan of Gordon Ramsay, to me this place does live up to the hype!\n\nYou can say this place was built for tourists and conventioneers, but damnit, it is good!\n\nAfter seeing BurGR featured on Master Chef in a challenge, I was keen on checking this place out on my next visit to Las Vegas.\n\nMy gf and I arrived on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon to a short line up.  We took a gander at the amazing flaming signage of BurGR inside Planet Hollywood. Within 10 minutes, we were promptly seated.\n\nOur server Brandon was very welcoming and friendly, making us feel at ease.  Throughout the lunch service, he regularly checked in on us and made sure our waters were refilled. He also recommended a great beer pairing with my burger.   Since my gf loves ice tea (the kind you get in Canada), Brandon was aware that Las Vegas didn't have it so he had the bar made up something similar that more than met her standards for a great lemony iced tea, which made her very happy! \n\nI had the Farm burger while she had the Euro burger.  Cooked to medium rare, the burgers were juicy and melt in your mouth.  Balanced perfectly, my Farm burger's duck bacon and fried egg, more than complimented the flavors of the juicy beef patty.  The Euro burger according to her could have used a little less blue cheese, but nevertheless she thought it was amazing still with arugula!  The burger buns were fluffy and crisp, as were the fantastic truffle fries, whose portions were more than enough to share for two persons!\n\nSign up for Total Rewards (it's FREE!) to get $1 off all of the items on the menu!\n\nWell done Ramsay and staff, you donkey!! ;-)"
3,"The crab cake is the best in town. If you order the Caesar salad with salmon, request it to be blackened. Game changer. If you are into beef, go for the marinated flank steak. Heaven on a fork. \n\nThe bar is very good sized and has full service for food and lots of TV's. \n\nBon apatite."
3,"I ate here because they have all you can eat crab legs on Wednesday and Thursday. On a night like this I would expect a full house and line. The restaurant was busy but there was never a line. I like that I didn't have to fight the crowd to get some crab. They also had a salad bar, meat, fish, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, sweet and sour chicken, chow mein, tacos, hush puppies, and rolls. The crab legs and tri tip were great and the rest of the food was okay. We left completely satisfied and can't wait to go back."
0,"5points was the listing agent in my recent transaction.  I have emails in which Mr. Wilson promises to stand up to his commitments, but of course he did not.   If you are a buyer, stay the heck away."
4,If you want to try something different and excellent try Le Chalet. The food and service is very good with menu items you will not fine in many places. They also have a full bar and happy hour.
3,"A few months ago, when it was that horrible cold outside that just made you want to stuff your face with comfort food and drink hot toddies, we got a pizza in Rapido on our way home.  \n\nMy man had eaten here before and vouched for the food, but I hadn't, so it was a new experience.  We decided on one of their \""gourmet\"" pizzas with the lovely thin Italian base.  We wanted to add peppers to our Estiva (cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil - basically a posh version of a Margherita) but we were told NO WAY.  At first I was put off - it's going in MY belly, why shouldn't I be able to put anything I want on it?  But then I remembered the Italian restaurant where I used to work.  Sometimes people would want to tweak dishes and my boss said absolutely no way - he didn't want the uneducated masses ruining his perfect combination of flavours.  The guy at Rapido was the same.  He said he would make any pizza we wanted for the normal pizza, but not his gourmet pizza, it just wasn't on.  \n\nSo we gave in and waited.  \n\nWhen our pizza was ready, we headed outside in the horribly dreary weather to walk 10 minutes down the road to home.  \nUnfortunately, by the time we'd arrived, the pizza was pretty much cold.  However, the flavour was wonderful and we gobbled it right up, vowing to get it home quicker next time so we could eat it piping hot.  \n\nIt really was just what you would picture when getting a good Italian thin crust pizza."
3,"This is a great bagel place conveniently located inside the Edinburgh Waverly train station.  The staff are friendly and quick and nicely package your coffee and bagel selection for a quick carry onto your next train.\n\nOptions for different bagels spanned from sausage , egg and cheese to Salmon to just spreads.  They had quite a few combinations.\n\nNext time I am back to this train station, this will be my go to breakfast place!"
0,"The customer service here was terrible, getting estimate is very hard. The guy who answered the phone on 9/10/12 around 4:45 pm actually hung up in my face because he couldn't another guy name Mike. Don't waste your time like I did. I read the other comments that were listed and wanted to try them for myself, unfortunately some of the comments are true regarding the customer service. I feel bad for the owner, because as a business owner myself it's very hard to find good employees and ultimately they are a reflection of the company as a whole."
3,"This is my automatic go to place when I am at work.\n\nThey deliver, and I am a work-a-holic and don't leave my seat often. The delivery guys have a great sense of humor because between 11-2pm we keep them repeatedly coming back here. No one communicates when they are getting JJ's, you just hear \""JJ's is here!\"" and someone comes running for their food.\n\nExtremely fast and friendly service. The ordering online is a HUGE plus for me.\nAny sandwich I have gotten from them has been amazing but let me highlight the Bread and Mayo. Their fresh french bread rolls and real mayo is out of this world.\n\nYou can order your sandwich as an \""Un-wich\"" with a lettuce wrapping instead of bread, but I am not sure I would have the will power to do this.\n\nThe only thing I would love to see them offer is a cheese steak. That would be amazing.\n\nBottom line: I like JJ's and am impatiently waiting for them to build one closer to my house so they deliver there too."
3,Tried them during restaurant week. Loved the atmosphere. Very polished. Food was fine. Server was awesome. I enjoyed the lobster risotto- it was little salty for me. My husband had the short ribs and they were meh. Nothing to write home about but we have had better elsewhere. Glad I tried it but I would probably not go again and pay full prices.
0,"I usually say that Nello's has the best pizza but tonight we had the worst experience. The food wasn't that great, and some of the servers were horrible.  There was a man who seemed to be part of the management team, well he knew all the regulars  and carried on with each one of them while cursing.  Mind you I was sitting by the bar but had a family sitting behind me, children shouldn't fall subject to a manager's lack of common decency to watch his language while working.  We then asked if we could have the tv that was facing us changed to a particular channel, when our waiter asked the manager for help he said and I quote \""tell them to turn their head and watch the tv they see it on\"". At this point I was furious, had we not already received our food we would have walked out, but wait it gets better.  So then a group comes in who happen to be regular's, and they ask for the same tv to be changed and guess who jumps on this, yup!  I didn't get this man's name but he was the oldest person on staff with an east coast accent and wore black framed glasses.  All I can say is that this experience will definitely affect the choice I make the next time I want pizza, Nello's won't be my first choice."
0,"I stayed here once, and once was enough for me... The hotel was clean, that's were the good qualities end...\n\nThe staff was, not so much rude, just... blank would be the best way to describe them. The rooms, and hotel itself, were very small. The room had 2 beds and a TV stand which left just enough room for 1 person to walk between them (and we had 3 guys staying there, talk about crowded). The doors around the hotel all lock behind you, meaning (and I found out the hard way, due to a slow elevator) you can't take the stairs... If you go into the stairwell you have to go all the way to the ground level, go outside (it was raining that night), walk around the building back to the front, and if it's past a certain hour you have to wait for the Front Desk clerk to buzz you in. The parking's the other thing... This is more a personal thing for me, I like to have my car parked in a garage when I'm on vacation. They have an outdoors parking lot up the block (which some might not think is in the greatest of neighborhoods). The bigger pain is, you have to get a new parking pass for your car every day it's in the lot. This can be annoying because if you do it in the morning you have to deal with the Check In wait.\n\nAll in all I personally had a horrible experience in this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone... The only reason we stayed here was because we decided to take the trip late and all our other choices were booked up."
1,Totally edible chain restaurant food. Nothing exciting.
4,"We were in for a treat.Piero was there and he did the honors!!!The friend who invited\nme has known Piero ever since he came to LasVegas. I had veal scalipini, tossed salad.,and potates lyonnise(Sp). Ugo had Orange roughy, schrimp scampi, Caesars salad. We split a plate of fried ocra, complements of Don Pierio.It makes a great\nappetizer. Our food was exceptional and done to a turn. Signore Piero made the rounds and presented himself to each table. As of this writing, Piero is the ambience. \nChloe needs to invest in some chianti bottles, waiters with old school white /black\nuniforms, and a mustache pete stuck in the corner with  a red checkered bib( hung\nfrom his collar) to keep Piero's dyno  veal parmesan from stainin' duh corbat.\nI don't remember the pricing. Prices were printed on the menu. So how bad\ncan they be? I'm going back regardless of pricing.  I will say finding a SPECTACULAR Italian ristorante like this,sandwiched between a \""craft\"" store and Art's Bail Bonds,\nis the kind of juxtaposition I can live with. Molto beni."
2,"We stayed at Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa because of the package deal from Travelocity B. found.  It's about 30 minutes from the strip, so if you have a car it's an ok place to stay.  Free parking.\n\nThey charge a $27.99 Resort Fee.  Bogus, nobody swims in the Winter because it's outside and cold and all we got for it was a FREE newspaper every morning.  Stupid.\n\nThey have a Bowling Alley - extra charge.  Spa - extra charge.  Regal movie theater- extra charge.\n\nThere's 2 Starbucks, TBone a fancy looking meat place open for dinner, not sure about lunch.  Grand Cafe - meh food - we had breakfast there one time - Extra charge  $7.95 for a nasty bowl of oatmeal w/ sides like brown sugar, cherries, walnuts.  B. got a SW Special he couldn't finish.  Charged it to the Room.  They wouldn't give us a free dessert - said it was for Dinner only. Bogus.\nFood court - we walked through, nothing good.\n\nB. did drink lots at the bar below the lobby.  He got 1 FREE drink, but he bought maybe 3-4 the whole time.\n\nRoom: huge King size bed, TV, Tub w/ TV, and separate shower.  Separate door for toilet.  2 sinks.  Hair dryer.  Didn't have coffee pot which I really needed!  If something is missing at the snack bar let them know ASAP otherwise they will charge you for it!  Mini bar if something is missing after a few seconds - Charged.\n\nAn ok place to stay."
0,Big puddle in the floor on the to go side waited 15 minutes for an order that was supposed to be ready ten minutes ago. Finally left after being ignored by staff. Will not be returning.
3,3 1/2 stars. Doesn't have the number of rolls that most places have. \n\nA little joint in a strip mall. I was afraid to go in but we were with friends who rave about it. There was only one other table when we arrived but many more when we left. We all did AYCE. Delivery was fairly quick. Cajun is amazing. We loved the super crunch roll although we ordered a second after devouring the first and it was not the exact same roll. Ordered snow crab twice and never got it.  They cut off our ordering on two different occasions. \n\nThis is not really close to areas of town we frequent. I had been craving AYCE and this definitely filled my itch. If you are in the area and looking for a place you should give it a shot.
4,"We grabbed antoher quick meal in here tonight and they pulled it off yet again. The food was great, the service was friendly and Unlike last time I saw that they offer free Wi-Fi for customers.  Feel free to order the carne asada yelp... It's Excellent."
3,"If you fancy going for a walk in Edinburgh, then you are spoilt for choice! However, sometimes places like the Meadows can be too busy on a hot summer's day, and sometimes you want to escape the many tourists who ascend Arthur's seat! Well, one great walk that I have been on is the Water of Leith walkway.\n\nThe walkway follows the rive right down to the Leith dockyards, however en route there are many nice areas to walk, many which make you feel that you have escaped from the city! The walkway is well signposted and the great thing about it is that you can leave it and rejoin it at certain points. Great for if you want to visit the art galleries near the walkway such as Dean Gallery or the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.\n\nIt is also suitable and indeed a favourite with cyclists. \n\nWith twists and turns, this walk gives you a chance to explore more than one part of Edinburgh."
2,"BBQ Sauces are what I enjoyed most!  The Sauces are close to 4 yelp stars\n\nOne of the three \""linemen\"" wanted to be helpful and was very patient while his co-workers were interrupting as if there others behind me waiting... Guess they are trained herders which is OK with me... This level of Service is OK.... I give the Service 4 stars for Entertaining Borderline Rudeness, it is entertaining enough for 4 stars or close enough\n\nHow was the food?  3 stars or less! Wish I were eating Korean!  Ready, Steady GO: \n\nPulled Pork good flavor, just no better than \""good\"" 3 stars \nBeef Sausage 2.76 stars\nBrunswick Stew 2.45 stars\nBeef Brisket 1.73 stars\n\nExtras not counted : \nCollard Greens 2.72 stars\nHush Puppies 3 stars\n\nThe Dude mostly taking my order should be working in a MUCH Higher Scale Restaurant!!!  Your efforts are appreciated and if the manager says hurry the customers, remember One Day you will get to work in an Industry where your Talents are VALUED! !! !!!"
3,"Food was great and give you plenty to eat. Menu on wall didn't have a lot of selection. If there was another menu I was never offered one so not sure if there is more to offer. Food came out quick so didn't have to wait long. Would  come back here again, just hope  there is more of a variety."
4,"This place is INCREDIBLE!! Right down the street from Meadows mall you can hit the grocery shopping after clothes shopping. \n\nThe parking lot is always packed when I go but it's worth it - people coming, people going. I have YET to come across a rude Cardenas shoppers, unlike at another hispanic grocery market. They all look unhappy, unless they are coming out KNOWING they're heading for Cardenas ; ) \n\nCustomer service is great, produce is good, fresh meats, fresh bread, and the food court they have is oh my, delicious!! It's always clean and never closely together where you run into other shoppers. It isn't pricey either, unless you're a cheapskate, but even then you can find deals in here."
0,"If I could give no stars, I would.  The service here was horrible, which is weird because there seemed to be several waitresses, a busboy, definitely a manager of some kind, and some random hipsters that you could have thought were customers, until you got up to get your own menu (see note about bad service above), and then they got up and got it for you.  The service did not get better once I ordered mediocre food, the busboy brought all the food, and some random French fries no one claimed.  When I got my tomato soup and grilled cheese, the bus boy realized the random French fries from before actually were mine, so he just brought back the same fries.  They were cold by this time.  Communicating with them seemed to be difficult, either they did not listen or did not care, one of the two.  Dessert was ok, but certainly not worth enduring bad service and average food."
2,First time...food was great...can't wait to go to a moes that's not at the airport!
2,"Good place - it really helps I can walk here because, I probably would never come otherwise. Don't get me wrong - it's an interesting place - food is good - but, overall it's a dive you go to for a night cap. \n\nNot very family friendly. The new patio is over-crowded with smokers and you have to walk right by it to the front door...unless you know to use the back. It's not like they don't want families here - it's just not the best place for young ones (unless they are into looking at stuffed animal heads)\n\nI know my review doesn't sound too good however, I'd say give 'em a shot and try for yourself. I live pretty close and maybe go once a year - and ten years ago it was once or twice a month so....I think I just found better places to spend a buck."
1,"The noise,lights and animals are merely a cover-up for the slow service, lackluster food and expensive dishes. Don't expect to add a house salad to your $12.48 turkey wrap ladies and gents here they want 4.49 to add it as a side. $37+ later we won't come again."
4,"Yay! Such a pretty and happy place! The exterior is super run down shopping center style, all the shops are Viet named. There are like 3 non asians at tables and people are eating proper vietnamese food! \n\nNext pricing! Damn this mother is cheap! Pho tai 4.50 two rolls 2.25. Coffee...i didnt notice price of!\n\nTables are strewn with yummy looking food and big leaves of fresh lettuce and and and and...though it looks like they have gotten the mexican lime (lemon) on the list.\n\nSo...I gotta say...this may be in my top 10 viet joints out there. The Pho broth coulda used a little more...something...but the spring rolls were awesome, the decor and people and oh...the coffee...yes...very good too...\n\nI left here fully satisfied and without any feelings of...hmmmm...coulda done xyz better and bla bla bla...Unless someone sends me a note or a comment that suggests I try another joint in town (and has at least 10 reviews of different viet places on their list), I don't think that I need to look any further for Vietnamese food in Phoenix...\n\nOh yeah...and it is FLIPPING CHEAP!  I had: Pho Tai (meat on side), Spring Rolls, Iced Coffee Milk and I spent...12 bucks with a 30% tip!  Normally that'd be like 17 with a 12% tip..."
4,"Just gorgeous!!  A real treat  of a walk!  I did this on my own and was just entertained beyond belief!!  It's a bit touristy, as I was, so I get it.. I live in a touristy part of SF, so I try to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear.  I wish I would have bought some Cashmere or a tartan skirt!  2 real regrets! The pics I took were fabulous.. great photo ops!!  I wish I would have gotten on a tour, though."
4,Best pho place in az.
3,"What a great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The beer list is extensive and amazing!  There is something on there for everyone, whether or not you are a beer lover.  The food is equally amazing- the steamed mussels are one of my favorites.  It's a fun, energetic atmosphere.  I always make sure to hit this place up whenever I am in town."
1,"Great hotel, but be cautious of the hidden fees. They will charge your credit card without your approval and dislike children staying there."
4,"I recently stayed at The Mirage for my birthday. This was my first time going to Vegas and I was not 100% soled that I wanted to go. After all, I don't gamble. My ideal destination was to head to the Caribbean because I love the beach and the clear blue water. However my friend assured me that I would enjoy Vegas, that there was a lot more to do besides gambling,  and she picked out a hotel with a great pool. Well, I had a fabulous time! The pool was the best ever, and I felt like I was in the Caribbean with the palm tress and the waterfalls. It was so relaxing!!! Our hotel room was AWESOME, and the service was great! In short, I did  not want to leave Vegas but most of all, I did not want to leave The Mirage."
1,"There's free parking in the back which is a plus & with your receipt, you get 10% off any souvenirs in the upstairs gift store.  The food's ok but one of our group of 5 substituted the touted mac n cheese instead of fries but when his plate came, no mac n cheese.  The waitress dumbfoundedly stated what? no fries either? when it was brought to her attention!!"
1,"This restaurant was a joke! We were seated right away but it took nearly 45 min for them to bring us our food! The price was rediculous $18 for a burrito that was tiny, we were charged for the chips and salsa that we didn't even order! Robertos puts the to shame when it comes to real Mexican food, real service and a bang for your buck!!!"
3,"I judge a Vietnamese place by its pho and pork combination rice plate. The pho was not overly seasoned and the noodles were tender and didn't stick into clumps. The grilled pork didn't have enough seasoning and garlic, but wasn't bad. Would definitely consider this as an go to place for some good Vietnamese comfort food."
0,do not book here !!!! cockroaches everywere! it looks old i swear it does not look like the picture ! false advertisement your better of staying in your car. i booked with them through a thrird party and trust me we decided to pay the cancelation fee then to stay there with cockroaches and a rude i mean rude ass old trailer trash bitter receptionist patti. this hotel doesnt even deserve a star. patti the receptionist is a bitch as soon as we walked in she didn't even want to look up our reservations. she didn't want to take my dads credit card because the name was shortened. she was also very rasist. never again this hotel should be shut down its just taking up space! do not book here once again. even the stupid manager had an attitude !
3,"Waiters are awesome and the food is great. I do wish the owner would allow you to order the \""la Potence\"" beef tenderloin  medium instead of rare. Best dessert in town."
3,"Some of the fellas (and one lady) from work tapped me on the shoulder and said that they were headed here for lunch.  I drove over there to meet them and to try out some pizza.  They have a great deal M-F for lunch.... 2 slices cheese and a drink for only $4.10!   Can't beat that!  The pizza was good...crisped up in the oven nice.  The cheese looked a tad greasy but it was not...no puddles to be found anywhere.  The sauce was just alright but the crust made up for it.  Really good crust! The slices were really big too!  Score!   Service was to the point, not friendly, not rude but you could tell that they were appreciative for your business.  It's only a mile or so from work so I'm sure I will be back for that killer lunch special.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food too!"
1,I wouldn't come back here again especially for the price. I've heard great reviews about this place. But the only thing great about this buffet is the crabs! The rest of the food was BLAH! - J
3,Great food using local sources.  Really cool casual vibe.  Love it!
4,"Last time I gave them 4 stars but I'm giving them 5 now bcuz Dr.Fliesher is the BEST!! Screw the wait time I would wait anyday for DR.Fliesher to deliver my baby. 6 weeks ago he delivered my son and I have to say he is amazing.  I have 2 kids my daughter I gave birth to in NY and I also had a great doctor there but he really knows what he's doing. I was iffy about him at first, I was really thinking about changing to a different doctor but I'm real glad I didn't. If u want a good doctor to deliver your baby he's the one! I had no problems"
4,"I just moved to Las Vegas in June and have been trying out different nail salons and Frenchie Nails is the BEST!\nI got a gel manicure and if that's what you need, definitely go see Lisa!  She was so sweet and really knows what she's doing.  My nails have never looked better!\nThank you Lisa!!!!!"
1,"Over rated. Better food else where. Waitress did not bother to refill my iced tea when she brought over refills for my husband and son. My turkey club sandwich - dry. Although I did enjoy the small side of Cesar salad, hence the 2 stars."
2,"I still have lukewarm feelings about this place.  It isn't the warm place you go to, to feel loved and like they know you.  I've only been here twice and I don't think anyone here is entertained by my (what I believe to be) witty comments.\n\nIt's a little intimidating at first because I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb.  I'm not one to be flashy or necessarily into the beauty aspect of my looks so I generally tend to feel out of place at salons anyway, let along a salon where everyone where's black.  \n\nThe receptionist has always been nice, although not one to engage in small talk or humoring a \""smart\"" patron such as myself.  She's a busy bee so I'll let her off the hook.  I like the fact that she seems to be a hard worker.\n\nTechnical: 5 stars on my eyebrow job.  I felt like a new woman.  I've never had my eyebrows waxed before but because I've always been afraid that I would have to draw them in (*ahem* not that there's anything wrong with that, I guess) but damn it, Kim (?) did a great job.  I will definitely be going back once they get a little too bushy to handle...\n\nOkay, so I do watch Tabitha's Salon Make-Over or whatever that show is called.  And I do think that their wax pot needs some cleaning.  I'll have to do a little more investigation on that the next time I go.  Update to come up in about a month.\n\nI haven't had any other service from Polished... Shortly after I went the second time, I got an e-mail saying they let 8 girls go and I was wondering if that was a response to my not making appointments.  But seeing as a couple of the other patrons on yelp say that they've had to wait long periods, I will do everyone a favor and start making appointments."
3,"For being down the street from my house, I tend to forget about Jun's when the Korean mood strikes. I am not sure why, but this whole complex tends to be a blackout zone on my radar. \n\nWhen I walked in around 11:30am, all the employees were having lunch before everyone came. I sat down at a table and was quickly greeted and asked about something to drink. After a minute, my server was back with my water and took my order. \n\nSince it was my first time here, I wanted to try as much as possible without going overboard. Instead of ordering an insane amount of food,rI ordered the Jun's Special. Consisting of bulgogi, kalbi, chicken, meat jun, rice, salad, and a fried dumpling, it was enough of a taste. It was pretty standard fare. I subbed out the white rice with brown for an extra $.50. It was dry and could have been cooked with more water. The meat jun and kalbi were my favorite. The mandoo was very crisp and the filling was predominately meat. It was not just a bunch of veggies and noodles like other places. The spices inside was spot on. I might just order a plate of this the next time I go. For $11.95, it is a diverse taste of their meat offerings. I am excited about the cold buckwheat noodles. They start serving that from June to September."
2,"The airport is okay as far as large hub airports go. However, the security checkpoint is small with a pretty bad bottle neck for screening. I found this to be a bit slow and crowded more space would have been appreciated and made this a more pleasent experience. \n\nOn the upside baggage claim divisions were well spread out to prevent crowding with good signage and listings of where to go for your particular flight.  The fountain outside by the ground transport sites makes a nice view while waiting for your ride or shuttle.\n\nOverall okay airport, not bad or great, just okay."
1,Food was ok the burritos come with just meat nothing else. So if you order the chicken burrito you are going to get a tortilla filled with shredded chicken. Their floutas were good I would go back for them especially with their salsa.
3,Old hotel but always filled with guest and tourists. The Jaba was a great addition to this hotel!
2,"We usually end up here after meandering through the cavernous Caesar's Palace for a couple of hours.  \n\nIt's sure a sight to behold.  One never knew that ancient Rome had so many high end speciality shops lining its streets.  You could spend a fortune here buying new clothes to get all gussied in up for a night out on the town.\n\nWith each new turn and passing store front, I keep hoping to see a Wal Mart or Kohls or T. J. Maxx that would allow a lowly minion like me to set foot inside the premises, but alas none are to be found in here.\n\nSo have to hang on to my dollars till I get downtown to the Pioneer Club to do my souvenir shopping there.\n\nWe did try dining at the Planet Hollywood Restaurant inside the Forun Shops once only to be told it was closed for a private party.  Drats!"
2,Harkins Camelview IS the go to theater for independent and foreign films.\n\n But have you ever seen a film there where the screen is soooo small that you should have visited your rich uncle and watched his TV??\n\nThere are only two great screens and a few tiny ones.\n\nCome on man! Huge ticket prices and a tiny theater? Why not scale the ticket price down like the price is scaled up for the Capri screens?\n\nJust wondering.
2,Decent location best accessible if driving North or East.  There are lots of gas pumps here.  Fountain soda selection is good but they can't beat Circle K's prices.  I think their grill has some interesting options and occasionally I will get a hot dog.  They also have shakes and frozen coffee drinks available here.  A nice change of routine.
2,Reasonable place located about a mile away from the strip!  Rooms are not bad either!  Wish the waiter service was better!
3,"For first timers, park along Invergordon Rd, south of the turn on Cholla Lane. Do not park on Cholla. It will make the local hillside folk quite sour and your car might be towed. Walk up and access the trail from Cholla. And, voil\u00e0 - your warm up is complete!\n\nThe reviews are correct. This side of Camelback mountain is an easier hike compared to Echo Canyon. The terrain here is somewhat more slippery and the rock separations will test your balance and ankle strength. Be sure to wear appropriate shoes to keep you steady. Take your time and you can choose your own path towards the top. \n\nOne of the best times to come is before sunrise. Nearby parking should still be available and you shouldn't need a headlamp. I would shoot for a 5am start on the trailhead to get your money's worth. The view will be wonderful. \n\nAdvanced Challenge: Do an \""over and back.\"" Head up Cholla and go down Echo Canyon. Drink some water and turn right 'round, baby, right 'round. Back up Echo and down to where you started.\n\nHappy Hiking Phoenix!"
1,Totally average experience. Service was s.l.o.w.... The hummus plate was bland and boring with the pita bread stale and all curly in the edges. Save your money on that dish.
1,"We hadn't been to a Feast buffet in a while, so my husband surprised me when he said he wanted to try it.  Little did we know it would be an 1hr in line and the food was old.  It turns out that Wednesdays are senior days at all Stations casino's, so be weary if you are gonna go be sure it's worth your wait and then when you're done, expect to still be hungry!"
1,"Ok, since it's an Asian restaurant, bad service and long waits are acceptable as long as the food is good. \n\nFor the last 2 months, the pho has been great. It was the best pho restaurant that I have found in Phoenix and I have been recommending this place non-stop. I don't know what is going on today, maybe the chef is sick or something, but the pho was terrible. It was just lazily prepared. The beef slices were thick instead of thin like it was the last 10 times I've been there. My bowl felt like a bunch pho ingredient was thrown in and topped off with beef stock. Nothing worked together, there were no flavor. There was nothing I could do to make it taste well. I will stop recommending this restaurant for now but will give it another try later on. If this is how this place is going to be from now on, I will no longer come. If it improves, I will definitely update the review to 4 stars like it deserves. Minus one star for service and wait for food."
2,"its a typical 3.5-star restaurant. Nothing special - even their famous beer is not that great anymore. \n\nIt doesnt mean their quality has fallen - today, we have a lot of restaurants/bar serving all kinds of beer from around the world. This makes G&B not so special anymore (it was 10 years ago).\n\nHowever, if you like watching basketball and football games, this is a place to go. They even have happy hours - you get $1 discount on all beers! Only a dollar but it counts. \n\nOther happy hour meals were like 5, 6, 7 dollars and they seem to be ok. I didnt order any of them - I dont order food based on the price. You live only once. Eat what you wanna eat. Then maybe you will get heart attack and die happily. Yes, food here is very greasy."
0,"I would NOT recommend this company.  The technician was extremely rude; I almost sent him away.  I was overcharged, and charged a service fee when the website clearly states \""No Service Fee for Any Repair.\""  I called the manager to express my dissatisfaction and complaints, and he said he'd have the owner call me.  I tried to give him another phone number to call me back on and he said \""no, I have other calls\"" and hung up.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!"
2,"This was the first store we hit when we got to Fashion Show Mall.\n\nWe dont have a Hot Topic in Canada. I always enjoy going to stores we don't have.\n\nThis location wasn't overly big. Mostly Tshirts, cheap jewelry and \""Mall GothFashion\""\n\nI wasn't in the mood to try any clothes on or I would of checked out a few skirts I saw.\n\nWe only bought a few cosmetic items, bright blue & green liquid eyeliner, and a white eyeshadow. They were all on clearance which is funny since I only use high end cosmetics.  But I had forgot some of my makeup at home, and brightly colored liquid liner is sometimes hard to find.\n\nThe girl who rang us up had super cool nails. She wasnt overly friendly but did tell us how the salon did the tips all glittery.\n\nI now kinda wish I would of tried that skirt on ... Hmmm another reason to return to Vegas sooner, then later."
2,"3.5 stars. Let's start off with the positives: Service was very, very good. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, quick to refill water, and was basically perfect.\n\nHowever, the 3 stars above indicate something wrong with the experience, and that something was the food itself.\n\nI had the Kobe Beef Burger with Provolone and my fiancee ordered the Hubert Keller burger and fries. Fries were pretty good. Nice texture, nice flavor, but nothing amazing.\n\nThe Hubert Keller burger had a solid combination of flavors, with nice play between the cheese, the meat, and the sauce. If both burgers were as decent as the Hubert Keller burger, I would've probably leaned towards four stars. However, my Kobe beef burger, despite only being cooked to medium and still nice and pink inside, was really dry and flavorless. There was just not enough fat in my burger. No juiciness. And since the burger was very basic other than the cheese, there was nothing else to mask the forgettable patty. Perhaps I should have added some truffle and foie gras to liven it up, but then I'd just be enjoying those things, rather than the burger itself.\n\nIf you're going to come here, spend a bit more and get their specialty burgers, I guess. Wanted to like this place because Hubert Keller is the man, but left feeling a wee bit disappointed."
2,"I've been back here a couple of times and...it's leaving a bit to be desired. They never seem to have my size in the sports bras I want, and the past two times I've been there no employee has offered to help me (yes, I can ask but...if it's your business...then...). \n\nI think I'm gonna hunt around for another place to get my gear."
3,"Eines vorweg: In diesem Chinarestaurant habe ich bislang nur das Mittagsbuffet kennengelernt. Die Bewertung bezieht sich ausschliesslich darauf.\n\n\n Mittlerweile gehen wir einmal w\u00f6chentlich zu diesem chinesischen Restaurant. Das Buffet wird st\u00e4ndig aufgef\u00fcllt, so dass es fast immer genug von allem hat. Meine Lieblingsgerichte hier sind die acht Kostbarkeiten und das H\u00fchnchen in Curry. Fazit: Solide Kost zu einem vern\u00fcnftigen Preis ohne Wartezeiten."
1,"This is a 2.5 star review, but I can't go higher.  It's not that the food was bad, it was fine.  In fact, we got the shrimp tempura as an appetizer, and it's probably the best version of tempura I've had.  Very close to the best if not actually the best.  Textbook, crispy but not greasy.  Impressive.\n\nHowever, the rest of the meal was only average, but the prices are for above average cuisine.  The pork was similar to what we get from our local Chinese delivery, and for a lot more money.  The black bean shrimp was solid, but the other dishes left something to be desired.  If the prices were about 30% less, it would get 3 stars.  But, even with the location at Bellagio, I expected more.\n\nService was fantastic, water glasses never empty.  Very polite."
4,"Anyone who says Phoenix lacks culture has yet to visit Symphony Hall. Symphony Hall reflects a sense of Arizona culture in the sense that the architecture reminds of Frank Lloyd Wright's work. The Hall is beautiful and very spacious. Upon stepping foot through the doors of Symphony Hall, I immediately get the sense of being in a booming metropolis. The staff is friendly and helpful and they even have a local shop where you can buy different gifts. \n\nThe acoustics at Symphony Hall are very nice and I doubt there's a bad seat in the house. The symphony does an excellent job with their quality and sound level of their music and it compliments the performers on stage...even a cat's meow would sound beautiful! The entire performance center is gorgeous and I think it's a must-visit if you live in Phoenix. You have your choice between the Symphony, Ballet AZ and the Opera so pick your performance poison and discover Symphony Hall!"
4,"I have seen some magic shows in Vegas, and Mac King has beat out the others on so many levels.  You don't even need a drink to start laughing!  Yes, his act is that funny! \n\nHis tricks don't involve a lot of smoke and mirrors or showgirls and that's what makes it more impressive.  He can pull off a comedy act which could have stood on its own, but he incorporates wonderful, new tricks involving a \""cloak of invisibility,\"" a goldfish, and a man in a bear suit.  Wow! \n\nDid I mention that prices are VERY resasonable?  A tip:  Go to some ushers standing in Harrah's and ask them for the \""two for one\"" coupon to see Mac King.  They will claim that they don't have them, but slip them a 10 (that's Vegas for you) and see if their answer changes."
0,absolutely terrible service. waited room to be prepared for two hours after check in. key to room doesn't work. no reparations.
3,"Another great place in Pittsburgh to get Sichuan food. Other place is How Lee's but I think both are pretty much the same.\n\nThey not only have Sichuan food but they also have non-spicy traditional Chinese food. They are pretty decent but you could probably get the same dishes elsewhere that are better tasting and cheaper. So I highly recommend getting the Sichuan dishes.\n\nDishes I recommend:\n\nFu Qi Fei Pian (\u592b\u59bb\u80ba\u7247) - Beed tripe, tendon, tongue in Chili Oil (My Absolute Favorite)\nShijin Mao Xue Wang (\u4ec0\u9326\u6bdb\u8840\u65fa)- Pork Blood Tofu, Intestines, Fish Fillet and Beef Tripe\nJiang Bei Shui Zhu Yu (\u6c5f\u5317\u6c34\u716e\u9b5a)- Fish Fillet in Spicy Broth, Chongqing Style\nSan Bei Ji (\u4e09\u676f\u96de)- Chicken with Basil (This is okay here, better at Rose Tea)\nYu Xiang Huo Jiang Chao Qie Zi (\u9b5a\u9999\u6216\u91ac\u7092\u8304\u5b50) - Chinese Eggplant in Garlic Sauce or Soy Sauce\nGan Bian Si Ji Dou (\u4e7e\u6241\u56db\u5b63\u8c46) - Dry Sauteed Green Beans with Minced Pork\nCheng Du Liang Fen (\u6210\u90fd\u6dbc\u7c89)- Chengdu Bean Jello Noodle\nDan Dan Mian (\u64d4\u64d4\u9eb5) - Dandan Noodles with Minced Pork\nMu Er Hua Rou Pian (\u6728\u8033\u6ed1\u8089\u7247) - Pork with Wood Ear Mushrooms\nHong Shao Ti Pang (\u7d05\u71d2\u8e44\u8180) - Braised Pork Shoulder\nChong Qing La Zi Ji (\u91cd\u6176\u8fa3\u5b50\u96de) - Fried, diced Chicken with dried pepper, Chongqing style (This is extremely spicy. Eat it if you dare)\n\nThings I recommend not to get:\nSan Xian Sa Guo Dou Fu (\u4e09\u9bae\u7802\u934b\u8c46\u8150) - Chicken, Jumbo Shrimp, Pork, Tofu in Casserole (Compared to the Spicy dishes this is extremely flavorless. I guess if you do want to get this, make sure nothing overpowers it or you won't taste anything)\n Xiang Yu Kou Rou (\u9999\u828b\u6263\u8089) - Steamed Pork with Taro (Tiny portion, with very little taro)"
2,"My wife works near here so we decided to meet for lunch. Pretty good place to eat. Nothing bad about the place but nothing exceptional. Had the turkey club sandwich and it was ok. Again, not bad but not great. Just good enough to meet my wife for a convenient lunch. Would come back for lunch with the wife again. She had buffalo chicken wrap and she says she'd give it a 3 star too. Server was nice and friendly and no long wait for food or drinks. Would recommend for a quick meal if you're in the area."
3,"I love corn dogs! Pay no attention to the mesmerizing colors of the their uniforms and to that really funny hat. You could say that I am indeed a Hot Dog on a Stick fan. For some reason they have the best corn dogs I have ever tasted and the dogs are always cooked to perfection. The fresh lemonade here is excellent. Try the cheese on a stick, I know it sounds disturbingly unhealthy and gross but in a non cardiologist point of view, I find myself actually liking this deep fried concoction. The french fries here at the Boulevard mall is the best out of all the locations in Las Vegas. \n\nIf you like corn dogs and lemonade, this place is for you."
4,Words cannot describe the great flavors of their items. This is a 'must try' place.
3,"Everything I have eaten here is delicious...a little pricey for lunch, but worth it. Its a good idea to split a pasta meal and a salad with a friend; Then you get the best of both worlds."
1,"Okay, I want to like it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food. \n\nFirst, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place would be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish. \n\nFor lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit). \n\nFinally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups."
1,"I came here super excited since the Wynn has such a highly raved buffet of Vegas and from many satisfied friends. Though there was not a line when my boyfriend and I arrived, and plenty of tables all around, it took a good 30 minutes before we got seated. Alright, I'll let it slide this time. So got seated and ordered a pink lemonade mixed with Sprite because I was so thirsty from the desert heat. when I gulped up my first glass,m I headed towards the food. \n\nThe way I usually eat at buffets is I'll walk around the whole area, see what they got, then mentally divide and pair up which foods I'll get together in each trip. Started off with some pasta. I love me some pasta. I got the tortellini and noticed they had a made-to-order pasta station. Oooooooh! There was a line so I decided to come back. Let's just say that tortellini and the cocktail shrimps were the best of the entire buffet. The ravioli I got at the pasta station after tasted like shit. They only had 2 soup choices where other buffets have at least 4. The corn on the cob was so soggy and greasy. The selection at the Wynn buffet is so minimal. There wasn't much to eat. \n\nNot to mention that the plates weren't all fully cleaned. I came across two plates my entire meal that had specks of sauce on it still. I left still hungry. I should have went to Bellagio."
1,The sushi was just ok and the ginger dressing was too sweet and not very ginger like. Not good enough for the price.
0,"Grenzwertige Erfahrung:\nPositiv fand ich, das man sich quasi seinen Wunschburger zusammenbauen kann und die recht gute Lage in der Innenstadt, eigentlich keine Schlechte Alternative zu McDonalds und Co die in der Stadt. Die Einrichtung ist sehr schick,auch wenn mir das Pers\u00f6nlich nicht zum Burger essen nicht wirklich passt.Ist aber Ansichtssache.\nGeschmacklich sind die Burger in Ordnung,mehr aber auch nicht. \u00c4ndert auch nichts dran das es Bio ist(ok,die Jalapenos waren sehr gut,aber das wars auch.). Das Fleisch war bei meinen letzten Besuchen innen immer rot. Auf Nachfrage hie\u00df es,es w\u00e4re so Absicht. Naja bin da etwas anderer Meinung mit rohem Hackfleischmein Magen hat sich an dem Abend bedankt. Die Pommes sind f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack zu lasch und hart gewesen. Preislich f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack zu hoch,Preis-Leistung stimmt leider nicht.\nWerde mal in ferner Zukunft vielleicht mal wieder reinschauen, in der Hoffnung das es bis dahin besser geworden ist mit dem rohen Fleisch,will nicht nochmal so viel bezahlen um wieder die halbe Nacht auf der Toilette zu verbringen.\n(Wenn ich richtig informiert bin,ist es nicht zul\u00e4ssig Hackfleisch medium in der Gastronomie zu verkaufen.)"
1,"Not amused. It's an okay show, but actually, I was quite bored. I've seen other Cirque shows and this has to be at the bottom of my list along with Zumanity."
2,"Only reason why we went here was because we walked the strip and realized it was best to eat before getting ready for the club but we didn't have time to wait in line anywhere else. So harrahs it was, food is ok here. Not much of a selection and for some reason just taste more dry compared to other buffets. Gave it 3 stars because the service was good there. Very attentive to our needs which was nice. The best thing here was probably their dessert bar, it looked good and clean!"
1,"So I must be crazy, because every time I see a groupon for this place, I buy it.... I think my memories and actual experiences do not line up. So I had yet another deal for this place, and I decided to go there with the BF for lunch today to celebrate end of school. The place was fairly empty, but the decor is still nice. I ended up ordering the bhan mi sandwich at the suggestion of the waitress and the BF got the turkey sandwich. We both got the side of the day which was a sweet potato corn bread with honey and fruit butter. So the sandwiches come out and I was a bit confused. On the menu it said that the bhan mi was roasted pork with carrots, cilantro, cucumber, and a sriracha mayo. Well.... this sandwich was not roasted pork. It was strips of ham... like deli ham. WTF? This sandwich costs $10.50. I could go buy some deli meat and veggies and throw it in a pan for 5 seconds for about 2$. I don't even like ham and would never order a ham sandwich. Isn't this restaurant supposed to be all about freshness and organic and whatnot? Because deli ham is anything but.... Why can America's tacos sell delicious roasted pork for about 2$ and this place doesn't even really use roasted pork? In addition, I was about half done with the first half of the sandwich and I found a whole slice of jalapeno in my mouth. My mouth was on fire. I couldn't eat anymore of the sandwich. My eyes were watering.... and I like spicy and use jalapenos in a lot of my cooking. Ugh. I liked the turkey sandwich, but on the menu it states that it comes with bacon.... well no bacon. Really center bistro? Why have a menu when apparently you just put whatever you feel like putting in the food? The corn bread was good and the butter that came with it was good too, but I felt extremely ripped off by my meal there today.... it was unacceptable. \n\nI find myself wondering if their breakfast or newly added dinners would be better, as the dinner menu looks good, but I'm, worried if I go for something on said menu, I'll just get some random other thing that I did not want. So we'll see if I give it another go."
1,"This airport has few choices and we decided upon this location as they were busy but there was no wait.  We were seated quickly but then it took forever for anyone to approach us regards our order.  Good thing we had the time waiting on our flight as the service continued to be very slow and forget needing a drink refill.  The lettuce on the burger was 25% brown, fries cold and bun stale.  Not impressed with the food nor the service.  The airport needs other choices as I wouldn't eat here again."
0,Heard a lot of good things about baby stacks.  one opened on my end of town so decided to give it a go.  \n\nsat quickly and waited a good 10 minutes for water and coffee/tea order.  another 10 to get the drinks.\n\nfood took a whI would like to say the food sat under the heat lamp way too long and was overly dry when it was delivered.  not the case.  it sat somewhere for too long and was delivered cold.\n\nour waitress was great and took everything back and removed the meals from our check.  the kick in the pants is that I still received a bill for one cup of coffee.  kinda bush league...
4,"I've been here a few times and the place is great! Huge portions, reasonably priced and tastes very authentic! I will definitely be coming back."
1,"There are only 2 reasons I come here - okay, one big reason - Shellane! She is the best hair stylist I have ever had. I have never once had to bring a picture of what I want. During our first appointment she asked me a lot of questions about my morning routine, did I use product or not? Do I want to use product? How much time do I have to spend on my hair? etc. She then created this gorgeous look that I was able to recreate perfectly again and again afterwards. Every time I see her, I am soooo happy  with the results - she gets me. She is very hard to book, so if you are lucky enough to get her - make sure you book your next appointment right away and don't miss it (more on that later)!\n\nThat being said, this isn't a review on Shellane, it's a review of Ulta. This particular Ulta's customer service SUCKS! When you call the salon nobody EVER answers. I tried at least 5 times over a couple of weeks to book my appointment and nobody ever answered the phone. So I went in-store to book my appointment with Shellane. I waited for 5 minutes at the counter and nobody came to help me. I figured maybe the receptionist got pulled away for a minute, so I walked around the store for a few other items I needed. I came back, waited another 5 minutes and still nobody showed up. I had to go to the front counter and complain to get someone to help me. \n\nI missed one appointment with Shellane and it took me a month and a half to reschedule (after trying to call several times and going in-store I finally got an appointment). \n\nAlso, there is nobody on the floor to help you shop for products and if you're lucky enough to catch someone as they're speed walking from the front to the back, they have no knowledge of the products!\n\nHonestly, if Shellane wasn't the best hairdresser I've ever had - I would have started shopping elsewhere months ago! \n\nOh and if you're wondering what the second reason was - They (meaning corporate Ulta) have a pretty cool rewards program."
3,Went back for a second time to get the Irish coffee on a cold late afternoon.  The place was empty and there for the service was great.   The bartender was engaging and extremely knowledgeable about whiskey and even gave us some pointers about how to have a better experience and enjoy the whiskey properly.   The place itself is small  but let's not forget that it is inside a sea container but the patio during the afternoon is delightful and make a great perch to watch the playground.   The Boozery is the ONLY BAR IN LAS VEGAS that serves products from our very own Las Vegas Distillery!!!      So go enjoy this unique bar in the very unique setting of container park....
1,It was OK. A Mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy! Food was average at best. Service was good and the strawberry margarita was good but the food was not impressive.
1,"So, most of my reviews are going to be based on the quality and taste of the food.  I don't find that I experience really bad service or great service that often, most is satisfactory.  \nOn with the review.  The bread that they bring at the begining was pretty delicious, but sad when that was the best part of the meal.  Most of us had pasta, mine was extremely bland (I had the creamy garlic chicken)  I had to add a lot of salt and I never salt anything.  My fiance had the fresh tomato mozzarella pasta and it was terribly bland also, the tomatoes hardly even had taste.  The only thing in our group of six that seemed to be good was the chopped gorganzola salad. \nI would much rather support a local restaurant than a chain, but I would have to say that I would rather eat at Olive Garden than here."
3,"Sushi menu was great for my girlfriend and I and the burger menu was equally impressive.  The drink we ordered, however, seemed less enlightened and we asked that they correct the strange flavor of our alcoholic cocktail.  \n\nBig fish tank behind the bar makes this bar a perfect spot for a classy date or a serious drink, especially with it being walking distance to South Park Mall."
3,"This is the sketchy part of Vegas your mom warned you about, but it's also pretty fabulous. Aside from the overhead canopy lightshow, there is a collection of beautiful, old neon signs from long-gone casinos scattered up and down Fremont Street (obviously, go at night for the full effect).\n\nFremont Street is also great for getting comfortable playing the tables if you're new to them. Many, many moons ago I cut my teeth at Binion's $2 blackjack table - my friend and I were too intimidated to play the crowded tables on the strip, so we took a cab out to Fremont Street, where we got VIP treatment at Binion's (and finally rolled back home to the strip at dawn - a great time was had by all)..."
3,"Top Highlights and Lowlights\n\n1) super friendly and accommodating staff\n2) hotel is a little dated\n3) great location on the strip\n\nI stayed at the Paris hotel for a week for business. I booked a king standard room but when I arrived they were out of that room style so they gave me a room with two double beds and an Eiffel Tower view. I also had to leave about 15 items at the bell desk for co-workers and the staff was really accommodating. The view was great! The room wasn't anything super special and a little dated but nice overall with a pretty big bathroom. \n\nThere are a few good restaurants and bars in the hotel including Mon Ami Gabi and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. There is also a piano bar, Napoleans, that had some really talented pianists in the week I was there. There is also a club, Chateau here. The club is probably not a top club in Vegas but the view from the \""rooftop\"" deck is great and the DJs were great the few times I went.\n\nThe location of the hotel is great, it is in the middle of the strip so you can walk almost anywhere. The hotel is connected to Ballys so you can get to monorail station without having to walk outside. \n\nI really enjoyed my stay here! Less expensive than some of the other hotels on the strip but still good service and amenities."
0,"Visited with my family, 3/15/2012. Service was horrendously bad. Food was disgusting and  WAY overpriced. Over $140 for a lunch for five.\n\nAn establishment whose chef has appeared on Top Chef should be serving food that is, at the very minimum, edible. At best, the experience should be something I want to remember and enjoy. Unfortunately, not the case here.\n\nHow does one screw up a Caesar's salad? What the hell is a Caesar's salad doing on the menu at a MEXICAN restaurant, anyway?\n\nFurthermore, don't let me believe at the front door that I'm going to find Meican food on the menu, when in fact, you're serving Central and South American food, with no mention of any of the Mexican food standards.\n\nAll in all, a thoroughly unenjoyable, disappointing experience."
0,"I dont know why we keep trying this place except the location is convenient.  The wait staff is always rude (we have been re-trying this place for 5 years now, and after this morning we won't be back) Food is ok, and prices are high for a Dennys and they nickel and dime for everything. We shared a couple better establishments with our fellow Tahiti Village owners within walking distance, with great service and food and prices!"
2,It's ok. Prices or not cheaper than regular prices.
2,"This is my neighborhood Sprouts.  The one time manager of this store used to live downstairs from me and I had no clue what he did for a living until long after he accepted a position with another company.  After I found out what he did I mentioned I had only been in 2 Sprouts and had liked the produce in the first one I went to (83rd and T-Bird) but when the new one opened at 51st and Peoria, on my way home, I had been disappointed in the quality of the produce and had never gone back.  He explained you do not want to buy meat and produce from a place that does not have lines at the register because they do not turn the inventory fast enough.  He suggested I go a little out of my way and try his old store which does a much higher volume.  If I am in the area I will also still stop by 83rd and T-Bird as they do even more volume.  Some of their stuff is a little high priced but for price shopping I go to Wal-mart or Costco.\n\nSo what do I like to buy there?  Produce, pork brats, fish (Friday I got swordfish), several times a year they have buffalo, chocolate covered raisins (I really have to watch myself). They have Muir Glen ketchup (no corn syrup and great taste).  I have tried some of their breads and chips and not been impressed.\n\nI do not go often but I am glad I took my neighbor's advice and tried them again.  And I have never had more than 3 people in front of me in line."
3,"Usually come here on Friday nights with my friends who are regulars.\n\nFood is pretty solid the lamb meatballs and Johnny's nachos are very popular with our group. Even their ranch dressing is really good and I am not a big ranch fan. I also like the Guinness stew.\n\nThe only thing keeping this place from being a full 5 stars is that it's probably a bit on the pricy side for what it is. Beers start at $6 (i think I haven't had one cheaper) and pretty much any food item is $10+ with sandwiches at $12. Shave a couple bucks off and they would be in solid 5 star contention.\n\nThe service here is also good as all the servers are friendly, keep up well with groups and splitting checks (always hard since our group can be anywhere from 4-12), and they are willing to joke around with us and not throw us out (always a possibility with our non-pc humor and discussions)."
1,"Let me preface this by saying it's not a terrible show, and would be great for taking an entire family to (if you can afford it). It's like many things in Vegas, and is way overpriced for what it is.\n\nFirst, some of the acrobatics were great, of course, but nothing I haven't seen at significantly cheaper carnivals and other shows. Sure, they had lots of energy, and I know it's a lot of work, but there wasn't a whole lot of actual talent, which is what I expected to see; this is Vegas, this is supposed to be top-shelf talent, and you can't even get some peopel who can actually shoot a bow and arrow?\n\nIt's a very 'busy' show, so I think for many that's all it needs to be in order to be entertained, but if you focused on the individuals, most weren't really doing much. Wow, you can play catch (and drop it a few times), not very impressive. \n\nThe story was kinda hacky, and the performers themselves aren't mic'd so its like watching a TV show in the Sims 3: cheezy, pointless, and lots of gibberish. The fat lady was completely unnecessary; we get it, fat people are helpless and should be laughed at, but come on, it's an ongoing joke throughout the entire show.\n\nAs for the show's storyline, it basically involved the fat lady matriach of a clan, two men-women (women dressed as men) fall in love to quell the spat between two lands, and pirate dudes crash the party and capture one of the man-woman. King of the pirates wants his daughter to marry, then the Fu-manchu dude presents his emo son to said daughter. Emo dude's special talents include whipping his hair back and amateur pyrotechnics, emo dude then gives the daughter a baton they pretend is a flute for some reason. Some bullshit goes on with some of the original tribes being lost, pointlessly annoying giant bugs and crabs pop up on the beach and take up 20 minutes of time for some stupid reason. Pirate king's daughter falls in love with the man-woman, and gives him the flute-baton for some reason. He plays it for a minute. She then does a baton routine with said flute (which was pretty decent actually). Eventually, the two men-women are reunited, fu manchu dude had a plan to take over all the tribes, some 'war' footage is displayed in terrible quality, then they do a happy dance. Oh, then they'll do real fireworks, which sounds cool, but super bright white light in a pitch-black theatre does what? Oh yeah, it freaking blinds you, so you can't even see it. So f*cking stupid.\n\nAs for the actual good parts in the show, the platform was pretty awesome and took some creative engineering. There were hints of actual talent with the baton routine, the hamster cages (you'll see), and the sparkling dude on the corde lisse, and the sets were designed pretty well. But it was also kinda amateurish, I've seen much more impressive acrobatics done by far cheaper acts, and the focus on a lot of stupid bs like the crab and giant centipede, that took up like over 10 minutes of pointlessness, totally made for any 5 year olds in the audience I suppose.\n\nWe got pretty decent deals ($100/ea, nicely-centered seats in the middle of the arena which are definintely the best seats in the house), but still feel like it was a waste of money."
2,A little bit above the average Thai place you go to for lunch. The food is four stars but the service is a one and a half. Try the Lemongrass chicken. Grilled marinated chicken with a sweet peanut sauce. Honestly one of the best chicken dishes I've had. Even though it's not traditional I suggest you give it a try.
1,"I've been to so many airports over the years that I can't even name them all. In the morning, this airport is certainly quiet. But it's also dead. I came in on a red eye. By 6, almost nothing in the D terminal is open. And the one sit down restaurant that is open has no outlets. While it's nice to have charging stations by the gates, travelers who work like to sit down and enjoy their meal while banging out some work and charging their equip. More restaurants with outlets and open before 7 for early travelers would go a long way to improving this place."
1,"Hmm, had a not so good experience.\nProbably not going back. \n\nWell, I guess even the coolest places have to have growing pains.\nOh, and the music sucks now. The now have two boys that sound exactly alike.\n\nEven more offensive, one of the guitarists was smoking near my table as he was \""setting up\""."
3,"So they just got done redoing this place and it looks way better. It has a restaurant portion and a bar area. This is a great place to enjoy a Finger Cordon Bleu. It's a chicken served up to whatever hotness you want and topped with swiss cheese, ham served on a toasted bun, served up with some fat fries. \n\nMy suggestion get it hot, with cheddar cheese instead of swiss and forget the ham and ask them to serve it up with some onion rings instead. It is awesome, they have a lot of repeat customers, cause the server knows a lot of the names of the people dining and the customers know the servers name. You cant beat that. \n\nThe menu is your common all american menu with steak, burgers, sandwiches and some pasta."
2,"Well, it is a regular mall with regular stores, however it was my first time in a Clinique store, since when did they have their own store?! Only in Vegas, I suppose. \nIt has a nice facade, big silver and round button-like decor, very shiny, very Vegas-Hollywood, after all, it is next to Planet Hollywood Hotel.\nOverall 3.5 stars since I found what I was looking for, to heal my chapped lips. \n\nFYI Saw the billboard that H&M opened their doors in this mall last Thurs, Oct 4."
1,Very disappointed!Heard so much about this place so we were very surprised! Walked in and immediately greeted... Very good service.\nThe place was dead!!! It was after 9 so drinks weren't on special.. But 8 for a corona!? No thanks!
3,"Everything was excellent. Started with the Buffalo Blast appetizer! Amazing! The pizza and soup,were both good and of course the cheesecake was outstanding. The service was excellent and we waited less than 5 minutes to get in. The only problem I had with it (as seems to be the case with many restaurants in Vegas) is actually finding it."
1,"I went here when I dropped my iPhone (tragedy...) and broke the speaker. I could hear my callers, but they couldn't hear me. I went in to Best Buy to see if I could just buy one of those cheap pay-as-you-go phones, because I had some urgent business calls to make, and had planned to be running around town all day. I looked around with a customer service rep, who was in fact friendly. But after some wasted time, we came to the conclusion that they had nothing to offer me.  In short, I have no problem with the customer service at this location. But I wish such a big chain would not forget to supply their stores with the simple/affordable options. This could be my old fashioned preference, but if I want to by a non-color screen flip phone, I'd hope I could find it at one of the biggest electronic stores in the nation."
0,Worst food I've tasted since 1995. Service was terrible and the filet mignon was cardboard. Very disappointed. Will never return
3,"Express hand car wash for $7? Sign me up! There are some fancier options such as wax, vacuuming, etc. but I can do those at home.\n\nThe only downside here was trying to figure out how to get in. It's stuck behind a gas station and when I drove up, there were two employees just standing around staring at me. I pulled up right next to them and asked for service. I would have expected someone to walk up to my window or at least wave and indicate what to do to get my car washed.\n\nAfter handing over my $7, I pulled up to what looked like an automated car wash with a track that pulls the car along. The only automated part involved a gentle rinse, soap and dryer. A few workers followed the car along and cleaned it. I didn't even have to get out of the car!\n\nOverall, the value is great. I will definitely go back!"
4,Fantastic service!  The entire staff makes you feel special and happy to be there.  The steaks are great.  Cooked exactly to order and the best cuts and quality of meat.  A far better value than going to the Strip.  We will definitely going back!
4,"Not a place you can judge by its location or ambience - you just have to eat the food! Delicious and unique - not getting these dishes anywhere else in Madison. When we moved on to dessert, the chef brought us out 2 piping hot leaves filled with sticky, sweet rice (wish I knew the names of these dishes...) The host was very friendly and answered all questions we had. We look forward to returning for more!"
3,"I've had my eye on Samosa Factory for some time, but finally got around to trying it last night when our first choice for dinner was closed for the holiday. \n\nWe entered the small dining area and were greeted by the incredibly friendly server. We told him we wanted to order our food to-go and he still offered us two glasses of water and a starter to nibble on while we perused the menu. We settled on the Lamb Vindaloo and the Chicken Tikka Masala. We also ordered some garlic naan. Our server was incredibly personable and offered us refills on our water while we waited as well as made some idle chit chat with us. \n\nOnce our food arrived, we paid our bill and off we went with our food. The server also offered us a to-go menu for our return visit. Great customer service!\n\nMy fella and I dug into our meal as soon as we got home. The spice level was just right. We ordered the medium spice level to be on the safe side on our first visit. The garlic naan was delicious and I really enjoyed the rice. The flavors were right on and I look forward to a return visit to hopefully eat in the restaurant and try some of their samosas. The food is not cheap, but I didn't feel it was overly expensive for the quantity and quality of food we got.\n\nDefinitely a great Indian option in a town that is lacking."
3,"I am a Chicago boy, bred and raised on Italian beefs.  Johnny's, Bouna Beef, Portillos and a slew of mom and pop shops.  \n\nHaving just moved to Phoenix, I thought I would have to suffer a bit without my regular fix of Italian beef, wet and hot.  I am pleased to say, I found a highly acceptable solution here in town, mere miles from my house.\n\nThe beef and sausage were dead on, the jus was great, the hot gairdinera (sp?) (Vienna) was exactly what I wanted.  Ok, the bread is not perfect, it lacks something, it is not Turano from Chicago.  Even the fries (skin on) were very good.\n\nTo top off the experience, the interior decor is a great shout out to my kind of town.  Familiar street signs, skyline views and even a Chicago rock radio station playing in the background made for a wonderful, homesick lunch.\n\nOnly negative - I had a cannoli that was only slightly filled at the ends and hollow in the middle - Not cool.\n\nI will soon be a regular and ultimately the duke of Joey's.  \n\n\nPS: last plus - I didn't have to climb over mounds of snow and slush to get into the shop."
1,"It's a good thing they have super good sales on their meat and fish because otherwise I would never come here. \n\nTheir produce is only so so.  I buy milk a lot here because it seems to be on sale every week. And then the meat and fish - they normally have some sort of buy one, get one or buy one, get two deal on something. And you can't pass that up. \n\nThe service here completely sucks though. The cashiers and probably the least friendly people on the face of the earth. They don't even acknowledge you half the time. And they are all so ssslllooowww. It takes three times as long to check out at this store then any other store I go to. \n\nI will continue to look at their ads and come when they have good sales. But I'm so glad this doesn't have to be my only option for groceries!"
0,not worth the cost of the plate! paid 38$ for a chicken on a plate. no sauce and the vegtables were put on a side plate to share amongst 5 people! i was shocked!. high prices for no reason and waited forever to get served.
0,"I wish I could give this place negative stars. We were lured in late night on a Friday and were told that the cover would allow me free drinks and my boyfriend one drink ticket. The second we walked in  we regretted it. This place is a total joke. It smelled terrible and the floor was sticky in a lot of areas. \nAfter we got our first drinks we hung out on the edge of the sorry excuse for a dance floor. There was a couple dancing near us and the gentleman was evidentially sharing his gf's drink- girls had to have red cups- and a bouncer came  by and told him that  he was absolutely not allowed to drink out of the female cups. He then proceeded to purposely slam the cup from the guy's hands to the floor. We were close by and I was the lucky lady who had that drink spilled all over my feet. The bouncer looked at the liquid on the floor and my shoes, said nothing, and walked away. \nWe decided to leave at that point but wanted to get me one more drink since we basically paid $40 for only two at that point. I got a watery vodka cranberry and we walked to the balcony to drink it and leave. I had my bf take a sip of my beverage so he could taste how watery it was, and lo and behold the same A-hole  bouncer came out and proceeded to yell-yes, yell- at my bf for drinking out of my red cup. \nWe got the hell out of there at that point. Don't go here if you want a good time."
3,"I am from Los Angeles, and this place is the closest to quality of LA. Mexican food I've found."
4,"This is a wonderful barre studio.  I got hooked on barre at the Village, but (at least when I was a member) there were only two classes a week!  Karve has several classes a day - enough that there is no excuse for skipping.  It also helps that Karve is right next door to Daydreams so someone can watch the little ones for me too. Flexible schedule and babysitting - there go my excuses.  \n\nEvery single instructor is wonderful, challenging, upbeat and professional.  The staff here is just incredible. They really really know what they are doing AND there is usually at least one other instructor in the class actually taking the class.  Got to admit - I like it that the instructors take the classes too and that they also shake and struggle through thigh work!  I appreciate that there is a \""formula\"" to the class, but that even after about 50 classes, I have not been bored.  \n\nAnd finally, I really like the other women that go to Karve.  It is a beautiful place to spend an hour."
3,"I was a little hesitant to try this place, as it hasn't really been reviewed well. However, I'm glad I trusted my gut (not the hungry part, the sensible part)!\n\nWhen I walked in, the dining room was absolutely packed! Obviously, it's a popular destination. So, I took a minute to see what looked best to me. After a few minutes perusing their menu, I opted for the Shrimp Burrito. The young lady behind the counter informed me that it would take about five minutes for my order to be ready. So, I took my drink to the dining room and waited.\n\nAs I was waiting, I passed by their full bar. I wasn't really in the market for an alcoholic beverage during lunch, so I didn't really price anything. The fact that this bar exists, though...that's the important thing! The self-serve chips and salsa bar was really cool! It's similar to ones that you would find at Baja Fresh, except for the endless chips. That's a pretty nice touch, in my opinion.\n\nAfter about five minutes (a touch longer, but I wasn't in a hurry), my burrito was ready. Size wise, my burrito was comparable to ones that you find at Chipotle or Qdoba. However, the difference maker for me was the actual content. I made sure to pay extra close attention to the amount of shrimp contained in my burrito. I've been burned at places before when they skimped on contents. Not here. EVERY single bite I took was accompanied by a full shrimp...and I don't take small bites. For $8.85, I was definitely impressed. \n\nIf you're in the market for a sort of change of pace with regards to your Mexican food, you should check out Blue Burrito Grille. If you need more incentive, they do have a couple of televisions, free Wi-Fi, and a nice patio. The patio is covered by umbrellas, but it doesn't have misters or anything like that. So, if you want to sit outside, make sure you get in on the action before it gets hot!"
4,"You can feel Michael during the entire show. It's breathtaking, overwhelming at times and tastefully done. The theater is beautiful and would recommend sitting on section 203 row AA to see everything from a perfect spot - just watch out for the zombies! I've seen Love and thought that was an amazing show, I love Michael so this was such a treat. Previews were great, can't wait to see this show again later this year. Smooth Criminal, Man in the Mirror, Thriller and Beat It were my top favorites. But the whole show was entertaining and something to take in. Love you MJ! Cirque did him justice :)"
1,"I have been going to The Joint for 3 months now. I like that they are open on the weekends, which is why I decided to try it over a traditional chiropractor. I've been worked on by 3 different people here. While I generally feel better right after getting adjusted, it isn't lasting. I also don't feel like they are very thorough here. I've been telling them there's a spot on my back that's been bothering me for a couple months now. The guy today cracked my neck, then popped my back (left and right) and that was it. Really? I can do that myself at home! What's the point? I also didn't like that I smelled like the guy when I got home and had to change my shirt, but the smell was still in my hair. :( I'm going to try a different location and see if they actually listen to me and do a proper job. I know they don't do appointments, but one thing I wish they did was online check-in (like Great Clips has) to minimize the wait time."
2,"I have always liked Payless. It probably started growing up, as my parents were not well off. And, this was were most of my shoes came from. I have tried the $200 shoes... they last just as long. How long something lasts depends on how well you take care of it!\n\nAs for this particular store (and the rating). The service is OK...not great. I had to ask for help - I was the only one in the store, so this was a little uncalled for! Easp whe there was 2 workers in the store.\n\nAlso, when checking out - the phone rang and the lady assisting me answered the phone?  Seemed a little rude, esp when the other person could of answered the phone."
4,"Ah, a bit of Deutschland here in USA. Beer is good (duh), food it depends on what you order. I was born in Germany and raised off schnitzels and wursts so I may be overcritical on some of their items, but the weiss wurst and sauerbraten are pretty good. What makes this place a great hang out for me is the biergarten .... 1. Awesome view 2. Lots of seats 3. Bathrooms close (lots of beer = lots of trips) 3. I can smoke cigars 4. great scenery. \n\nInside is load with music and people dancing. Always amusing to watch and take in the atmosphere. I plan on spending time here for the World Cup for sure."
1,"Seriously!!!  I would never ever pay $50.00 for a pedicure EVER.. Well again and I wouldn't have paid it this time NEITHER.  We asked for pricing, I stated what I wanted  and the only change i made from time of check in to done was that I now wanted french tips.  Had I wanted to spend this kind of money, i would have gone to TheBathHouse.\n\nthe other thing that puzzled me was \""why, were they mopping the floor at 9 am in the morning, when the salon JUST opened\""  Who really wants to be at a Salon when they are cleaning up yesterday mess."
1,This buffet was not really that good. Me and my buddy went to eat here prior to hitting the town. We get there and it was pretty empty. Maybe about five more guests were eating here. \n\nThe selection was the smallest I have ever seen in Vegas. They tried to have every international flavor there is but it would only be one or two main courses. \n\nA buffet would not be a buffet without Prime Rib. The Prime Rib here was ehh. It did not seem like the middle pieces had any sort of flavor. It was juicy but not tasty. \n\nI would not recommend going to this buffet. You can definitely find a better buffet in Vegas than this.
3,"I will start with a tip. It has a great parking lot. You can access it from either Koval or Tropicana; basically what I am saying is parking on the strip with out having to drive on the strip! Now to the hotel itself, the last time I stayed here the room was great, a good size and quite clean! If go during pool season, they have a wide variety of pool areas from the raucous to the serene to the family friendly. They also have plenty of restaurants of all types from the very casual to high end. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"
0,I've been to this place a few time but most recently it has gone completely down hill and beyond help.  This was never the place to go for good service but more for game and fun atmosphere.   Last few time not only has it become horrible service but rude service at that.  Specially this ugly rude girl that called herself the manager.  I order some fried zucchini off there late nite menu and after 45min it still hasn't come and when I asked about how much long she rudely said that it will come when it comes and that they only have one fryer for the whole bar.   Let's just say that will be my last time going to this establishment.
3,"Great Schtick, as a previous reviewer wrote. I don't remember much about the food, frankly (I seem to remember enjoying the onion rings) so it probably wasn't fantastic. But the experience of eating made the visit worth it."
4,"I've lived in Tempe for over thirteen years and have been ordering pizzas from this location since moving to Tempe from Ahwatukee. I've never had a bad pizza from the Ahwatukee location (Lived there 6 months.) nor the Tempe location. On average we order Rosati's pizza from this location at least every 3 weeks or so. We save the coupons from the boxes so we've had a lot of pizzas for half off over the 13 years of being a customer of the Tempe location. Our favorite pizza has been the Gonzo (Pepperoni, spinach, green olives.), we are currently ordering double pepperoni, double spinach, onions and black olives. Same quality for over 13 years. And no I have not received any compensation for this review - just wanted to submit an honest review."
2,You see this place in many airports but this one didn't have the freshest food.  The cinnamon roll was drier but still delicious.  I assume they bring everything in from somewhere else as it is too small looking to cook pastries.  Still I am coming back as I liked their coffee with rolls.
3,I stayed here on an off-night and it was only around 40 bucks. Loved the room we had with the view and the hot tub. Both the exterior and interior of this hotel/casino are really cool looking. Criss Angel's show is here and it's a fun one to watch. No real complaints.
2,"Headed here after seeing a movie at the Harkins located inside the same mall. We were interested in checking out the menu first since we weren't sure if this one had the same offerings we were used to from the Orlando location we went to from time to time.  \n\nAfter looking over the menu we decided that we could all find something we wanted to eat here and we were brought a few more menus after a bit. I ordered the Cobb Salad, he had the Turkey BLT Club and our friend had the Quesadilla. The Cobb Salad had a lot of toppings on it and it was well-made, but it was really covered in dressing to a point that it was all you tasted. If we ever go back, I'll definitely request that on the side.\n\nThe Club sandwich my husband had was sandwiched with bread that was toasted to a point it wasn't really edible, so he took everything out of it and at that, which kinda defeats the purpose of a sandwich altogether. The insides of the Club were fresh and tasty though and the fries that came with it were good as well.  \n\nTook awhile to get things from our waitress during almost every step of the meal. Which seemed a little odd considering we went during an off time and it wasn't too busy.\n\nOverall: B-\nProbably wouldn't recommend it to people with all the other options in the food court just around the corner...but not a bad place if you are looking to entertain little ones."
0,Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center!
0,I am not a picky eater but everything here is so bland and boring. The spinach dip was watery and tasted weird. My pasta needed tons of salt and pepper because it tasted like a Michelina's frozen dinner.  The prices are pretty cheap but you can go elsewhere for food that tastes much better for the same price.
2,"Let me preface this by saying I have only ever ordered from their food card or delivery. And that I consistently hear good things about this place from people I know in the food industry. And they seem like really nice folks. And so please take this with that grain of salt. \n\nI've tried, Banzo. I really did. I want to like you. I hear you are great. But you keep letting me down. Did I do something wrong?  The falafel was rock hard and dry once, and burnt the next time. The tabouli was horribly unbalanced and swimming in oil. The tsatziki was bland, and the tahini was.. salty? I think I have caught these guys on bad days.  \n\nBut the staff is super nice, the prices are reasonable, and it smells amazing. I can tell my falafel would have been delicious if it was not stale/burnt. I think perhaps this is a gem where you should not order it delivery, and stick to the restaurant rather than the cart."
4,"This time I enjoyed my experience even more than last!  Skinny skin-on fries were very tasty.  My Vienna Premium Beef Chicago Dog on a soft and steamed Vienna Poppy Seed Bun was authentic and delicious.  And, my 3\"" Italian Beef Sandwich with sweet peppers on a Gonnella Italian Style Roll that had been drenched in Au Jus was simply great with and without Giardiniera.  Again I got the most bang for my buck by ordering the #4 Windy City's Best of Both Worlds.  Especially for dinner, it would be a shame to only consume one sandwich or dog here, in any event!  \n\nThe proprietors, who are hands-on owners, were very friendly, and service was first-rate.  Ambiance is Windy City Chicago sports all the way, with great-tasting Chi-Town comfort food."
1,Food is okay but a Lil overpriced.  How do you go from 6.99 sandwich to adding $5 more for fries and a drink?  I could've got a crispy chicken sandwich from jack in the box and still be satisfied.
1,"I've said it before - chains exist so that people know what to expect as far as consistency goes. \n\nThat being said - I've been to the Famous Dave's in Long Beach and I actually enjoyed my meal - both the service and the food. I wish I could say the same about my experience at the North Las Vegas location. \n\nService - our server was around when she needed to be. At least in her opinion that is. She took our order. Brought out drinks, our order, the bill and my change. Otherwise, looking for her was like playing the game - \""Where's Waldo?\"" At least she was friendly. I'll give her that much. \n\nAs for the food - my family ordered the Feast and it came out so fast that it explained why the food wasn't very good. Warm it up and serve it up must be their motto. The meat selections were all dry. Of the ribs, the brisket, the chicken, fries and corn, I like the fries the best. That's saying a lot considering I'm a carnivore and I love my dead, cooked animal meat. \n\nComparing notes of my two experiences at Famous Dave's - I have to suggest that lunch is better than dinner. It stands to reason that lunch will be fresher while dinner will be the meats prepared earlier in the day to be able to serve the evening crowd faster. Either that or the North Las Vegas location is just that bad. One day I may get around to testing this feeling ..."
0,"I haven't been to the buffet at the Bellagio since 2000.  I have many fond memories of eating there 14+ years ago and thought it was time to go back.  What a mistake.\n\nMost of the food is low quality.  None of the prep staff in the kitchen knew of the specific ingredients in any of the food (I have a few intolerances... corn, soy, etc.), and many of them couldn't even speak English so I had a hard time figuring out what I could eat.  This has never been an issue at places like Aria Buffet, Bacchanal Buffet, or Paris Buffet (all of which are exponentially better than the Bellagio).\n\nI was so disappointed. This is the first time leaving a buffet hungry because I just couldn't risk eating food that I couldn't get ingredient info on."
4,"In the East Valley, this is the best spot to get you BBQ meats! They always have the best selection, always great quality. It isn't going to be the best prices in the valley BUT you pay for quality!! The Tailgater package is your best bet- hot dogs, burgers, brats, buns AND a small bag of the BEST pretzels ever!! They mist them in light oil and then roll them in dry seasonings_ WOW goes great with beer! Oh ya- they have a nice selection of beer and wines. TODAY- tried the green chili cheese brats... fantastic!!"
4,Amazing food! Amazing ambiance! Excellent service. The GM came to talk with us and everything! Everyone come check out this new restaurant!
0,"You guys are too kind.  MacRae's review was on the mark but conceded one too many stars.\n\nThis is 1985.  Old, ugly, worn out, and dirty.  Time to replace the carpet and the furniture, y'all.\n\nIn 1985 no one had laptops, phones, kindles, and notebooks to charge.  In 2013 they do, and \""Sky Harbor\"" hasn't adapted. Does the general manager ever wonder why people are sitting on the floor by the wall outlets.  There was one charging station that I saw, but it didn't work.\n\nDid I mention that the waiting areas at the gates weren't large enough for the number of people on the flight?\n\nThere is free WiFi.  And unlike SD, there is more than one runway."
0,"Pimperial Phallus\n\nGot stuck with this joint after putting a bid in for a 3 star hotel in the center of the strip on Hotwire. Where to start? Parking here is horrible. The casino floor has got to be the saddest casino floor on the strip. The \""dealertainers\"" looked burnt out. There was a woman dealer with jerry curls, a glove on one hand, and would scream out , \""heee heeee!\"" everytime she busted. Which star is she supposed to be I thought to myself. I later woke up in the middle of the night with a eureka moment figuring out that she was Micheal Jackson.\n\nThe Friday evening check-in was horrible. We waited in line for 40 minutes to check-in. We got stuck with one bed since we booked through Hotwire. Our room was dingy. The shower drain was backed up. Did not bother to check out any of the food places. The feng-shui is just off. Do yourself a favor...pay a little more and stay away from the Pimperial Phallus."
1,"So, I gave it another try last week and I think it was worse than the first time. The service was better but the food --- if you're feeling low on sodium then head on over to The Grind. It's PURE SALT. My mouth was still salavating from the sodium overload hours later. Yuck. Plus, the burgers are these TOWERS... okay, so its impressive presentation for two minutes but then you try to eat them and its frankly just a pain in the arse. My advice - go to The Grind for wings, fries & beers at the bar but skip the burgers or any other food. Two burgers, fries, 1 beer, 2 glasses of wine = $65 salty meal that leaves you unsatisfied and craving Zin Burger or Delux."
1,"This is probably the WORST einsteins ive ever been to and it sucks to write this because I am a huge fan of them. But the one on campus always gets my order wrong, the bagels are not fluffy and theyre tasteless and the staff are slow. Not going back to that one ever again"
0,"Been a big fan of this restaurant since I moved to Vegas in 2010. Even though the service was not the best, I was able to overcome that with the food. It's very unfortunate to say that I finally have to say no to this restaurant!!! Made a reservation for dinner, party of 8 for my mom'a birthday. When we showed up the restaurant was full, and apparently they forgot about our reservation. We waited for almost 15 minutes, no one came to apologize for the mess up, and what really pissed me off and finally decided to walk out of the restaurant is when I told the the owner about what happened, he replied and said regardless if we made a reservation or not, they are too busy, if they don't have a table ready for us, we just have to wait! In my mind: \""&@&!/'\u00a3\u20ac]\"" this is definitely not the kind of reply to any guests at any restaurant!! How rude and  arrogant, not to mention I coordinate our company dinner at this restaurant once a month and spent over $300-$400 each time and the owner recognized who I am. Apparently this restaurant is careless for any customer service or loyalty guests!! There's a new Yun Nan restaurant at the 99 ranch plaza one block away, for those who also had experienced the \""customer service\"", I heard this new place is not too bad, will check it out!"
0,"Holy smokes does this place suck.\n\nI was told by someone that is was like Chipolte, only better. THEM is fighting words, so of course I had to check it out.\n\nI dragged two co-workers of mine over there, and I got a carne asada burro, side of chips and guacamole. The service was ok, not too friendly, and didn't try too hard. That's ok, it isn't fine dining. The prices were higher than Chipolte, so maybe the flavors were better?\n\nGetting back to the office we started in on this lunch. The best way to describe it, is space food. They say that in space food doesn't have flavor, so on the bright side, for the cost of lunch it was like being in space. The carne asada had ZERO flavor. The guac had no salt, garlic, nada. Just avacado. So weird? The rice in the burro had no flavor either, I don't know if the food was props for movies, or what?\n\nSkip this place, go a mile down the road for Chipolte, or head just West to America's Tacos."
3,Cracked Screen:\n\nI was so glad I found these guys - Greg was nice and is extremely knowledgeable.  If (hoping not) my screen ever cracks again I will definitely go to them first.  It's better than paying the $100 deductible and waiting for a refurbished phone to be shipped that the insurance I pay for every month charges......Insurance CANCELLED.....Thanks again for all your guys' help and if anyone needs anything repaired (including computers) - this is the place to take your stuff~
1,"I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the chili cheese fries. Otherwise, my burger was dry and seemed to be one of those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. Gross. My husband's pulled pork sandwich was dry and not enough sauce. Not to mention that the service was sad. Will never return, even if I was staying at the Flamingo."
0,"Worst McDonald's ever. They will make you wait in the \""Reserved Drive-Thru Parking\"" every time. What's the point of a Fast Food Drive-Thru when you have to pull over and wait afterward? This has always been an issue with THIS particular location. Supposedly, as legend has it, you are being made to wait in the reserved area so they can prepare 'fresh' food....as car after car after car behind you drive-thru and patrons receive their food with ease? Think about it this way...when was the last time you could remember noticing a special waiting area at the drive-thru at McDonald's? Exactly, they aren't built in to all the stores. The fact that this McDonald's has multiple drive-thru waiting areas should be a huge red flag to anyone in a hurry. Keep driving, there's a better McDonald's just a little further down the road on Alma School and Guadalupe."
2,"Open till late and food is ok but the ambience is great...AWESOME FOR A MID-NIGHT DRINK\n\nSo! Dont roll your eyes when your read what's next. I wanna go to this place again to check out the \""TOTO.\"" (If u don't know, I ain't telling).  The food is not gonna be heavenly but it s fine for a sushi dinner. Love the Sake carafes! (might have had 2, all by myself) Great place to go with a bunch of friends and could be a potential douche bag hang-out depending on what time of the night. Food is a little overpriced but who cares about food when you are drunk. \n\nIt gets a half-extra star (so technically 3.5 stars) for the late hours"
3,After my last Popeye's visit on Rainbow caused my daughter and I to get grossed out I've been searching for a replacement store. \n\nI think I found it; its on my way home from work. Its down the road from a grocery store I don't mind shopping at and even though its attached to a gas station its an easy in and out.\n\nKeep it up and I will be back!
0,"Recently, my husband and I made a trip to Las Vegas. Since we are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay, we made reservations at his \""Gordon Ramsay Steak\"" restaurant, in the Paris hotel. \n \nMy husband wrote a great review of our experience but it wouldn't fit here.  So this is the condensed version.  We had a reservation on a Thursday night for 8:15.  We arrived on time and were told by the woman in front that it would be 10-15 minutes.  Go wait in the bar.  No I'm sorry, nothing, not even a smile when we walked up to her.  We were later told by a manager her name was Danielle.\n\nWe went into the bar and it was packed and had to stand.  15 minutes later a couple that had an 8:15 reservation left and we took their seats and ordered a drink.  My husband went to check with Danielle who held up her hand in an impatient \""stop talking\"" manner,  and informed my husband \""You are the next to be seated\"". Then immediately turned her back on him.\n\nThen the people next to us who had an 8:30 reservation were seated.  I got up to talk to Danielle who was quite rude to me as well and informed me that \""someone\"" was in there looking for us.  Apparently when you arrive Danielle writes down what you look like and when it's your turn to be seated she gives your description to a young girl who has to come in an find you.\n\nFinally a young girl got us, at 9:00 for an 8:15 reservation.   I'm sure Danielle had forgotten about us and couldn't be bothered to apologize for her error.  We told the young woman you got us how displeased we were.  She had nothing to say and looked very uncomfortable.  We were seated and at this point I told my husband I just wanted to pay for our drinks and talk to the manager.  The waiter came and we told him, he apologized, first person to do so.  Then another man came up we told him the whole story, nope he was not the manager.  Finally the manager came up and by this time we were really upset.  He offered us a table near the kitchen.  There was no way I was going to spend several hundred dollars on dinner.  We had to repeat we just wanted our check, he comped us for the drinks.\n\nSo be aware, reservations mean nothing at GR Steak. We watch all of Gordan's shows, he always preaches STANDARDS.  Apparently he needs to teach some to Danielle and the hostesses of GR steak."
2,"I think all the hype about this place is for the dreamers.  I thought the cashier was inattentive, and was way too busy talking to his friends to pay any attention to us the customer's. The ice cream was alright but nothing to make me come back for more."
3,"This place was really good!\n\nWe chose to go here for a romantic date which was a mistake... not that we didn't have a good time but it was not a romantic setting at all. The name sounded romantic to me. But it was the opposite of romantic. Loud, brightly lit, sassy servers, and children running amok. Reminded me instead of a raucous Italian family reunion. But still a good time!\n\nI love that it's BYOB with no corkage fee. That itself is a great value on it's own. \n\nWe started with the bruschetta. We weren't planning on getting an appetizer but we were talked into it. Yes, the servers are a bit pushy with the upselling. But the bruschetta was tasty and bursting with fresh flavor so we were glad we did.\n\nI had the eggplant rollettini and my husband had the pork Parmesan. The portions weren't as big as they are in other Italian restaurants. I was expecting leftovers to take home. But still very filling. My eggplant was very tasty but a bit salty. My husband and I both loved the marinara. It was very unique. I detected a warm seasoning to it... cinnamon or nutmeg? I don't know but it was good. My husband thought his pork was delicious. He said it lacked breading but was still excellent.\n\nWe will definitely return but we learned our lesson. Expect a casual and energetic good time with delicious food. We see this being a great spot for a double date... each couple bringing a great bottle of wine."
4,"I live right around the corner and have never noticed this place since you can't even see the sign driving by it.  But if you drive by very slowly you can see the sign by the street telling you what they have in this strip mall and it just says \""coffee\"" for this place.  I ordered Going Bananas which is apparently their specialty drink and oh man~tastes exactly like chocolate covered bananas and it is DELICIOUS! The best part of that experience is how friendly the guy who works there is.  I'm not too sure if he's the boss or not, but he was very helpful and super nice! There are also a few games like checker that you can play there.  And I love the seating arrangement since you can have your individual table for laptop use then there's this super comfy sofa, I was so surprised when I sat down and sunk into it :)"
2,"The name has changed three times and every time this place has done this, the taste has declined. Spicy chilly mint was one of my favorite dishes. Pad Thai is also no longer the same. It has become to sweet. Also They have smaller portions now."
3,"They have pretty much everything you'd expect in Armenian market , i liked it."
3,"Rarely do you find such value at a $$$$ restaurant. Portions are larger than you'd expect even in the small plates for expensive ingredients like filet Mignon, lobster and foie gras. \n\nFood:\nTypical of high scale restaurants you get some freebies. Among the breads the garlic is the best, my co-worker went through five slices! Another freebie are prawns which are imparted with a smoky flavor from the grill, excellent. We got foie gras for our appetizer. It was served with fresh herbs on a graham cracker like crust. Juicy and succulent I can see myself getting foie gras much more often after this one.  The beef wellington i had was cooked perfectly. The dough and duck fat that surrounded it could not have been better. After being so pleased with the app and entree i was underwhelmed by the desert. The dark chocolate souffl\u00e9  came with a sauce that tasted like it had only a hint of dark chocolate. Not worth it for chocolate lovers.\n\nPrice: Although expensive these ingredients are usually twice the price at different restaurants.\n\nAmbiance: The whole hotel has the Frank Lloyd Wright feel which looks amazing although there is nothing special about this place when compared to the rest of the hotel.\n\nBottom Line: If you're staying at the Biltmore Hotel this place is your best bet for satisfaction."
2,We went to BB Kings Blues Club hoping to .....hear blues or jazz.  Instead we watched playoff games.  Yippeee?? THe band started to warm up as we were getting ready to leave. Very disappointed but our waitress was GREAT!!
0,Got into town late Sunday night and needed a place to eat. The guy at the hotel mentioned this place was nearby. Ordered a pizza and a salad. Both were terrible and lacked ingredients shown on the menu. Avoid.
0,"I'm seriously so over sprint. Spotty coverage, half the time my apps don't work because of low coverage... dropping calls, etc. Not to mention messing up payments and bills.\n\nTonight, however, I'm livid. My iphone died and I plugged it into my charger for 30 minutes. No luck. I tried two other chargers and still nothing worked. So I took it in to the store.\n\nSome employee with blondeish hair and black rimmed glasses came up and immediately acted annoyed he even had to help me. I explained my problem and said he could try plugging it in to their charger but \""if its anything more than that, youre gonna have to wait\"" Ummmm ok, rude.\n\nHe told me it was working fine and that I could just buy another charger if I wanted. No, I'd rather not waste my money. I got home and its been on the charger making the same screen it made at the store for an hour now, and it's still dead.\n\nSprint might want to have knowledgible employees when it comes to Apple if they're going to be dealing with iPhones. Guess I'll head over to the Apple Store for help tomorrow. Sprint and their employees are useless."
2,Great menu options. Service was hit & miss. Atmosphere lacked a little bit of energy. Food was good. Grits & Pork Belly was my favorite . Quality of food was even better. Pricey for BBQ. Once management figures it out will be a great place.
1,Pretty pricey and the food is just o.k. I have eaten there a few times and every time I came away thinking it wasn't worth the money. There are way better options in Pittsburgh
0,"My friend and I were looking forward to having lunch here on our lunch break last Friday. I drove by the new restaurant and thought it was a good idea to try it out, especially since we love Italian food. So we got there about 12:30 p.m. and there were about 4-5 tables of two customers each. We waited at the hostess stand, the waitress looked at us, but never acknowledged that she would be right with us or smiled or anything. So we waited for about 5 minutes. At this time, the other customers that were seated started looking at us. So needless to say, we decided to have lunch elsewhere. We would have liked to try the place out, but never had the chance to. I'm not sure if they are short staffed or something, but we would have waited had someone said they'd be right with us at some point...."
3,Good gym overall. Filled with a few meatheads and people posing for competitions but they don't bother anyone and provide some entertainment. I appreciate that the trainers are independent and you aren't haggled to sign up for a session with them- they are just there if you need them!
3,This is a nice mom and pop type restaurant. We arrived shortly after opening on a Sunday morning and were the only people in the restaurant. The waitress was friendly and offered us suggestions when we asked. We went with a green chili cheese crisp and a chicken chimichanga. Both were very good. I really liked the cheese crisp and that we were asked if we liked it soft or crispy - crispy all the way!\n\nI like the current decor but I think that they could soften some areas by hanging curtains or valances in the doorways or from the ceiling in the back to block the server area. Otherwise everything was very good and I would be happy to try Ayala's again.
2,"Been here twice sat in the outside area for happy hour the street tacos are good nothing amazing but for the price definitely a good snack and not bad. margaritas are definitely to sweet for me but that's not my field I'm a beer guy and they only have one beer on tap blue moon which is a little disappointing but I don't mind it those are a good deal as well. both servers I've had there were very good and the food was quick as well. It was a little annoying that the bartender went around and changed every single tv to Monday night football (an hour before the game was starting) after my server was nice enough to put on the basketball game I wanted to watch and he came over and changed it to the Monday night football pregame (with no sound mind you and not many people in the outdoor dining area) and followed it up by saying \""you weren't watching that were you im putting on Monday night football\"" well now I'm obviously not... Not a huge deal obviously but I didn't see the need for the Monday night football pregame on all 15 tvs especially since I was the only one in the vicinity of this one. Just a little tidbit there but in terms of service and food you can't go wrong with this place"
0,"We purchased photos online. We got there and immediately noticed it was very hot! The girl at the counter told us that the air-conditioner was broken and had been that way for sometime. They only had a couple of fans going. This was ridiculous. My son was there for a graduation photos so I wasn't going to cancel. If I were the one in the pictures I would have had to get a refund because my make up was melting right off my face just sitting there. Lol. They could have repaired that air-conditioner along time ago and given their customers a more pleasant experience but for some reason they hadn't. They didn't even warn me ahead of time the condition of the studio. It would have been nice to know that it would be such an uncomfortable temperature and possibly taken our business elsewhere. \n\nAlso, their props need to be updated because some are old and worn. They really weren't prepared for the pictures we were doing. Even though I left details about what we were there for. \n\nOnce we were done taking pictures we needed to view and choose the poses we wanted printed. The girl that was helping us was unprofessional and rude. She answered a personal call in the middle of helping us. She also interrupted me mid sentence to gossip with another employee as if my children and I weren't standing right next to her. And she almost ordered the wrong photos because of her lack of attention. Horrible employee. \n\nWe will definitely never go back!!!"
3,"Hate to give it up because I enjoy eating Breakfast here on the weekends when all the big names in the area are overcrowded with long waits. Great inexpensive food. Biscuits and gravy, homefries and ham and bacon all awesome! Owner and staff are friendly and efficient! Always great friendly service, hope you enjoy!"
4,"The place that originally brought me to NODA....what can I say about a place that has that much pull. \n\nIt's a place that tops many of my lists including First Date, Best Burger, Top Fries, and to many others to list. \n\nI never understood just how important this restaurant was to my pallet until I broke away from the cr\u00eapes. For the first year of dining here, I didn't order anything other then there crapes. I have now found that their are other food is absolutely unbelievable.  I'm not one to recommend particular dishes since food is such a personal desire; however, I do feel the need to point out that their burger and chicken Cordon Bleu Sandwich is a must try if you never have had it."
4,"Reliable, trustworthy auto shop! \nTook my Dodge Ram 1500 in for an evaluation, which was free. Another shop stated I need to have my rack & pinon replaced, radiator was leaking, thermostat was stuck open, and the  temp sensor was bad. Wanted to charge a lot to repair all items, $1500.00.\nI always get second and third opinions and I'm glad I did.  Yelped auto shops in Goodyear, called and was able to get in the next day. Phil was the one that looked over my truck and was very honest. Said that he wouldn't recommend the rack & pinon replacement because the leak was dried up, no wet dirt. Plus most rack & pinon do leak at first. He also said that the sensor was not bad and that the thermostat was the issue and that I did need a radiator since it was leaking.\nIn all, the write up was very reasonable and I went ahead with the work. Had it back by the end of the day.\nI will definitely be having this shop perform ALL maintenance on my vehicles!\nThanks so much for your honestly Litchfield Auto Repair"
1,"A friend and I sat at the bar for lunch. We had the baja tacos. 3 battered tacos with rice and black beans. The tacos were very good- the flour tortilla seemed home made. Overall, we were fairly impressed with the food. It is the service that left us unimpressed. The girl behind the bar was more interested in talking to her friends than serving us.  I had to flag her down, first, to get a menu, and then to order, and then to get a refill on my empty ice tea. After I asked her for an ice tea refill, she then actually went back over to the guy she was talking to and actually\nfinished her story - before getting the refill.  She tried to force a couple smiles to save things once she knew we were not happy with her service, but mostly acted like she wanted no part of being there. We were finished, and then waited at least 10 minutes for her finally to ask if we needed our ticket. Then she gave us the wrong ticket.... These type of people do not belong as the main bartender - they can definitely ruin your business.  Tacos and 2 ice teas with tip (which honestly she did not deserve) was $40. Next time, I will go to Rubio's..."
3,"I've been going here since they were in the old location up on East Blvd.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and their hours are convenient for me."
0,Both times I have been in here I have been disappointed.  Last time when I was look for a firearm they showed me a little pink gun I'm assuming because I'm a female. This time we came because online it states they are a full 5.11 retailer. They are not as we were only able to locate 1 polo that was 5.11. It is now the beginning of June and they still have a 2day sale sign up for 20% off 5.11 that is from May. Also because we were not looking at the firearms not a single employee spoke to us. I will continue to stay away from this store as they are not customer friendly.
0,"Very disappointing!  One of the worst steaks ever, they don't even grill them, cooked on a flat top.  No flavor at all.  Service matched the food quality.  We won't be back."
1,"HATED IT!  We were invited to a \""family dinner\"" with my daughter's new inlaws who were visiting from out-of-town.   We normally try to avoid anything near the strip, but we accepted the invitation.\n  The place was a freakin' zoo!   Jam packed and extremely loud!   We couldn't even hear the people sitting next to us, so having a conversation was impossible.\n  The food wasn't that great, and overpriced.  Small portions.\n  Service was horrible.  There were about 25 of us and we had 2 waitresses.   Our food arrived..... however several of our guests did not receive their food until about 15 minutes later!    \n  The best part of the night was watching my new son-in-law get \""spanked\"" by the German dominatrix.   Yes... that was fun!\n  I guess we're just old fuddy-duddies because we did not enjoy the LOUD atmosphere at all.   We will never go back."
2,"The food is great!  The drinks with breakfast is fan-freakin-tastic!  The service is OK.  I actually want to give them more stars, but consistently the group of girls I go with is ignored at the end of our meal, we would get more drinks, like water refills, and like to pay our check quicker.  The good thing is they don't often mess up our order and our orders are often difficult, so that is really nice.\nI usually get the French omelet and greyhound, the eggs are always fluffy and yummy and the salt bagel with lox cream cheese makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  \nI would recommend and take anyone to Chompie's, I would warn them about the service before so to set the expectations."
3,really good mexican food at a decent price.\nreminds me of senior taco... gotta love the horchata fountain and chilaquiles
2,"Napoleon's Dueling Piano Bar\nOverall\n3.75\n\nGold Medal - Extraordinary Pianist\nSilver Medal - Peppy Fun Environment\nBronze Medal - Free entrance\n\nThese pianist knows every song!  From Journey to Metallica.  Truely amazing.\n\nThere were people singing, dancing, and drinking.  People were having the time of their lives.\n\nThis is a free activity at night.  There is no admission fee and no drink minimum. Unlike comedy improv shows, where you get in for free, but the waitresses are hounding you for drink orders, causing you to miss the entire show. Here at Napoleon's, you pay for what you want to order.  If you want to request that special song that makes your body alive, you pay a tip with the name of the song written on a piece of paper.\n\nThe crowd was mainly 40 years old+.  All the younger hipsters are probably out hitting the dance clubs.\n\nHAPPY DUELING!!"
2,"It's OK food - nothing extraordinary.  The pricing, I thought, was a bit off given the quality of food/service.\n\nThe menu is pretty concise and to-the-point.  Very American palette-friendly."
2,"Would you believe that this little independent wine bar has been tucked away in this location for something like 7 years? It's true! But they're so hidden and unadvertised that they go completely unremarked. \n\nThe space is very small and a bit awkwardly designed. There are three areas; the outdoor patio, the first sitting area by the bar, and the second area with couches and different sized tables. I came here on... another first date (this is getting exhausting) on a weekday and there was another couple in the space. They were sitting dead center of the second room which made it weird for us to sit there. The music was also so low that you could hear every word that was said. Awkwaaarrrddd...\n\nSo we sat on the couch in the front room, it's pretty comfy for sure. The menu is extensive, with a good variety of wines to choose from. You can go by the bottle or do different flights of three wines each. We went for the bottle, since it was half off that night. \n\nWe also ordered the cheese plate. You can choose three of your own cheeses, out of about  8 options. This thing is huge! With only two people, there was no hope of finishing it. Especially since I was being all lady-like and didnt want to stuff my face with cheese and olives like a fatty. \n\nPretty much right at 9:35, the waitress comes over and asks us if we're done. I hate that. Seriously. You close at 10. Don't advertise that you close that late if you don't want to. I asked her if we needed to close out and leave and with hesitancy she responded \""well... no\"". Ok then. We'll stay until close!\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant enouch experience. The atmosphere is probably much better on the weekends when there are more people and they stay open later."
2,"Its pretty good Pho in a nice quiet location, Charming."
2,"Oh, dearest me, Sushi mon, Sushi mon, sigh, why oh why do you charge so much for all you can eat sushi? Is the fish quality better than any other AYCE sushi restaurants? Absolutely not. Are their rolls superior to other AYCE sushi restaurants? Nope!\n\nThis wildly popular sushi joint is gleaming with southern Las Vegas patrons. They are swarmed with clients day in and day out and late night. I walked in at 11pm on a Friday and there was a large crowd of people waiting to either get into the restaurant or just hanging out in front of Sushi Mon. I guess that is the new thing these days. \""Hey, we are going to hang out at Sushi Mon and pretend we are cool.\"" Nevertheless, the wait was short as I was dining alone and the bar was sufficient for myself. \n\nI started to look at their laminated menu and took a look around the restaurant itself. The restaurant itself is bland, Someone had the bright idea of putting tile, in a diagonal pattern, on the wall. Are you kidding me? EPIC FAIL. The seating is quite spread out and the restaurant itself is quite small. The sushi chefs are abundant, however, and that is usually a great sign for a busy restaurant. The patrons seemed happy indulging in their gluttony of raw fish, rice, mayo and cream cheese creations. I for one, always order the sushi first before I order any specialty rolls. \n\nThe salmon sushi was just meh to my standards. Their salmon was a bit  warm and the texture seemed off. The tuna was good and their yellowtail was surprising very good. I do have to say their rolls are quite interesting. I can't really remember what I ordered, but what I did order tasted a-ok to me. I remember asking my sushi chef to make me their best roll they had. It was some shrimp tempura roll concoction wrapped in soy paper. Can't remember the name but I remember liking it very much. \n\nAs for the positive sides of the restaurant, I can see why people like this place. The warm welcoming staff, the sushi chefs, and the massive amount of people waiting to attack their sushi rolls with their salivating palates. \n\nA word for the owners. You are doing a great job. I hope you continue to succeed. For Christ's sake, please take that stupid tile down from the wall and put up some authentic artwork or something! Augh, it really makes me not want to dine there because of the crappy decor. Stop charging so much for standard sushi quality! Then again, if people are paying it why stop right? I understand.  \n\nYes I would return to the restaurant, but, I probably wouldn't go by myself again. If my friends are willing to go I may just join them."
4,Phenomenal BBQ! We had the brisket sandwich and the Smokin Plate. Everything exceeded our expectations. I'm only sorry that we don't live closer!
2,"This is just an average cafe. We ordered fish and chips, fried chicken and a Belgian waffle. Everything was just ok. Not bad; not good. I do commend them for serving up fresh, fried chicken and not pre-fried frozen Banquet chicken like a lot of other places in Vegas. The prices are very reasonable."
0,"Wow, looks like everyone had the same experience I did.  Over priced bland food, no chips (unless you pay extra I guess), $2 for a tiny thing of guacamole.  Food was cold when it arrived and there were only about four tables - and it was during the afternoon.  Don't go here, it's a waste of money."
4,"Very friendly service, love that this place is locally owned! They will text you when your prescription is ready. Overall I've had great experiences here."
1,"I would like to start by saying all three of these stars are for the location and the view... not for the service or food. \n\nWe arranged to have a table on the patio through Kelly (the bachelorette coordinator) and requested a specific table... she made it happen! We had the best table in the house... dead center right over the lake... this was AWEOME. I just wish that was all we had done. \n\nWe had set up for a prefix menu of small plates and apps... our waitress seemed to have no idea of this. Once she was made aware, we all had one of their signature drinks. Ugh I would not recommend them... I had a mango jalape\u00f1o drink (seems hard to mess up that killer duo) basically it was just mango juice. I couldnt taste the jalapeno, bitters OR alcohol. When I said I couldnt taste any alcohol... she took it to the bar and came back and said \""well they said it was the standard pour\"" really? Helpful, thanks. This is just bad customer service. Seriously just add a splash and make the customer happy. There were 5 of us... no one liked their drinks. \n\nThe appetizers were ok at best. The best thing we had was little caprese crustini or something like that... that was pretty good.. but nothing else was too great. We were supposed to get churros with our menu... she said she was putting the order in, they never came. Honestly our waitress was pretty terrible. I will not be going back here. They need to step up the game to keep up with the other awesome restaurants in Vegas! \n\nSAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE."
1,"Waiting for my friends at the bar located near their entrance, I had a good feeling about this place.  It had all the bells and whistles of a nice upscale restaurant with a friendly bartender to start.  Unfortunately my good feeling about this place was short lived as our party was seated.\n\nOur reservation was for 9:15 PM Sunday night.  We didn't get seated until 9:45 PM despite having our whole party there by 9:00 PM.  I didn't care too much for this considering the place was moderately busy on a holiday weekend, and we weren't on a strict schedule.  So I let this roll easily off my back.\n\nAs we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter who was terribly unenthusiastic about his job.  He was considerate about asking  for food allergies.  Beyond that, all levels of consideration or customer service for that matter stopped there.  Granted, he warned us that our food would come out infrequently, but little did we know it would delay our dinner by over an hour.  A little honesty would have been greatly appreciated.  It took forever for most of our food to come out.  We didn't have utensils or place settings even after our food was delivered.  My friend even asked for the manager, to complain about our horrible service, or lack thereof.  The manager's response was something like: \""Things are are a bit backed-up, we'll give you free dessert.\""  Now, I don't care how backed-up your kitchen is... that's still no excuse for horrible and incompetent service!  Dessert only puts a band-aid on a broken arm... why the hell do restaurant managers  do this?  We are not looking to get something free, we just want to make sure they get their act together... and fast!\n\nOur original waiter rarely came to our table after we ordered our food.  Another waitress came to our aid who was very helpful and attentive to our needs.  She was very friendly and courteous, it's unfortunate she wasn't our original waiter because this review would've been completely different.\n\nOur unpleasant waiter did the weirdest thing.  As my friend was talking to the manager, being very open about our waiters horrible service, our waiter stood by our table as he refolded all our used napkins, tossing them onto our table.  Yes, our used clothe napkins.  Who does that?  In front of a party that is pretty disgusted by you no less.  It seemed as if he knew he was already in hot water and didn't give a rats-ass about making up for it.  In addition, he circled the portion of our bill they decided to discount for the unsatisfied service in a stuck-up negative manner.  In hind site, my friend said we should have taken that same pen, in front of our waiter, and scratched out his tip!  Of course, we're better than that.\n\nThe food is the only reason why this place is not getting a single star. The food was actually quite good with a variety of unique asian-fusion plates.  I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki (exotic right?) which was much more than I bargained for.  For such a simple dish, it had a variety of unique flavors with a side of extras that complimented each bite.  My friends ordered an array of food that looked just as good, and was commented on just the same.\n\nFor me, customer service will make or break any experience, no matter how good the food is.  In this case, their service failed horribly.  Our party ended up with a waiter that was a few cans short of a six pack regarding personality, who would probably fare better as a Chippendale's greeter than a restaurant waiter.  I hope management recognizes this and hires waiters that are actually qualified to interact with human beings."
3,"of all the empanadas i tried (i got the after 10pm 6 for $9 deal), the only one that really didn't work for me was the pizza pepperoni one.  Pepperoni is meant to be eaten as garnish, not as a main ingredient.\n\nAnd yes, i ate all 6 in one sitting -- partly because i hadn't eaten all day and because my hotel room didn't have a microwave."
3,Great little place just across the border.  Food is always great as well as service.
3,"oOoh been here once for dinner and about three times for lunch...it's really a great place for a quick and easy meal and it's not too fatty like other fast foods..and it's pretty cheap. \n\nI love their 3 piece dark meat rotisserie chicken that comes with a delicious cornbread (I'm usually not fond of cornbread) and two choices of sides. I've had the creamed spinach, corn, veggie mix, squash mix, roasted herb red potatoes and sweet yam which is my least favorite....the sweet yam casserole is just too sweet for my taste...so not a big fan of that one..other than that the other sides are pretty good. The meatloaf meal is also really good...two really good size slice of meatloaf also with a choice of two sides and a cornbread...2 bucks more expensive than the chicken but sometimes you want something besides chicken. heh\n\nSo for a quick easy cheap semi-healthy meal that does not consist of a hand full of grease (burgers, pizza, tacos of that sort..) then Boston Market is really a fantastic choice =)\n\nYummers!"
3,Aaron you have awesome customer service skills and also to the brunette bar tender!  You guys are awesome although the nacho's was a feat that crushed my confidence because of the large portion i will be sure to bring backup next time. Made a few friends too gregg and mariam from cali and mark from nm! Hope you see this hit this place up with a good review!
3,"Went on a Saturday night a couple weeks ago.  It's no cover before 10pm, but on that particular night (which happened to be a fight night) the place was already packed by our 930 arrival time.  For the price and the amount of time to wait in line (0 minutes 0 seconds), this place kicks ghostbar's pretentious butt!  The view is nicer because it's right on the strip, you can actually sit down (the tables aren't all \""reserved\""), the bartenders are friendly, the music is kept at a volume high enough to hear but low enough that you don't have to shout over it, and the crowd was lively.  Too bad the patio was closed off that night, no doubt for the fight night VIPs and hangers-on.  Dunno about the restaurant, but judging from these reviews here I might have to check it out next time through.  A+++ will do business with again!"
2,"I just finished my take out and here I am. I have dined there once before a year ago. I remember sitting there with my boyfriend. There were a bunch of young adults horsing around. The service was horrible and very distracting. One of the employees was sitting in the middle of the room (it's not very big in there) with her laptop stacking poker pieces. Another staff member knocked them over while bumping into the table. They argued over who was going to pick them up. So tonight we did take out. The food is great. We placed the order and it was ready in 15 minutes. Upon arrival I am greeted by a young lady who is on her laptop who does not bother to  look at me. Then an older female looked at me. I told her I was in to pick up an order. She asked what I ordered. As I list of my items: curry shrimp, beef and broccoli, and house fried rice, she rings up my bill and hands me my food. Overall, the food was good. The vegetables could be cooked a little longer. Service needs improvement. The room has some tables but people rarely dine there. There is a table in the front with healthcare items and supplements. That really threw me off. For a second I thought I walked into my gym."
2,Truly authentic Chinese food. You can tell by the fact that 99% of the patrons were Chinese.  One big negative was that we ordered water and it tasted like nasty city water. A place getting sulch good reviews should have filtered water. Large portions. Ordered the pork belly stew. While tasty it was extremely fatty. The meat would have been better if cooked more.
4,"Great food! This is a buffet style restaurant with awesome sushi, king crab legs, and tempura shrimp. The only downside is that they close at strange hours in the middle of the day."
4,"Sushi was delicious, had a great time singing karaoke, Wayne and his wife are a true treat amongst the typical Vegas service industry."
1,There pizza is average. The customer service us sub-par and if you enjoy ranch or any extras bring your piggy bank.
2,"I am sorry to have to give Craig's Cake Shop only three stars because I was expecting and hoping for better.\nThe staff was nice and the product was ok but it did not rise to what I was expecting to find based upon their many good reviews and the fact that they are a small local bakery as opposed to some large producer of a variety of baked goods.\nI compare it to Cupcakes A-Go-Go which exceeded my expectations in flavor and quality while CCS didn't do this.  Though CCS does use a very pretty frosting technique we didn't particularly like the flavor.  The cake was moist enough but the crumb and flavor did not reach to the level of what we have experienced from other bakery that we have purchased.  We once had an outstanding cake from The Rolling Pin and another one that was good was purchased at Metcalf's.  \nWe decided to try CCS in the hopes that we would find another bakery to add to our best list.  Instead, we will be going back to the Rolling Pin or Metcalf's for our next cake.\nThree stars state what is an a-okay rating which these cakes were just a notch below in relation to our high expectations.  But to not be so harsh I will give them this rating."
2,"Ok mod con shops, the place could do with some pazaaz, a better food court and an injection of love."
4,"Went to this place with a bunch of friends, one who was a local who kept ranting and raving about how great this place is. I understand why because this place has some amazing food.\n\nThe Cheesecake and Cesar Salad was the best I've ever had. If you don't like garlic or white pepper, you probably wont like the salad. The few dishes which stick out in my head are the Chicken Parmesan, Lobster Ravioli, and Baked Salmon. All three of these dishes were excellent. The portions were large, but the quality of the food was not sacrificed. \n\nThe service was just as great. The chef came to our table and offered to make any dish we wanted as long as he had the ingredients to make it. \n\nI will be going back to this place when I'm in Vegas."
3,J'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 cette visite! Balade sympa et tr\u00e8s instructive ^^ \nJe conseille!\n\n\n Dommage pr la partie des pingouins qui est en travaux en ce moment... Jaime tellement les pingouins que j'ai trouv\u00e9 tr\u00e8s triste de les voir coinc\u00e9s sur une petite zone.. :(
3,"Bon Chef Cafe offers tasty food at reasonable prices in a casual family-friendly atmosphere.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, they advertised a 2-for-$50 five-course dinner menu which consisted of Shrimp Cocktail, French Onion Soup, Caesar Salad, choice of entree (I got the New York Steak with Shrimp Scampi) and choice of cheesecake or Tiramisu for dessert. Yup, all this food for the bargain price of $50!\n\nWith a curious and rambunctious 10-month-old baby, dining out is challenging. When we saw other families with kids and the cute little play area, we knew we wouldn't be looked at with disdain if our baby would randomly let out a Pterodactyl shriek (which is his newest favorite thing to do). There was an old couple next to us that ignored our baby who kept waving and smiling at them but I understand not all people like kids. The owners and servers were friendly with our baby and that's all that mattered.\n\nEverything we were served from the first course to dessert was delightful. The stars of the meal were the rich and cheesy French Onion Soup and the light and fluffy Tiramisu. I ordered my steak medium, and it came out pretty well done. Not a big deal though since my shrimp scampi was delicious as was everything else on the menu. Their kitchen has an open layout so you can see all the action.\n\nEven though it was a special menu, several items are available on their regular menu. I'm dying to go back to try their Baked Lobster Bisque and their breakfast offerings. You can tell that they really care about their patrons' satisfaction because we were regularly checked on after each course. \n\nIf you're looking for good food at decent prices where you can take the kids, try Bon Chef Cafe!"
3,"This being one of the new hotels on the strip of Las Vegas, it has a modern theme to it. \n\nPROS -\n+ a chill, classy, relaxing resort.\n+ clean pool, clean rooms, clean hallways, clean everything.\n+ The rooms are extremely modern, with an electric mini-stove, refridgerator, microwave, dinner table, super soft bed, etc.\n+Extremly friendly staffs\n\n\nCONS -\n- This wasn't the ideal place to stay when you're in Vegas celebrating your 21st with your girls. (IE - little black dresses + alcohol + stumbling to the room = hard stares)"
3,"Since there was no escaping my worries by whisking myself away to Puerto Vallarta this weekend...I did the next best thing. I over-indulged in scents. 200 of them to be exact.\n\nI took a seat at the bar and instead of ordering a stiff drink, I grabbed a blank paper tab and begin mixing scents. Would it be liquid valium (lavender, mandarin orange and bergamot) or perhaps a little southern tropics (oatmeal, milk & honey and mango)?\n\nNo...I needed something bold and strong. I created what I'd like to call 'therapy'... chocolate, butterscotch and Columbian coffee.\n\nThe next decision was what to mix it in. Face lotions, shampoos, body wash and room mists to name a few. It's all earth friendly and cruelty free. They even have scents and shampoos for the K-9's!"
2,"Went here for lunch today for the first time and loved the atmosphere and service. Everyone was super nice and helpful and the booths are so cushy and comfy! \n\nMy friend and I shared the Mushroom and Sausage Pizza and the Chicken Chopped Salad. The crust, mushrooms and sausage on the pizza were excellent. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the red sauce. It needed more development, it tasted a bit like tomato paste out of the can. \n\nThe chicken in the salad was grilled and in nice, small, easy-to-eat pieces. The dressing was a bit watered down and lacking in flavor. \n\nAll in all, it seemed like Nook just needs a little bit of fine-tuning but has great potential. I would definitely be willing to give it another go, mainly based on the excellent service."
1,"I would love to tell you how the food was here.  I would be thrilled if I could write an 8 page diatribe that makes you drool because I describe the various tastes so well.  But I can't.\n\nWe hit this up on the recommendation of a friend on a Friday night.  Of course it's Friday in Gilbert, so we know it might be a little busy, but only one group was waiting when we got there. \n\nWe walk in and wait, and someone comes up to us and says \""2? It will be a few, what's your name\"" and then walks off after putting our name on the list.  I grab 2 menus and we start to wait.\n\nThe food must be great here, because the place was packed!  We watched, stomachs growling as plate after loaded plate was set out for delivery to the dining masses. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, we decided to grab a seat outside, as we kept getting trampled by the staff (it's not a big place.)  We sit, and see that there are now quite a few people waiting, all but the one group having arrived well after we did.   And then the magic moment came, several groups had finished their meal and were on their way!\n\nThe group before us (about 5 or 6 people) were seated, and we continued to patiently wait.  At this point it had been 20 minutes, which in my mind exceeds the \""a few\"" we were quoted upon arrival, but we were willing to be chill and wait it out.\n\nThen....(insert dramatic mood music here) a server came out and called a name on the list.....it was not my name, and no one in the line responded to it.  She called it a few more times, and someone who just walked in 5 minutes before stood up and said did you call Becky (name changed to protect the stranger) - not even close.  The server said \""No, but come on anyhow\"" and allowed this person to jump the line.  At that point we had enough hunger and thirst and went elsewhere.\n\nI cut a LOT of slack to servers, especially when they are busy, but the attitude and the service we saw in the 20 plus minutes of simply waiting left us cold.  I'd be willing to go back and give them a try, but I might pack a snack first."
4,"A few weeks ago, we had come here after a long time.  We decided to go again tonight, to see if the last time was a fluke, or they had really gotten that much better.  Well, the answer was...they really have gotten better!\n\nTonight our server was Joel, who was friendly, attentive and quick to refill our ice teas.  \n\nFor our appetizer, we got the zucchini fritte.  It was scrumptious!  The zucchini were cut in small strips, lightly breaded and seasoned, with an amazing garlic aioli dipping sauce.  We ate them like fries, they were so good!\n\nOur caesar salads were actually much better.  The last time, mine was underdressed and undercroutoned (if that isn't a word, it should be).  This time, it tasted like it should, and the parmesan on top was really wonderful.\n\nMy hubby got the same thing he ordered last time (combo of chicken parmesan and fried ravioli), but instead of garlic mashed as his side, he went with fettucini alfredo.  He told me that it was even better than the last time he had it.  I decided to go a little lighter and ordered the wood-grilled chicken.  It was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned and juicy.  My side was sauteed green beans, which were really flavorful.\n\nI decided to add the 5th star this time, since they outdid themselves with everything."
3,"Mama-Mia-American-Pizzeria is alrighty for Jungleboy.\n\nThe place is a jolly, colourful, multilevel building with alcoves and indoor window gaps. They have personally painted the walls with a  surrealistic piece depicting flying mushrooms, chili-pepper butterflies and a Pepperoni-Man saving the day. Funny!\n\nWe sat down on a table for two and we ordered our pizza - 9\"" with 3 toppings - I got pepperoni, mushrooms and chili-peppers (was I subliminally influenced by the painting? Yes I was..) It was a very well filled pizza and very tasty.\n\nI enjoyed the pizza crust, which I normally don't(!) and appreciated the laid back, but precise way of serving. They enquired if we were OK, we got our drinks served in time and we got to take the left over slices with us. \n\nI did find it a bit cold near the doors and I had a good view of all the people on the outside who peered in to see what this place is like. I made an effort to smile and wave to many of them to show how  good it was - but somehow the peepers backed away from the windows very quick when I did that. \n\nRecommend for a quick visit or even a nice afternoon late snack / meal with a bunch of friends or family, they had a cartwheel of a pizza available to serve to a big table of 8 - it was huge!"
3,"Came here for lunch with some work colleagues, where the parking spaces were scarce due to a small lot. I had the double charburger with cheese, onion rings and a drink for just under 9 bucks. The onion rings were good size, sweet and extra crispy; you can go wrong for under two bucks. The burger was good and definitely better when loaded. The place was packed so we had to wait about 15 minutes to get our food. Its worth coming back, just not during the lunch rush."
2,"It's amazing what a few blocks can do, in this case... not much if you're heading further East. I love me some Lao Laan... never really had Lao prior to moving to Madison. But I just don't get the same attentive service, sweet menu recommendations and authentic experience I so often found on Willy. What gives? The menu is more compact but the dining room is bigger, so it's perfect if you need room to groove, but other than the size, I think Willy is probably you're best bet if you're looking for curry east of the capitol."
4,Wife and I were there about a month a go for our anniversary and let me tell you the food was great amazing service our waitress that day was Courtney and she was incredible nice really enjoy our time thanks for the great service we were there on 04 24 2014 thanks again for the great food and service
4,"Their Sea Bass and Scallop dish with verjus is the best thing I've ever eaten. Two words: Tomato Jam. \n\nIt is not cheap, but worth the money. I look forward to returning and highly recommend it. \n\nI tried foie gras for the first time ever and was impressed. Both times I have been here (had the Sea Bass and Scallop dish both times... it's THAT good) we tried a cheese plate. The first time we asked our server what kind was good and she suggested the Bellavitano. I still feel like I owe her for this. A friend and I joke that Bellavitano brings people together.The second time we had that and the Moody Blue. Also a find. \n\nIf you are looking for a quality, delicious dinner and are not concerned with the price, Eno Vino is your answer."
1,"Am I wrong? So, I have an expired Groupon - cost $25 (Groupon was $55).  I was not asking for them to accept the $55 face value - I get that. But they wouldn't accept it for take out. I am solo and just wanted to use my $25 for a take out. I was planning to have a glass of wine while I waited and I always tip well. I purchased the Groupon originally because I really like Rudy's but I was unable to organize a group to go before it expired. Would it have been so hard for them to make an exception to their rule and let me use my $25 (which I've already spent) for a nice dinner at home?  I'm reconsidering Rudy's and am reconsidering Groupons in general."
4,"I'm not a car girl and Lester couldn't have been more accommodating.  I needed an inspection and he was able to take me the same day I called.  He's open past 7pm so the evening hours make it convenient to pick up or drop off. \n\nVery honest and upfront about the work he did, too...typical Pittsburgher who knows his stuff. Labor was $70/hour and parts were cheaper than other places. Cost me $3 to have a break light replaced.  Couldn't have been happier with the quick, honest, convenient service.  Lester's the best!"
1,"Went into Creperie Chez Suzette as I needed an early dinner and surrounding restaurants were not open for dinner yet. I was surprised that it serves savory crepe, in addition to the dessert crepe. As the weather was cold, I elected to order a soup, and a ham-cheese-spinach crepe. Perhaps savory items are not their specialty, and the choice was rather limited. So I shall be on the reserved side and rate it low for the savory crepe. Perhaps the sweet crepes will be better. The service was reasonable."
4,"We made a quick stop for a late lunch as we were drove through Wickenburg the road from Phoenix to to Las Vegas. The food exceeded our expectations and was served up faster than most \""fast food\"" restaurants. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, baked beans, sweet potato fries, and potato salad. My wife thought the sweet potato fried were the best she has ever eaten. I thought my brisket sandwich was great until I tasted the pulled pork, which I rated even higher. The baked beans were to die for. And to top it all off, they served up a warm triple chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. Wow!"
3,"We love Oyster Bar at Palace Station  but we have the kids with us this trip. So we decided to try this 1, it was pretty good. The pan roast is different than the palace station waster bar it was still good but the Oyster Bar palace at Palace station pan roast is much better. The gumbo was good, good bread great clam chowder. The lobster grilled cheese sandwich was good but we didn't feel it was really worth the price. Overall a good experience."
0,"Terrible! Multiple groups were waiting near the hostess stand and no employee noticed until someone went and found one. Not a busy night - multiple open tables. Finally was sat and waited yet another 20+ minutes to get drink orders. Supposed \""computer issue\"" (I understand these things do happen occasionally) but groups before and after us received their entrees, paid, and left before we received our appetizer. Entrees finally arrived and were cold and lacking flavor. Should/would have gone somewhere else if others weren't busy. It should have told us something when they were the only restaurant with available tables at the epicenter. Off night?"
3,"This is one of the first noodle joints I had tried in Charlotte and have stuck with since the opening of many more around the area. \n\nI'll keep my review to the point. It has noodles from the major regions of the world and you choose the meat or veggie that you want. This location is a fairly decent size, but I wouldn't imagine bringing a huge group inside. \n\nThe food I always end up getting is of good quality and freshness. I've never had a bad experience here, hence, the reason why I keep coming back. Their udon noodle and pad thai isn't too bad if you're looking for a quick fix, but not the best for sure. Fairly decent pricing, depending on what meat you usually get. Waiting staff is courteous and prompt and always willing to make things right."
4,"Our family spent Christmas at the Embassy-Biltmore and had a wonderful experience!! \nUpon check in we had reserved 4 rooms and I walked up to the front desk greeted by the friendly staff led by Joe ODonnell. I said my name once and Joe was aware of my reservation and the requests on the reservation. Without even looking down at the reservation!! This was the beginning of a stay that was perfect in all ways. The rooms were clean and the property was very well kept! It is an older property so we did not expect it to be new but we did expect clean and that is what we got! All of the employees that we encountered were fantastic!! The cook to order breakfast was phenomenal with wonderful staff there working for us on Christimas morning! The happy hour reception was enjoyed by some of our family and they commented how much fun they had with the bartender, Adam who was very attentive and again there working over Christmas! \nOne thing I noticed was that Joe was walking around the property and was very helpful at all times of the day and evening. It gave me a sense that someone knew what was going on in the hotel at all times.  I even saw him help an elderly couple to find their room and carried their luggage. \nIf you are looking for a great place to stay with your family (pet friendly) this is the place to go! We will be back next year and even though we live in the area, (Gilbert) we will be back throughout the year! We have a small dog and it was wonderful to be able to take her with us for Christmas. All of the other animal lovers there that had their furry families with them were very courteous and thoughtful! (We met outside when we were walking the dogs for a potty break) \nThe property works well for a family due to the two room set up with a living area and bedroom in the back. The beds were great in all of the rooms. We set up mini Christmas Eve horduerves in one room and enjoyed watching the games and each others company!! Not one person had to take the brunt of all of the company at one household and cooking. We did eat Christmas dinner outside of the hotel but will enjoy the Omaha Steakhouse on the property next year. \nThank you for making our holiday such a success!!"
3,"I come here for 1 thing and 1 thing only - cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nSure, I've tried some of their entr\u00e9es but the only thing that keeps me coming back is their dessert.  No matter what time of day it is, I will always return.\n\nHere's my rating on some of their dishes:\n\nEnglish Style Fish & Chips = 3 stars\nChicken Noodle Soup = 3 stars\nHalf Pound Angus Beef Burger (w/cheese) = 4 stars\nHomemade Meatloaf = 3.5 stars\nReuben = 4 stars\n\nWhat makes their cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e so special?  It's served in a trio dish with the following flavors - regular style, over chocolate, and with bananas. Delish!"
0,"Coffee good as usual but incredibly long lines and slow service.  Almost seemed like there was something wring with their POS system.  Staff seemed frustrated too and weren't too friendly.  Plenty of other Starbucks nearby, avoid this one."
4,"I've lived here for 1.5 years and am surprised to see anything less than stellar reviews - especially ones posting outlandish claims.  For purposes of this review, I'll focus on my experience since becoming a tenant.  As others have stated, the complex itself is fantastic - great grounds, pools, apartments and location.  However, it is the staff which necessitated I leave a five-star review.  I have been a serial renter and have found the staff at The Dakota to be top notch and 2nd to none.  I have leaned on them heavily and admittedly, have been demanding at times.  Whether it is picking up my weekly deliveries or setting high expectations in terms or my service requests, they have always gone out of their way to accommodate me, show proper urgency and handled with professionalism and a welcoming demeanor.  If you're in the market for a new place and want to know more than what brochures and websites convey, have confidence in the team here.  Cheers -"
1,"I hate to say this, but out of all of the cupcakeries I've tried, Cream & Flutter is my least favorite.  From frosting to cake...very disappointing.  Maybe I should go for a cookie next time?"
0,"Expecting a professional establishment? Expecting good customer service? Expecting to be greeted as you come in the door? Expecting to be helped in a decent time frame? Well, don't go here, ever. I've been to this place twice and both times were a bad experience. When you walk in the door, you're not sure where to go because the place is so sloppily put together. So naturally you stand, and you wait, expecting for someone to come and help you. Not the case here. The employees sit and have casual conversations while they should be helping customers. \nI stood and waited for almost 30 minutes both times.. The first time I was coming to buy cleaning solution, the second time, I was coming to get a piercing tightened. Its not like I was going to get some huge tattoo or something, my visits shouldn't have lasted for more that 10 minutes each, yet I was forced to wait and wait, to the point that on my second visit I gave them a piece of my mind and went elsewhere. \nAnd they have this disgusting leather couch that they have people sit on while waiting for their service, I'd suggest you not use it, you'll probably get AIDs."
1,"This place used to be my favorite on the strip! We used to go for cheap drinks and foot-long $1.99 hotdogs. And now its been replaced by Nathans unimpressive dogs :/ They swapped out a lot of slots for Arcade games, which is decent, but I'm just generally disappointed in the changes."
4,In heaven every time I step foot in this restaurant. I can't say enough about Joe's Seafood and I can't think of one entree that I haven't loved! Great lunch menu as well and the seafood salad is to die for!
2,"We went there for breakfast a Monday morning.  It was near noon, but they serve breakfast all day.  The place was pretty crowded and seems to be popular with older folks. It's very kitschy, but it has that old mom-and-pop diner atmosphere, and that type of menu as well.  We tried their stuffed French toast and their pancakes combos. The food was good, tasty enough, but not particularly outstanding or inspired.  Basically, this is your typical all-American breakfast joint.\n\nFull review at http://www.marga.org/foodblog/2011/08/omelet-house-las-vegas-review/"
0,"I wouldn't choose any stars if I had the opportunity to. I recently bought a gift card from this location for $120. When I first called this location, they said there is nothing they can do about it. When I called another location, they said that Massage Envy has the information on file, and can easily pull it up. I called the Rainbow location back and they refused to do it. They are trying to keep my $120 for no apparent reason. Why should they be entitled to my money? They have the giftcard number under my account, so why can't I use it???? No one else can, so what's the difference? I even talked to the manager who #1 wouldn't let me finish my thoughts, and #2 was very rude and hung up on me when I asked for her name. \n\nDON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION. GO TO ANOTHER ONE THAT WON'T STEAL YOUR MONEY."
1,"Oh New Zealand Caf\u00e9, I really wanted to love you...but unfortunately, I found you to be \""meh\"".  \n\nWhen I walked in around lunchtime the other day, there were a good number of people in the small dining area, but there were quite a few tables open, so I was seated immediately.  \n\nUnfortunately, when I walked in, the place smelled fishy, not good. Based on the smell of the place, I was a bit worried about how fresh the sushi was, so I decided to pass on that.  \n\nInstead, I ordered a shrimp & chicken hibachi which was served \""bento box style\"" with brown rice, salad, chicken skewers, and some sort of 'cheese-filled ravioli' (odd!).  The shrimp & chicken was ok, but was a bit too salty for my preference.  The brown rice was oddly flavored, a bit greasy, and cooked with corn or something odd like that mixed in (WTH?!). The chicken skewers consisted of 2 small skewers with oddly reddish looking chicken that was seriously dry & overcooked.  The cheese ravioli thingies were also odd tasting and not especially good. Sadly, the salad was drenched in some sort of yucky salad dressing.  Overall, I was very disappointed with the food. \n\nOn the plus side, the food was pretty cheap, and service was pretty good.  I just wish the quality & flavor of the food was better."
0,"Not only did I receive poor service when I bought my car about two years ago, but they still call me and send me stuff in the mail.  I had a salesman call me a few months ago and leave me a message so I called back and left a message for him to call me back.  He called back and I politely asked him to take me off their calling list and told him about my buying experience.  He apologized and explained that they don't do those shady business practices anymore and asked me to come in for just 20 minutes (so that he could try to convince me to trade in my car).  I told him again I wasn't interested in buying ANY car from anyone right now as my current one meets my needs and told him again to take me off the calling list.\n\nThey sent me a birthday card and called me on my birthday and asked me to call back (again probably to try to get me to come in and buy another car).  I finally recorded a voice mail for them explaining my poor experience and saying that I would be calling a lawyer if they called again.  They didn't leave a message that time and I haven't heard from them yet.\n\nThese people are seriously desperate to take advantage of anyone and must think the previous buyers are dumb enough to buy from them again.    I hope they go out of business soon."
2,Passable middle eastern and mediterranean food in a nice State Street setting close to campus.
3,Some of the best coffee I've ever had.  Only thing that takes them down is the price.
0,"Nasty.   Bad food.  Rude,  indifferent staff.  1 star is being generous."
2,"We tried curry on murray last week and were sadly disappointed.  The\nrennovation from sababa did little to improve the space - it is still\nvery sterile with lots of hard smooth surfaces which do little to\nlower the noise level.  More importantly, the curry's were lacking in\nflavor.  We had both the green curry with tofu and the pumpkin curry\nwith duck.  Both were disappointing.  We started with the papaya salad\nwhich we ordered spicy - and it was - but the only spice content was\nheat - no flavor."
1,Ugh the rudest cashier never spoke a word not even a hello she thru my stuff into the bags and just stuffed it with anything and everything. Ruth your a rude person
3,"After one pho lunch I wasn't sure if I was ready to give Saigon Bay five stars - that's a big deal people!\n\nMy \""regular\"" portion of pho was plenty and plenty delicious. I opted for P2- filet and the meat was sliced thin and came raw in my to-go package as to not over cook in the hot broth.\n\nThe to-go order was ready quickly and packaged well for transport. Saigon Bay is in front of Sushi 101 - in case you were turned around like I got.\n\nA bowl of love that will satisfy any pho craving- can't wait to try them again and truly rave."
2,"The salad dressing was good, greens a little bitter but in was okay with that.  The curry is a good japanese style curry.  If you are looking for an exact replica of CoCo Ichibanya, you should keep looking."
1,"Had a very lack-luster Mother's Day brunch at Casbah yesterday. Despite having a very late reservation time of 2:30 p.m., we were seated in the dungeon-like basement dining room. I asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request. Worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. Service was fine. Timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day, but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there, not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base. An utterly forgettable mother's day brunch (luckily she took it in stride) but I think Casbah will not be at the top of the list in my book for quite awhile."
2,"This is a fun place to eat, but just not my cup of tea.\n\nThe service was very good and is what gets it a passing grade.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was very average. Everything was completely over-seasoned, so much so, that i could only eat half the food, and I was starving. Do not get the special hash and the potatoes on the same plate, they are seasoned nearly identically and would require you to drink a gallon of water to even attempt to finish it all. The quality of everything else though is fairly good though and i think this is why it is popular here. Maybe just stick with waffles and pancakes, they did look pretty good.\n\nIt is hard to say that i would recommend this place, maybe i would if I knew that person loved over seasoned food. It is a fun place though."
2,"While I've eaten here in the past and the traditional Eggs Benedict was fabulous, today I decided to try the Southwestern version which comes with chorizo instead of ham. The spicy chorizo completely overpowered the rest of the plate, drowning out the flavors of the eggs and hollandaise. I will certainly not order that dish again, but rather go back to the traditional version.\n\nThe service was just ok, not especially friendly, but our drinks were kept filled. Make sure that if you eat here you have time to wait for your food because it is also not fast. \n~JS"
4,"If you want a very filling and enjoyable sandwich for a great price, try out Capriottis.  The first sandwich I ever tried was a Bobby, which is Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  It was very tasty and filling that I was full after half a sandwich.  You get a mix of turkey, gravy, stuffing, and more goodies.  There are other great hot sandwiches available as well."
0,Not only are they the SLOWEST pharmacy they very seldom have the medication in stock that you will need. Do yourself a favor and go down the road and don't even bother stopping here they're going to send you to Desert Inn location anyways.
0,"Awful. I've frequented the Serendipity's in New York many times and this location is nowhere near in comparison. To start, we had to wait at least 15 minutes on a weekday at 2pm for two people. There were plenty of empty tables inside and outside. The problem seemed to be that they lacked enough staff to actually clear and clean the tables as soon as patrons left.\n\nWhile we waited for our table, we stood outside and perished the menu posted on the wall. Was looking forward to trying their sundae with the humble pie. As soon as we sit down inside and look at the menu, we realize the menu isn't the same. I asked the waiter where the sundae was on the menu and he tells me that they don't make humble pie anymore and that the menu outside is old and they haven't bothered to change it.\n\nDisappointed, I order a cookie sundae and my friend orders the frozen hot chocolate - something she had been looking to try the whole trip.\n\nThe deserts come quickly. Her dessert is much smaller than the one they have in NYC. My sundae is mediocre. Basically just cookie dough ice cream and a cookie. 5 minutes after serving our desserts, our waiter comes and drops off the bill basically preventing us from ordering anything else.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be frequenting this location again. It's not worth the hype - nothing like the movie. John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale would definitely not approve!"
2,"I give it a 3 1/2 stars.\n\nMaybe we just ordered wrong?  I was super hyped about District One and I even braved the cramped parking lot with our SUV just to try this place out.  But we came away just a bit underwhelmed.  No pop!  No wow!  Just a long, drawn out poot.\n\nDistrict One was hoppin', no joke there.  Sports on the TV, alcohol flowin' freely, and lots of heads on tables.  Very busy but luckily no wait when we visited.  The place is nice - modern, vibey, nice leather booths.  Shiny & new!  But the food...eh...was a bit lackluster.\n\nI love me some Vietnamese food, and I love me some fusion.  But while that may be good and appreciated, I gotta sway back to the classics.  What good is fusion if you don't have the classic down?  Does one not learn how to walk first before trying a 360 kick flip?  Do you just approach Heidi Klum and MInka Kelly without mastering the art of taking the 'grenade'?  I think not.\n\nPerhaps we should have ordered differently at District One, because what we had just didn't impress.  The menu looks delicious, rice dishes, soups, noodles, lots of Asian-inspired cuisine.  But that day I really wanted pho, and the wifey really wanted wings.  \n\nWe started off with the Tamarind Wings.  Wow.  For $6, I'm sorry to say, I felt a bit ripped off.  These were 6 of the tiniest @$$ wings I've ever seen!  At $1 a piece damn were they small.  I mean, these wings were literally half the size of those you see at a place like Wing Stop.  Nearly no meat!  I guess I wouldn't have complained if they were some bomb-diggety wings...but...they were bland.  Oh, just bland.  There was a bit of sweetness to them but that was it.  One note.  No mixing of flavors, no sour, no heat, no crunch, no nothing.  I don't think they were properly seasoned as well because I didn't get much of a salty flavor either.  So plain.  This app definitely left the wifey and I hungry and hoping the main dish would fit the bill.\n\nWe both stayed basic and got the Pho Bo Vien, the beef pho.  It came to the table steaming hot, nice.  But again....what's with the portion?  The bowl was smaller than what we were used to at other Vietnamese places around town.  And for $8 each, we were a bit surprised.  At other decent places around town, for the same price I can get the special pho with more goodies, and in a bigger bowl.  We got our little plate of veggies as well for sharing.  This included some basil, bean sprouts, and fresh chilies.  The pho was pretty good, District One has some great broth.  Not overly salty, lots of complex flavor, good on the palette.  But boy did I crave for more noodles and more beef to sop this broth up.  \n\nThe service for us was excellent.  Server was very attentive, wasn't hesitant to let us know if we had any questions on the menu to just ask.    Water was kept filled.\n\nOverall it was an OK first visit to District One.  The wifey and I left hungry and were eating again less than two hours later.  I think place does warrant another visit, but maybe next time we'll go with the more popular dishes they serve.  I do fancy some Big Bone Soup or some Oxtail Pho!"
4,"I went to Tableau on the recommendation of two friends who had eaten brunch there the previous day - and who wanted our whole group to go back for lunch before we left Vegas.  Vegas has a lot of restaurants (in case you didn't know) so the fact that these two felt strongly about eating at the same spot twice in a three day trip bode well for our meal.\n\nAnd holy moly roly poly.  I'd eat here every day if I could.  First of all, the place is darling.  It feels intimate and the decor is vaguely dollhouse, a great spot for a fancy tea party.  Or brunch, I suppose.  The service - stellar.  The presentation is sweet, with bread in individual tins and hot chocolate served in a fancy pot.  But most important - the food is superb!  \n\nI started with a warm portobello mushroom soup that was poured out of a beautiful little teapot over some little lobster raviolis.  This is one of the best soups I've ever had the pleasure of planting my face in, with deep flavor and that perfect buttony mushroom texture.  After polishing that off like a starved orphan, I moved on to an outstanding steak salad with balsamic, blue cheese, bacon, and more mushrooms.  That was another clean plate.  I finished out the meal (hey, it was my last of the trip, don't judge) with a gorgeous parfait with plenty of berries and lemon custard that was out of this world.  My friends all seemed to enjoy their food as well, and the miscellaneous bites I stole were all fantastic.  I will also mention that the fries are great, and the homemade ketchup (in which you can actually see tiny seeds!) is really several cuts above the bottled stuff.  Definitely give this place a go.  I can't wait to go back."
1,Fatty steak in the steak tacos. Toppings tossed on sloppily to bury the shells under a mound. $12 bucks for some mediocre lunch tacos... Me thinks not.
0,"OK, So I am normally a pretty big fan of Arby's. As far as fast food goes, its near the top of my list, but I will never go to this particular Arby's again. Everytime I go, something gets screwed up, and the last time I went everything about it pissed me off. I got a large drink with so much ice that I could'nt even get a straw into it, and once I managed too, there was about 2 ozs of liquid in a 32 oz cup. I asked for Arby, Horsey, and ketchup at the window, and ended up with 1 pack of Horsey. And I think for an $8 regular combo meal, they can throw a few sauces in. Very disappointed in Pecos and Windmill Arbys right now."
1,"This Pizza is LAME.  I should have gone with my instinct that a downtown \""pizza by the slice\"" pizza joint shouldn't be completely empty at 11:30am on a weekday and gone somewhere else, but I didn't.  \n\nThe place was completely empty and it still took them 12 minutes to get me my two slices (which were huge).  \n\nI hate to say it, but the pizza completely sucked.  The crust was so rubbery that I couldn't pick up the slice without it flopping over.  \n\nFor two slices and a coke I paid nearly $8 but I wouldn't have paid $2 for that \""food\"".  I forced myself to eat one slice and then threw out the other.\n\nYuck"
3,We have stopped here for lunch many times and always had a good experience.  The service is good and so is the food.  I do find the price a little bit high for what you get.
3,"So the first thing that might run through your mind when you stumble across this place might be, \""how good can an italian restaurant be that shares a parking lot with a BAP Imports Auto Parts?\"" But don't let this strange little strip mall make you drive on by.\n\nI first discovered Anzios when I was working in a corporate center near metro and was desperate for different lunch choices. My delight in discovering this little place was offset by the quick 5lbs that I put on after realizing my dream of eating lunch there 3 times a week.\n\nThe prices are great, the staff is friendly, the food is fabulous, the portions are decent, and the atmosphere is relaxed. This isn't one of those pretentious places that you go to be seen, but if you want really good food, you have found the right place.\n\nLet me start by saying they have THE BEST garlic bread that I have had outside of little Italy in NYC. I'm not a huge fan of their Chicken Parm, but everything else is spot on. My favorite is their meal is their spaghetti dinner with tomato sauce and sauteed mushrooms. All dinners come with either homemade soup or a great salad and the bread that I mentioned above.\n\nIf you want to watch the game sit in the room with the bar and you will be able to root on your team while munching down on some of the best pizza and wings in town.\n\nAnd if you want pure comfort food, order the Don Steak sandwhich. It's been a while since I've been to Philly, but this is an incredible version of the cities famous sandwhich (make sure to ask for sides of alfredo and red sauce) that is sure to please.\n\nThe desert menu is limited, but if you have any room after stuffing yourself with an entree, might I suggest one of there hot fudge sudaes. It is served on a hot brownie, topped with all the great googly moogly stuff and is big enough to share with three friends!\n\nI love these little non-chain joints and anytime two people can have dinner, wine, and desert for around $40, it's a keeper."
3,"The hubby LOVES beer - I mean LOVES it - so I decided to surprise him by taking him to FPBC in Tempe - we had the little guy with us (as usual - I mean that in a good way). We pull right up front - Rock Star parking!  I see the misting systems going - and people hanging around the front.  Beforehand, we had a little trouble finding it so stopped at a house to ask for directions.  There was a happy hour house party going on - about 10 - 20 somethings hanging in the front yard playing ping pong & BBQ'ing - looking like a beer ad for a commerical - we asked about FPBC & the guys were very happy to help us with the directions and said cool spot you will like it!  I say to my hubby, see this is why I love Tempe, are you sure you don't want to sell the house in PV and move here!?!  Hmmmm....\n\nSo we find it, my first thought was ok, part the BWM around the corner so we blend in!  Then I thought nah, lets just go!  The first thing I noticed was a sign that read \""no Minors\"" so I have the hubby wait in the car and ask the very hip, very alternative looking door guy if we can bring our baby in & he says sure just don't try and slip him a drink!  I thought I like this place already!  We sat outside as it was a bit too loud inside (for the little guy).  As well, that scene in Sweet Home Alabama played in my head about the girl in a bar with a baby!  So we sat outside - thinking that would be better? Hee Hee...\n\nMind you I hate beer but played along, so I ordered the lightest beer on the menu it was a peach ale - YUMMY!  The hubby ordered three weird tasting beers and loved each one.  We had the chicken rolls which we amazing and the shrimp Bruchetta (sp?) they use WAY too much garlic but it was still good and a great portion size.\n\nWe will go back for sure, but I think we will leave the baby at home - so we can really enjoy the noise :)"
1,"Another run-of-the mill Americanized Thai restaurant that seems to be the norm around AZ.  Rubbery meats, American broccoli, boring carrots and zucchini. No spice factor, few herbs and fish sauces, no authentic dishes, or dishes done authentically. Where's the roasted duck red curry, larb salads, Asian/Thai vegetables, whole-fried fish, papaya salad with blue crab? Oh, I forgot I'm in Central Phoenix. Geeze, I'm such a food snob. If ya'll think this is good, your mouth will MELT when you get the real stuff.  On the plus side, it's a nice, small restaurant and was very busy at lunch. To-go orders don't get the house salad they serve but you do get a little eggroll wrapped in foil.\n\nMy search for  true Phoenician Thai food with bold, complex flavors continues.  Any leads would be greatly appreciated."
4,"So this place was just awesome! Come prepared to spend some bucks though..we had all the reccomended dishes from fluke sashimi w/truffle oil and capers,softshell crab,garlic yellowtail, soy black cod w/foie gras,baked mussells w/butter aioli. We also did scallop hand rolls and kumamoto oysters(my wifes fav) too which is our favorite whenever we go japanese. All I gotta say is they know what they are doing here and you will not be dissapointed they aim to please your tase buds here for sure"
0,"Appointments are usually 1-1.5hrs late. There is no direct calling, only voicemails or representatives that say \""oh, thats not my department, but you can leave a message for the nurse\"" or \""you need to call back and select option ______\"" which takes you to a voicemail.... The dozen I have left have never been returned. The documentation I need is never faxed and thus the prescription I got in June remains unfilled. Stay away, I will be."
4,"Glad my husband and I decided to do brunch here. Really nice environment, friendly waiters and super yummy food. The french toast was so delicious. A little fancier than other breakfast places, they even brought out a foot stool for my handbag. I would definitely come back here again when I'm in town."
2,"Typical bar-type food, good beers on draft, lots of TVs......good place to watch a game.  I highly recommend the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, or the Blackened Tuna sandwich."
4,"OK, this place is not for your average pet owner...\n\nThe prices here are higher than PetSmart or other kennels, but the accomodation and service are exceptional:  \n\n1)  Even the base rooms are quite large.  My 80lb Labrador had a 5x12 room with his own TV, persian rug, and doggy bed.  There is even a Presidental Suite that is bigger and more luxorious than a lot of studio apartments.  \n\n2)  The animals are only locked up at night... all day they get to run around in one of two large areas inside and play with the other dogs.  They also have a grassy area indoors to allow the dogs to do their duty.  :)\n\n3)  The staff is very friendly and loves animals.  My dog lost about 7 lbs during a 2-week stay here due to all of the running around with the other dogs... they actually called me told me he looked skinny asking if they could up the amount of food he was getting.\n\n4)  Location is very convienant to the airport--easy to drop off and pick up.\n\n5)  Everything is indoors, so there is no need to worry about your dog running off while being walked on the leash.  Also, during the summer months, it is comforting to know that my dog is not outside dying in the heat.\n\nThey also offer Doggy Day Care which has proven useful a few times."
3,"This is one of my favourite Indian restaurants in Arizona . Very good food, very good service. Their Goat curry is so very yummy and the staff is always so friendly. If you are unfamilar with Indian cuisine then would recommend going to the lunch buffet to sample a variety of dishes. The prices are also reasonable."
0,"I always enjoy a healthy and quick lunch, and honestly the food is pretty good here.  Unfortunately, the service - by the owner and the employees - is horrible and I won't be going back.  \n\nI went to Extreme Pita today with 2 other coworkers at 11:15 a.m.  We were the ONLY one's in the store, so we beat the lunch rush.  However, it still took them at least 10 minutes to make our sandwiches.  I got the veggie pita with a water and chips and it was $10.\n\nWhat really upset me was that I asked for hot sauce on the side.  The owner filled it up not even half way.  I didn't get any sauce whatsoever on my pita, this was all I asked for.  I used the half of a container she gave me, and went up to get more.  She said she would have to charge me $0.59 for additional hot sauce.  \n\nI do think it's outrageous that I couldn't get enough hot sauce for my pita without being charged.  At most establishments, hot sauce is on the table, given at no charge.  \n\nWAY too stingy with the sauce.  You lost our entire party's business over an ounce of hot sauce."
1,"I really have mixed feelings about this place. If I were to base the rating solely on the all glorious Volcano Roll...this place would get 5 stars. Unfortunately I have to consider other things that detract from the love of one roll. I have been going to this place for years. My family from the east coast always request to go here when they are in town (which maybe more of a fascination with the AYCE thing.) I ate here a few weeks ago and was very sadly disappointed. The hubby and I sat at the sushi bar. The place wasn't busy by any stretch of the imagination yet the orders we placed took an insanely long time to prepare. We ordered Cajun albacore, hamachi, a volcano roll and a Todd roll. We also ordered shrimp tempura from the kitchen and calamari. We quickly got edemame and started to devour it. We then got our tempura orders. This whole time I am watching the sushi chef that took my order...chopping something for another dish, or to stock they're bar, or whatever. We waited 20 minutes for the Cajun albacore!!!! In the meantime another couple came in and ordered a roll. The same sushi chef that took my order...made a Philly roll and gave it to them....I just glared at him thinking when are you gonna make my sushi rolls???? My hubby (very mild-mannered and timid) was begging me not to say something. Then (under my constant glare) the sushi chef made our hamachi and the other 2 rolls. It took 30 minutes to get this little amount!!!!! Aside from that. I actually had to get out of my seat and go over to the waitress (talking to the other waitress) to get me a drink refill (much to the chagrin of my hubby.) I was never asked for a refill on any of the tempura orders ( which are included in the AYCE menu.) \n\nI honestly believe that they stall making your sushi so that you will: \nA) get pissed off and leave! \nB) get full quicker since you are eating slower, and therefore you eat less. \nC) run out of the 45 minute time limit and not be able to order anymore. \n\nThis used to be such a good place, and such friendly people. I don't know if a new owner shook up the place or what...but it breaks my heart to say that I don't think I'll be going back here anytime soon."
0,They made me answer 20 different  security questions because my debit card is lost. Even though I answered all the questions correctly they still made me call corporate to get an approval.  I've spent almost 45 minutes with two children simply trying to make a non complicated withdrawal from my account. I shouldn't have to fight this hard for my money.
3,Very good food! Nice staff! Would come back!
1,"Food is cold, over rated, not fresh and service isn't friendly. Waiters are always rushing you to order. This BJ's on this side of town is awful! Please get better management."
4,"This is a nice classy place to go for some awesome happy hour and play bocce ball!  Seriously!  And it's not a dive bar.  It has a great atmosphere, everyone is friendly, and they let me get half fries half onion rings at no additional price!  Yeah!  ;)   This is my new favorite place"
0,This past weekend I went to the mint for their 24K brunch which is supposed to be amazing.  Unfortunately I didn't even get the chance to try it.  I walked in with 2 friends and was not even acknowledged by the hostess.  We had to ask for a menu and were rudely handed them.  We asked for a table and she said to seat ourselves so we did.  We were promptly given waters by who I believe was a buser.  We asked to order drinks and he said our server would be right with us.  After 30 minutes we gave up and left. Our server never came.  We asked multiple people where they were and the answer was always that they would be right there. I was appalled that this happened.  I was looking forward to testing this brunch out.  Service is important and The Mint has terrible service.
0,I don't get it. Its about time they tore down this casino and put up a real one.
3,"Kaya's food and ambiance are pretty spot-on. Good flavors, interesting concept (island fusion cuisine), and beautiful decor. They even fit my party of 4 in with no notice on a weekend evening (wow, right?) and the service was great.They didn't get that last star because I can't give them full credit - they said the food was \""very spicy\"" when we got there, and it was barely a 1-2/10 on the spiciness scale. I understand that not everyone loves spice as much as I do, but you don't lead with that kind of promise and then disappoint. Oh well. I'll be back anyway, just will have to make sure to ask for extra spice. The black bean dip was great, the tofu cracklins were FAB, and the fish was all very very good. Prices were reasonable for the quality."
0,"Beware of Realtor Joseph Devera!\n\nJoseph Devera is a shady, unreliable, and untrustworthy realtor.\n\nIf you have a concern of your realtor don't bother calling partner Harvey Blankfeld, clients are NOT there concern.\n\nLastly if you contact CEO Mark Stark he forwards his concerns to managing broker Catherin Bovard."
4,Really great panang! This is one of the best place to eat lunch in the area.
1,"mm.. it's okay here!? \njust moving from one state to another and getting situated at home calls for a lot of take-out, so i figured... now's the time to really see what's up with these places that are generally new to the area too... (sort of.)\n\nso, i say....\ntheir are better places for chinese take-out."
3,Loved this place.  Burgers are awesome.  Especially with the baked potato fries.  Loved sitting outside.  Great family place.
4,We ate here last\nMinute. This was the only place open late on a Sunday and I'm glad that we ended up\nHere. The vibe is modern and comfortable. Very spacious and the food is more than bomb. The Lisa Lisa roll is a must! I would definitely eat here again esp since I visit monthly.
1,"And now, the long awaited Kabuki update... to be fair, this update is a combination of several mishaps and events... they all are related to each other, and therefore I felt they needed to be reviewed together. \n\nAs I've previously stated, I was never going to rush back to kabuki. The first and only trip was enough for me. However, about two months or so ago, I was invited to a lunch for a project I was on, and I hesitantly went. The lunch was back to back with a meeting I had... knowing this, and my issues last time, I arrived a half hour early with another coworker to make sure my order was in. We each ordered three rolls if I remember correctly. After we ordered, the others arrived (please note, it took a half hour to be able to put our order in... even though no one was in the restaurant).\n\nEveryone else began to put theirs in as well and sushi and other ordered items began to arrive. 20 more minutes passed and I soon realized everyone had their food but me. Even those that ordered after. It was now close to my time to leave so I flagged down our server and asked him if I could have my sushi to go. I wasn't extremely hungry, but knew I would be craving something by mid afternoon.\n\nIt all went downhill from here. Rather than checking on my order or anything else for that matter, I was attacked and accused of not putting an order down. After all, had it been, it obviously would've been at the table. After 5 minutes of several people ensuring him my order was on a list, I gave up and said to just bring me a philly roll quick so I can not starve myself. One of my coworkers graciously gave up his take home items so I could eat. I was ever thankful.\n\nI left angry and upset...but thanks to friends not completely starving. The food was good, but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here. Honestly the food is the only thing that gives them the 2nd star. I bitched on twitter about my disdain and soon had a message from their corporate office. They wanted to call me to discuss the matter with that locale. I told them I didn't really wish to speak with the locale. What's done is done. I wasn't sure what they could honestly say to make me feel better about how I was treated.\n\nKabuki responded with a rather generous gift card. I decided I would give them one more shot (after all, it was on the house). Honestly I was scared to use it... even with the meal being free, I wasn't sure I could handle the stress of another bad experience. It took me nearly a month to use it.\n\nThis past week, I returned and took with me the kind coworker who offered me their take home sushi. We made sure to go on a day where we didn't have any appointments immediately after lunch. We also arrived early. Once again, the place was practically empty. There were only 4 other people there. \n\nWe started off with drinks as we pondered the menu. The drinks my friends, are heavenly. I had a lychee mojito and an apple saketini and practically downed them in one gulp. Filled to the brim, tasteful and beautiful works of art they were. \n\nWe both ordered a few different items. I got two rolls and some nigiri. I was honestly shocked at the relatively ok speed at which they came out. We received our sushi about a half hour after ordering it. Still not super fast, but well, it's better than not getting it at all. The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious. My ebi nigiri came with a tempura shrimp in the shape of a bunny. That creeped me out a lot. Please don't do that.\n\nIn the end, the service is still slow enough and I've had so many bad experiences there, that I would not trust it for lunch. It will never be in my top 5 places to go at any point in time. However, if I end up arriving at Tempe Marketplace 3 hours early for an event, or if someone wants to go to grab a saketini, I will consider it. The only saving grace this establishment has is it's corporate office, a saketini, and decent sushi (once you get it).\n\nThere are rumors that my picture may be in the back of the restaurant as a warning for when I come in.... hopefully this is not the reason I had a slight improvement in service."
1,"This restaurant was just ok.  I got a gyro, and it was filling.  It was good but nothing special.  The service sucked.  I was in with a friend, and we were the ONLY people in the place.  I've waited tables, and I know you hold food so people have time to talk and get appetizers.  But seriously...we waited a half an hour.  And we specifically told the waitress we had one hour for lunch.  Not good.  Especially as there are a million other restaurants to chose from in the area..."
2,"the experience was fine - good wait staff, ambiance, etc.  on to the food:\n\nstarted with the Ricotta Ravioli which was solid, but not spectacular.  I guess I expected more, but who are we kidding - I came here for the steak, not the starter. \n\nsplit the Chateaubriand - the cut was (as usual) fantastic and the medium rare, while a bit overdone on the bottom, was still tender and delicious.  it was not over-salted or over-spiced, so the flavor of the cut really came through.  the roasted garlic was a great touch and added a great flavor.  these guys do steak proper - worth the price of admission.\n\nfor sides, the wild mushrooms were fine...and the mozzarella/whipped potato side is nothing to write home about.  don't get either...try some of the more adventurous sides (marrow, piquillo peppers).  \n\nin all, a fine meal.  but as a Chicagoan, a lot of folks can do the steak right...its the starters and the sides that really make a steakhouse stand out.  on both of these fronts, i either chose wrong or they just don't put too much into it."
1,"It's a \""UPS\"" store.... you bring in a package... they take it... you wave goodbye to it... you leave.\n\nSometime after that a big Brown Truck arrives and wisks said package off to its destination. \n\nThis UPS Store was unremarkable... the guy behind the counter did his job... nothing more nothing less."
1,"Took my mom for Mother's Day after seeing a show at Paris.  The popovers were outstanding.  Flaky, Cheesy, Salty Deliciousness.  We shared the Bone In Rib-eye which took almost 45 minutes to be served, and it was undercooked.  Although it was very flavorful, it was not a good cut of meat.  I am not sure if I have ever seen a tendon in the middle of a rib-eye, but this one had a large one running through it.  It was overall a fatty piece of steak.  The Bone In at Joe's is far superior for the same price.  The service was slow even though there were many servers present.  Did I mention the popovers were amazing?  Probably would  not go back."
1,I was not impressed.  My catfish tasted like some aquariums smell.
3,"I usually go here with coworkers every Wednesday (Wingsday) night after work. It is endless wings on Wednesday so you really can't get a better deal. I enjoy going and eating here because they have tons of T.V.'s playing and you can usually catch whatever game you want and ask a server to change a channel for you if you don't have the specific game you want to watch on. The food is good and fairly priced and you are also paying for the experience of eating at a Hooters. If you don't know what I'm talking about when I say \""experience\"" then you have clearly never been to a Hooters. The servers have always been really nice and easy on the eye's, so to speak. I have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Definitely recommended."
1,"This review is based solely on the restaurant portion of Tom's...  \n\nThis was my first visit to Tom's tonight as I stopped in for carry out on my way back into town.  I ordered 3 sandwiches (pulled pork, cuban, and brisket) and some potato salad.  I asked for an upgrade to my side since I didn't want the chips that came with my meal.  The girl was confused and said she could only do it if I ordered all of my sandwiches as \""lunch combos\"" and then the chips would become fries.  I agreed to the deal and asked for sweet potato fries.  I did get sticker shock when the bill came to $48 since it didn't seem like much more than a fast food operation. \n\nThe girl helping me told me she only worked there for a week and a half.  Although she did seem nice, she needed more training.  The other two girls behind the counter seemed very occupied socializing with each other.  Maybe they could have helped double check the order and shadow the new girl a little closer.   \n\nAs I was driving home I realized I didn't receive the three drinks that should have come with the \""lunch combo\"".  I was too far to return for the drinks.\n\nWhen I got home and opened the fries, they were all regular and not sweet potato.\n\nIt also seemed weird that my cold, non-insulated potato salad was put in the same bag as all of my hot BBQ.  Maybe I'm just being picky but seems like common sense.  The potato salad wasn't bad but seemed to be lacking something that would make it stand out from other average potato salads.   \n\nALL of the meat was VERY dry.  I had to really sauce it up to get it down.  Even my kids who were starving wouldn't eat the sandwiches.  Thank god for fries even if they weren't the right ones.  It's a shame because the brisket seasoning was tasty.  \n\nOn a positive note, the sauce was very good.  I tried about 4 different kinds and they were all above average.   \n\nI'm giving this place a 2 star rating instead of a 1 because I think there is potential to have a good meal and good service here.  Obviously they are having consistency issues or a bad weekend chef based on all the good reviews here."
3,Me and my wife enjoyed it very much!We got the Groupon and it was worth it.Very good food and nice atmosphere .We will be back for sure.
3,There is a special place in my heart for Dean & Deluca. This location is nestled close to my family's home so I come here pretty often with my mom.\n\nAt times can be pricey but you're in a D&D... \n\nAt the deli I usually split the turkey sandwich with avocado and alfalfa sprouts (HUGE) and split one of their salads too...heaven!\n\nSit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful Charlotte weather.
4,"This was my favorite Place on the strip. A nice chance. Plus a calming feeling in a city of constant noise and chaos. Even in the crowd, I felt I had my own experience here. Great place to shop, eat, visit, or play! Check it out."
0,"Not happy at all! They have a frequent user program that they screw you on because they can't keep track of how many times you've been there & refuse to give you a print-out or card to prove your visits. They've screwed my friend over two different times & refuse to correct it even though we are only talking about a few $'s. The service is slow as all get out. Took over 2 hrs to get a full set of nails put on. Don't go there. They lost 2 good customers today & they could care less! It's okay, there's nail salons all over the place."
1,"Average food. Lack presentation, ingenuity, and tasty. Taste like something I've picked up from a grocery store."
4,"Great place. As one reviewer said this is NOT a meat-market. Smart trainers, great use of space and allow you to get in and get out quick with 30 minute workouts. The trainers here don't rely on machine circuits like many other gyms. At Vitality you are using dumbbells, kettlebells, TRX, barbells, medicine balls and even flipping tires or hitting the heavybag. The owner is incredibly nice, and make sure to ask for Liz if you want a trainer who is high energy and will kick your butt!"
4,"A group of business partners and potential clients met for dinner at Comme Ca. I selected it for its $$$ rating, + the fact it was in the Cosmopolitan (for max impact) and solid meat menu.\n\nWe were not disappointed by the cool vibe of the Cosmopolitan. Walking through the entrance and all the way up to the restaurant made the impact I wanted - modern, musing, casual.  \n\nI had requested a seat with a view and indeed the view didn't disappoint. The vibe of Comme \u00c7a is a mix between fancy (decor, view, French menu) and casual (waiters in plaid Paul Bunyon attire).  Although the waiters were casual, the service was not.  The attention to detail is clearly important, and it was noticed and appreciated by my fellow diners.\n\nWe started with a round of East and West Coast Oysters and they were SUBLIME! I could have had an entire meal of Oysters if we hadn't already ordered our mains.  We also had a selection of  five cheeses, which was also lovely.\n\nMy fellow diners ordered and raved about the Lamb (fall off the bone - no knife required) Bone in steak, Skirt steak Frites, Beef Bourguignon, and Beef Stroganoff.  At one point all conversation stopped and for a few minutes in fact, no one spoke - just chewed, lip smacked, sighed and started again. \n\nThe wine list had some inexpensive options ($32 / bottle) that didn't disappoint either. And desert, although shared - the chocolate souffle with coffee was a perfect ending to a perfect dinner for all.\n\nLast year, we went to another (very lovely $$$$) restaurant and the difference in price at the end of the night was about $500 less - meaning more $ spent on other entertainment and a much easier expense report receipt for my business to accept."
3,"This 'bucks is right down the street from my house, so whenever I get a caffeine fix, I take a little walk to my local Starbucks. It does suck that this, Pei Wei and SideBar took over the fierce Emerald Lounge, but business is business. \nAnyway, in no time at all the staff knew my name and my drink. Does that mean I go there too much or they're just that good? I vote for the latter, and on top of it these guys know the right way to make my drink. I've tried to explain my drink to other baristas in other stores from Phoenix to LA to Vegas to San Francisco (jeez I visit Starbucks too much), and they never get it quite right. \nAlso the place is usually spotless, even when it's crowded, which makes for a great hang out spot. And unlike other Starbucks, it has a grassy lil area to make it feel more comfy!"
2,"I've been waiting to write this review because I've been hoping these issues would be worked out on their own - I truly believe they have a remarkable product. I've been to Nekter (this location) quite frequently since they opened and was an addict for the first few months. The Popeye Acai is my favorite, Date Nut is great, and the green Toxin cleanse is delicious as well. I also love the prepacked green juices and have tried the famous Acai bowls. \n\nThe product has been extremely inconsistent as of the last 3 months or so. The last 3 times I've been there the following occurred:\n\n1) Chunks of frozen banana (Popeye Acai)\n2) Chunks of some kind of tart/bitter powder (Popeye Acai)\n3) Pieces (lots) of pit from the Date Nut smoothie which rendered this smoothie un-drinkable unless I wanted to use a strainer. I'm assuming the hard rock like bits were pieces of pit.... \n \nThe last one was when I actually decided to call and tell them about what I've been experiencing. My hesitation was that I would call and the message would never make it to management... either way, I tried the phone number that came up on Google as well as the number listed directly on Yelp - first number seemed to be corporate office which was closed and the phone number to the store just didn't go through at all (was during store hours). Thus, I reluctantly resorted to Yelp. \n\nI love this product. Truly. And will be trying the North location from now. I will not return to Hilton Village."
3,"There is no doubt this place is beautifully breathtaking,  but the catering is little to be desired.  We attended the Military Ball last night and the venue definitely set the stage.  The venue gets 5 stars.  My only issue was the food.  It was terrible.  I felt like I was eating dog food. Beef tips on rice with bland potatoes and green beans... When you think beef tip for a fancy sit down dinner you expect more than 3 pieces of smaller then bite size beef. I definitely was not happy."
2,"My one pet peeve about some \""shi shi\"" restaurants are snooty patooty hosts and hostesses.  Our party did not feel welcomed at all by the hostess (who said we'd have to pay $7 per plate for a surprise birthday cake we tried to bring in) and who looked at us like we were paupers.\n\nOnce we got past Cruella DeVil, I ordered a Lycheetini from the bar.  Loved it and would've ordered more but wanted to save room for the food.\n\nWe were escorted into an elevator which took us up to the restaurant.  I was impressed by the modern Asian decor.  Our waiter and bussers was very attentive and never was a sake glass empty.  I ordered their special California roll, freshwater eel roll, and adobo chicken roll.  The food was good, but the atmosphere and ambiance is what you pay for.\n\nBased on the lumpia, pancit, and adobo on the menu, I assume the chef is Filipino.  One of the staff asked if I was related to the chef.  Didn't know all Filipinos were related.  \n\n\nThe restaurant lives up to its name.  The Social House is the perfect place to spend time with friends, enjoy some authentic sushi, and get tipsy on good sake.  If they would only get rid of the snotty hostesses."
2,"We had a good lunch here today. My biggest disappointment was the little pepper icon that let you know if a meal is supposed to be hot/spicy really let me down. My Red Curry Chicken was delicious, but a pretty mildly spiced curry sauce. It had zucchini and probably a whole onion worth of onion. No complaints at $5 with a tea, spring roll and fried rice. This was our first trip here and seems like a decent lunch stop if you're planning on getting groceries at Harris Teeter or the Walmart and don't want to shop on an empty stomach.  \nTheir menu had plenty of choices that peaked our interest, but i'm guessing the $5 General Tso's is next on my list. If we do come back for dinner, i'll finally get to use that coupon in the Entertainment book."
1,"We met family from out of town here to eat (since that's where they wanted to go). I've had better, it wasn't awful... but I'm not inclined to go back.\n\nBest things I had:\n\n1) mini carrot cake complete with cream cheese frosting, it was nicely spice and how carrot cake is supposed to be.\n\n2) peel and eat cold shrimp and snow crab legs. The crab was sweet, the shrimp were nicely flavored. They both tasted fresh and not fishy.\n\n3) fresh fruit the melon, strawberries and pineapple were all juicy and flavorful.\n\nMediocre things:\n1) steamed veggies....they were a little on the soggy side.\n\n2) tiramisu cup, there was hardly any lady finger in it :( that's the best part!\n\n3) cappuccino mouse, very rich....but a lot of clear brownish fluid was in a pocket in it....not sure if it just wasn't mixed good or what?\n\n4) black beans, they're kind of hard to screw up :)\n\nCould have been okay but.....\n\n1) Chili Relleno. The cheese filling was good, but there was wayyyyy too much breading on it which did nothing but retain too much grease....if there would have been less breading and not as greasy this would have fallen in the category above.\n\n2)peanut butter cream puff. Dry, kind of defeats a \""cream\"" puff.\n\nYuck:\n\n1) crab salad....I don't know if it was imitation crab meat, or old crab... but this was fish and gross...the crab was also rubbery.\n\n2) California roll, ewww gross. I actually spit this out into my napkin. It was so fishy it made me gag a little before I spit it out!\n\n3) mac n cheese pretty bland and gooey....I think maybe they made it with generic velveta?\n\nSo, that's the run down of what I ate, about all I could fit in my tummy. So, in my opinion stick to the peel and eat shrimp and crab :) Not sure about the other meats because I don't eat it.....my hubby said they were okay, not the best, not the worst. He pretty much agrees with me on the \""Meh. I've experienced better\"""
0,"First time in this WoB. From 9 attempts, 8 beers were sold out. Finally I found a beer from Poland which was in stock. I asked the bartender to see the bottle and later I realized the best before date was expired. (I told the server that it was expired, but no reaction from her)\n\nAfter drinking 3/4 of the beer (1 hour later), I felt very bad in my stomach and asked for water and a slice of bread. I got my water, but the server said that she would have to charge me for bread. So I took the cab back and my friends continued partying that night. \n\nWe all ate 6 hours ago the same kind of sub at subway and I was the only one feeling very bad. \n\nI'm German, so I am sorry for my non native English."
3,"i work at the hospital at sunrise and im always here to eat there great food! good variety of food, but my favorite is there philly cheesteak special! i always order from then and i like how they deliver too becuase sometimes i cant make it there so i order to go! deliveries are so much easir for me tho! love it"
0,"i will never go back to this place!  terrible service!!! here is what got me; we ordered a 2nd round 10 min. before happy hour was to end only to have the lazy and terrible server come over and asked if we wanted another round.  we politely reminded him that we ordered the round prior for the happy hour special.  he slowly brought us our drink and when we got our bill... guess what? we were not charged the correct price.  he used the excuse that the computer did it and that he couldn't change it.  we again reminded him that if he had brought us our drinks in a timely manor the computer would not have charged us more.  he then said he'd buy us one of the glasses.  what a jerk! please it isn't coming out of your pocket, do your job correctly!  so here is my take, this place is a copy cat of many others.  go to the places with great service and spend your money there. don't waist your time here with these rude people!"
0,"I have on three occasions purchased a half-gallon of The Sassy Cow Organic 2% milk at a local retail market here in Chicago. On each occasion, regardless of the expiration date being well in the future, and in this case August 13, the milk is sour by the time I get 1/3 way through it. I have purchase many other brands of milk both organic and non, at this market and at others. I have never had this problem. I don't intend to waste more money on this product. It is clearly not properly produced or stored. Again, never happened with other dairy's products at this store, only with Sassy Cow. And 100% of the time, I had to throw out most of it within a few days."
4,"My favorite holiday happens to be Halloween & for my current job we also have a lot of different occasions where we have to dress up. This store is spectacular when it comes to customer service & they seem to have just about everything! It also makes it a pleasure to shop there since they really do have a little black cat roaming around who is extremely friendly. Definitely THE place to go if you need any make up, costumes, gag gifts, & accessories. The owners are a pleasure as well!"
3,"This is a fantastic little (and it IS little) restaurant. It's French, so of course the wine will be good. \n\nWe had escargots (12 of them!) & the anti-pasta plate for starters. Followed by the beef bourguignon and trout, then a cheese plate for dessert. All very civilized and delicious.\n\nI highly recommend this place. Give it a try should you happen to be in the area, or make a special trip - I think it's worth it."
4,"When that craving for some food from the island hits, there's no escaping it.\n\nIt's a hunger like no other. Luckily, over at Island Flavor, they give some of the largest portions that I have ever seen. It's like Hash House A Go Go-portions for Hawaiian Cuisine, except the food here is actually good.\n\nThe place was a bit on the empty side around 11am on a late Saturday morning. Seeing an empty place on a weekend always leaves me a bit hesitant to eat somewhere. But, I had a gut instinct telling me to eat here anyway. I'm glad I did. Here's what we went with:\n\nFried Rice Omelet - When this dish is served to you, it looks like a majestic mountain pile, capped at the peak with a generous amount of scrambled egg. Along with it, comes three giant pieces of Portuguese sausage, nestled around the edges of the plate. The fried rice, packed underneath, has to be some of the best fried rice that I've ever had in this town. It had a bit of a unique sweet flavor to it, mixed in with some small bits of diced pork. I'm pretty sure this serving was good enough to feed 3-4 people. I stared at this modern marvel for a few seconds before I dug in. It was beautiful sight.\n\nLoco Moco - Another heavily portioned dish with a likewise amount of brown gravy, to boot. I sampled a bit of it. Not bad! the hamburger patty included with it was humongous, as expected. Loco Moco is much too heavy a dish for me to conquer on my own. I'd probably come back for this if I wanted to drown a day of depression in gravy.\n\nHuge portions, great flavors, friendly staff.. there's isn't much more I could want in a restaurant."
0,I was having a problem with my shoulder and someone suggested going to Arrowhead. He performed an ultrasound and told me I had a torn rotator cuff and a torn bicep tendon. They sent me to an ultrasound meanwhile it has been 6 weeks and they have not taken any action not even to call me about my MRI. I had to go to another position get another MRI and he diagnosed me with something completely different my suggestion is find a different place to go I could not even schedule an appointment before two weeks the doctor is two weeks out that's not very good when your shoulder hurts
4,Awesome resort and fabulous water park!  Great for the family!
1,"My husband (bf at the time) and I were visiting my brother in Vegas. My husband was in a dire need of a cheap haircut so my brother suggested the nearest Great Clips by Vons near Durango Ave. and Warm Springs Ave.\n\nThe lady who had handled the front was the one who took care of him. She seemed a bit rushed and annoyed. Immediately started shaving the back of his hair not really paying much attention to what he wanted cut.  Didn't even bother to shave the hair on his neck From what my husband told me, it would have cost extra? I could have done a more thorough job myself and it would have been free! \n\nFirst and last time he'll ever go there."
3,"Nice place. Alert and friendly staff, fun people,darts, billiards and sports on screen. Also very clean.  \nBeen twice. I live in Glendale so driving is an issue. Took a taxi over a month ago because I assumed they would be showing the ufc fights. No such luck, sports bar anyone?\nWas a fun night anyway with beer, darts and conversation. Would definately go back."
2,"This place is cool, not only cause the name, but the hours. The food's pretty good, ordered pho and you can get extra broth for just $1. The service is alright, like any other mom and pop asian place. We had a problem with our check and the man was being very rude about it. I'm sure there are numerous large parties that come through the restaurant and want to split checks or pay partial cash, partial card. The man was just being very impatient and fussy and the funny part is they weren't even busy at the time, he was probably just having a bad day. The prices are reasonable too and the food is good. But this is the place to be after a long night of partying or to cure your hangover in the morning!"
4,"I was looking for a great family spring break activity and I found it!   We are not experienced riders and were not looking for an all day adventure, the 1.5 hour ride proved to be just the right amount of time. Great scenery, great horses, very nice staff...just a great all around experience. \n\nOur cowboy, Dave, was really good at pointing out local history, flowers, etc. and was very patient with my 9 and 12 year old children."
2,"Well, with all the hype I had to go to Hakkasan. Unless you are down to drop a couple grand, this is not gonna be such a sweet experience. I went when Calvin Harris was performing. First, Harris is extremely overrated. I've been to plenty shows, and I can confidently say Calvin Harris is not even in my top 10. Second, the venue itself is classy, but it's kind of a maze and the dance floor is freaking tiny. Surprisingly, the drinks were not that expensive for Vegas. I should have listen to my pals and gone to XS. Oh, well. I needed to experience it myself. Definitely not going back, though. The lasers are badass, however. One of the best equipment I've seen."
1,"Pros - inexpensive, large portions, the cheese puffs or crab ragoon as we call them at home were awesome!! If I go back, that's the only thing I'll order.  These rice was not edible....\n\nCons - food was so/so; just average.  It was quick and easy."
3,"We've some stuff on the menu - burgers, a wrap, onion rings, fries, etc- and it was all fairly mediorce, but reasonably priced at around 7-8 bucks for dinner.  \n\nBut hey - the hot wings here are amazing.  No complaints.  They're perfect.  ORDER THE WINGS!!!"
4,"If you have never been on a Segway before, you need to make that a priority. This is actually not an opinion; it's a fact. I have been to Comtemporide several times now with family and friends.  \n\nComtemporide's location in Old Town Scottsdale makes it a perfect place to travel around. There are so many great sites to see and the best part is, you can see so much of the city, because you can travel anywhere (sidewalks or streets) and can travel up to 13 mph!\n\nIt was great for my family (who have done it the last two times they have been in town to visit me), because my dad does not do well walking long distances, but my mom likes to see all of the shops. This was a GREAT compromise.\n\nThis last Saturday I went with my father and uncle. My father insisted that we ride them again and my uncle has never been on one before. My uncle was not excited about going, but after the first ten minutes, he enjoyed it so much, I spend the next two hours trying to catch up with him. \n\nHere are my observations:\n\n1. Everyone thinks they must be hard to ride. But the truth is, it only takes 2-3 minutes to get comfortable on them, and after your first 10 minutes, you want to be Evil Knievel.\n\n2. Everyone first thinks that they wouldn't like to ride them, but everyone walks away with a great appreciation of the exciting technology. Some people like the thrill of the ride, others might be the convenience of travel.\n\n3. People think the Segways look weird when you drive them, but after you drive one yourself, normal people walking around will look weird to you!\n\nTake a risk and try a Segway, you'll love it. It's a fact!"
2,"Easy to schedule and they are the few shops that's open at weekends. \nTheir $50 special of oil change, tire rotation and wiper change is a good deal. Other than that it's pretty similar to other shops. \nLong wait sometimes. An hour wait for an oil change"
0,"This place was just ok. The bests parts were lounging by the pool and the restaurant was excellent!\n\nThere were several disappointments though:\n\n- I was hoping to read on the rooftop in the morning, but they were doing construction on it (Saturday and Sunday morning, starting before 7am!). It woke us up and also caused power flickers/outages across the hotel. We never got to enjoy the rooftop, and weren't told about the construction when we checked in.\n\n- The $20 per night service fee wasn't exactly as promised. We learned that you have to explicitly ask at the front desk for everything that fee covers and they'll give it to you, if they have it...\n\n- Part of the fee covered sunscreen, which would have been great for the pool! They didn't have any though. When they run out they should get more, sunscreen would make trips to their pool so much better!\n\n- According to their web site the fee was also supposed to include a $20 gift card (per night) towards a future stay, but we didn't get it. I called the hotel to ask and they said they don't do that anymore. I left a message for the owner (at the same number) and within minutes the hotel called me back. Further proof that you really do need to ask for everything the service fee promises. I took a star off for this, but I'll give it back if the actually send me a gift card. Update: they said I could remind them next time and they'd take $20 off. Fail! I'm taking another star off, and I won't be staying here again.\n\n- The cheaper rooms overlook the pool, which is open 6am-midnight. The pool guests were pretty quiet, but the elevator music for the pool was not! We could hear it loud and clear in our room. Oddly enough I didn't even notice it when we were at the pool.\n\n- We booked through hotels.com, which said the hotel had microwaves in the rooms. Not true."
1,"I went to eat here on the opening weekend. \n\nThe wait to eat here was about a good 20-30 minutes. It was expected on the opening weekend.\n\nOur server was the main problem here. He constantly would forget things we requested. Also, it seemed like he forgot about our table. It took 15 minutes to get a refill. It took another 15 minutes to get a side of horseradish. It took 30 minutes to get our bill. It took another 30 minutes for him to charge our bill.\n\nThe food itself was actually pretty decent for a casino cafe. I had the chicken ciabatta with a cup of french onion soup. Presentation on the dishes was also more than you'd expect from a cafe. Typical meals range from $8-15\n\nOverall, the whole cafe experience was 2 hours. I'd expect to be in and out in less than half the time, since we all just ordered sandwiches. We got to our table at 10pm, left it at midnight.\n\nDecent food, atrocious service."
1,"So, for the atmosphere I would rate it higher, drinks weren't bad and can have a lot of fun with it! The food was less than good but the fiance loved it. He does however like his burgers dry. I would say go for the experience, but not for the food and we had to asked to be spanked, so that took away from it a little...."
3,"Another great place to stop by while trolling the Las Vegas Strip.  If you ever wondered where you could buy Coca-Cola inspired clothing, including shirts, hoodies, pants and boxers, this is your spot!\n\nOn the second floor, there is a cafe where you can order different flavors of Coke.  I was tempted to try the different flavors from around the world, but didn't have the time.  I'll try this out on my next visit to Vegas."
1,"I would have given it four stars when I first came here several years ago but several years later I can't give it four stars.  We came here for lunch which was $23 and while $23 isn't expensive for buffet at the Wynn, the restaurant lacked variety, creativity, and change.  After eating at Wicked Spoon which charges $27 for dinner one would think the Wynn would offer something spectacular.  The display of the food was boring, the variety was non existent and the taste of the food wasn't very good.  For example the pad thai didn't taste like a pad thai, the turkey was way too dry, the clam chowder looked like goo, and the only thing that was half way decent was the ice cream.  \n\nThis buffet was once the best buffet on the strip but it got complacent.  It's like an athlete who made it to the big leagues and then decided he or she didn't need to work out, train, or just get better.  I don't know if the dinner would be better but lunch wise it was kind of like buffets in Reno."
4,"One of the best stores and optometrists I have ever been to. The store is very clean and open, there is plenty of seating available while you wait, that is, even if you have to wait. The service is quick and if you have any questions, there is always an attendant to answer. Their pricing on their frames are very affordable, and their insurance policy is great, they accept all insurances and help you get through everything step by step.\n\nThe staff at Spring Mount Vision is astronomical, especially the doctor, one in particular. Dr. Kevin Diep one of the most polite doctors I've met. He makes sure you understand everything that is going on and any problems that you may have. His sense of humor is quite entertaining once you become a regular.\n\nOverall, this store is great for vision check-ups, or just to buy those new designer glasses/sunglasses you've always wanted. I would recommend this store and staff to anyone looking for an eye doctor."
2,"This particular Albertson's is one of the bigger & better stores in my area.  Up in the North East area, we have slim pickin's when it comes to grocery stores & restaurants.  When my husband and I can't make it to Whole Foods, we buy our groceries here.  The produce is usually pretty good depending on what's in season.  We really like their fresh bread selection & the guys at the meat case are always really nice.  Albertson's discontinued their shopper's card program, so the prices are what you see is what you get."
0,"DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ORGANIZATION! They don't have animals' best interest in mind. My girlfriend and I found a really sweet stray dog we are currently fostering, and asked if they could help us network him to find him a home. Not only did they say no, they said they wouldn't help solely because he looks to be a chow mix. We told them that we would pay for his expenses and provide shelter, but they still turned us down without even meeting him! To top it all off, the woman we spoke with(Tracey Varga) was incredibly rude. What a disgusting and uncaring organization!\n\nUPDATE!!\n\nApparently they \""do not discriminate against any breeds\""... the email we received says differently. I've posted a picture of said email. We found a permanent home for the little guy this afternoon. So much for him being \""hard to adopt\"" huh? Choose carefully which organizations you support, folks. There are plenty of very helpful shelters which don't rudely shut down people trying to help."
0,"This was our second stay at Encore and between the 2 visits, we've eaten at over a half dozen restaurants in the Wynn and/or Encore.  This was the only disappointment!  What a shame because it has so much potential and there is no excuse for such a mediocre execution at such an establishment.  I had the alfredo with shrimp and it resembled and tasted like a tv dinner!  I could have had better at The Olive Garden!  It was smothered with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms and was just bad-period.  My bf had the Philly cheesesteak and that too was a disaster.  How can you mess up a hot sandwich?  Th only decent thing we had was the salad caprese, which was actually good.  What a waste of $ and the nice pool view!"
3,We came here to play black jack and had one great dealer who kept us entertained each time he was at our table. Very nice place and good music ! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it was a pain trying to order drinks while gambling. The cocktail girls weren't on top of it! Slow!
0,Just nothing good to say. Grilled salmon and grilled veggies swimming in oil and the salmon was burnt. Server never ask if ever how it was. I guess I shouldn't leave out that the rice tasted like it had been sitting around in a warmer for days.
1,I like the fish tacos and have ordered them several times before. But today I stopped by to place an order and was completely ignored. The person at the front desk just kept speaking Spanish to someone who worked there and never made eye contact. I left without ordering.
4,"I usually don't drink much sweet drinks, but the boba tea here is an exception. The staff is super friendly, it is very clean, and they even have food. (I tried the Crab Rangoon and it is delicious!) They have a great variety of different teas. They taste natural, and fresh. Definitely, a must go."
1,"A little bummed.  I expected more from this place.  It's been around forever and one of those places you've heard is solid.  One of those places I was embarrassed I hadn't tried yet because it's been around for so long!\n\nI've been on a Greek food kick lately so I was craving some grape leaves.  Recently I've had some really awful grape leaves at the Arts Fest (I know, what was I thinking!) and some really awesome ones at another festival that has a strong Greek heritage in the community.  I like chilled grape leaves that are tightly wound.  The grape leaves here are loosely wound and a tad on the  mushy side.  The really awful ones I had were super mushy and unedible.  These were still good, had an okay lemon flavor, but they were served warm and I felt like they may not have been marinated long enough.  Not impressed\n\nI also ordered the Tabbouli which had WAY too much parsley and not enough of the goodstuff... onions and tomatoes.  It also said it came with fresh warm pita bread.  I did not get that pita bread.  Which brings me to my next point...\n\nThe server was miserable.  From start to finish I knew she did not want to be there.  Serving to me is fakin' it til you make it!  You gotta work for that tip... I mean, if you're a server you usually have to have some kind of personality, right?  Even if she did, it was not her day.  I think that's why I did not get my pita bread.  \n\nHonestly, not having the best experience, I don't know if I'd be back."
2,"Good:\n-Clean rooms, attentive house keeping. We called multiple times for towels and they were there instantly\n-Great for kids and family\n-Cheap rooms\n-Ample parking\n-Good Gaming. \n\nCould use work \n-check-in slow\n-parking, although ample, is a pain to get around.\n-place needs some touch up paint, very faded in areas. \n-signage is confusing\n\nBottom line, clean cheap room on the strip. Good deal."
3,"I have been to Brio many times at Town Square and once at Tivoli.  Tonight the service was so so, but the food was the star again.  This time I had the steak salad.  Often times restaurants just \""phone it in\"" on steak salad, but this one was fantastic.  I asked for medium and it was cooked perfectly, very well seasoned meat.  I asked for no pecans and asked for the creamy parmesan dressing instead of the horseradish.  In my opinion, it is THE BEST dressing there.  I will always enjoy a visit to Brio."
1,"I wanted to like this place; especially since it's down the street from my house- but I can't. As soon as a pulled-in I knew I wanted a mid-level wash but no sooner than I put in my request the attendant tried to upsell me like crazy. I went inside to pay for and wait for my car to be finished; little did I know that it would be nearly 40 minutes before I got my car back! UGH!!! Once my car was finally ready, as soon as I jumped in I noticed they did a half butt job on the vacuuming (for Pete sakes I could still easily see a French fry stuck between the seats-smh!). I'm willing to give this place another try only because I just got a coupon in a Money Mailer  but they better be faster or at least thoroughly clean my car if it is going to take that long."
3,"Went in a group of friends trying to find a non-mournful strip place that was full of life.  This was it!  Double-powered drinks for $12 and really hot ladies that didn't have bullet scars or terrible tattoos.  I had a real clingy lady sit down on me in the middle of talking with my friends, a real rude one.  But that was the outlier in the crowd of amazing women.  Good times.  \n\nWas amused by the idea of the steakhouse.  Who eats classy at a strip joint?"
1,"Are you kidding me with the salt?  Ordered the steak main course with side of fries.  Could not believe how salty it was....\n\nEnjoyed the oysters the most.  But even with this, found bits of shell in my last oyster. \n\nToo much hype.  Was an early fan but, for what you pay for, not going back.."
3,"Family of 4 went there for dinner tonight. Staff was friendly and the food came out pretty quickly even though they were very busy. I had the shrimp burrito, while the rest of the family got the carne asada burrito. Mine was delicious and my family enjoyed their burritos. We also tried the carne asana nachos, which were excellent. The chips were homemade and very good. All in all a good experience and we'll be back. Only complaint I had, which is not at all the owners fault, was the family with 5 kids too many. If you're going to take your family out to dinner and bring your small children be courteous of those around you. Parents were too busy talking to each other to notice their kids running around screaming in the restaurant. So rude! If you can't control your children in a public place, stay home!!"
4,"Yes, please!\n\nLove In & Out. \n\n#2 Animal Style is like sex."
4,"I can only say that if Payard was in my neighborhood, I'd have to get a part-time job to afford how much I would spend there!\n\nPayard is not easy on the wallet, but if you can get past that, it is a treat to eat at, or pick something up to go.  My wife and I ate there for breakfast two days in a row, not counting stopping in for a snack (best ice cream sandwiches EVER...see below), and for cookies at their express place in the casino.\n\nThe breakfast sandwiches are first class.  My favorite was the Salmon Croque Monsieur...delicately smooth, smoked salmon and cream cheese between luxuriously buttered pieces of bread.  Very rich, but very delicious.\n\nAnother favorite mentioned in reviews regularly, was the almond croissant.  We had it both at room temp and toasted.  I liked hot, my wife liked it better not.  It was really a tremendous pastry either way...ask for it how you like it!\n\nOur favorite items there were the ice cream sandwiches...At $5 a pop, we had $20 worth in one sitting.  I know that sounds gluttonous, and maybe it was...but they came in 4 flavors and we weren't leaving without trying them all...and it was money well spent.\n\nThe magic is that these are two French macarons, about 4-5 inches long, with boldly flavored, creamy textured ice cream in between.  Perfect bite, after perfect bite.\n\nThere's a Payard in NYC's Soho neighborhood...It has already been mentally bookmarked for my next trip there!"
1,"Tried this place a couple of times too many. It's just not that great. Pizza, salads, garlic knots... none of it stands out. Wouldn't try it again even for free. Much better places out there."
4,"These guys are GREAT. Randy called and asked if he could show up a bit early and he was very nice, professional and did an amazing job cleaning our carpet. He even helped me move the furniture since my husband hadn't made it home. We have 2 young kids and 2 dogs that have done a number on the carpet and our floors have never looked better! The price was very reasonable. We will def be using them again for our carpet and tile."
0,"If you want your feet to even be somewhat smooth, do not go here. Their $25 pedicure is merely a polish change and hot water soak."
1,"Used to like coming here when Market Street had a line (as it so often does) but it's getting harder to find something to order.  The hamburger steak used to be reliably good but this time, it was ... off.  I suspect it is due to whatever was cooked on the grill before they cooked the hamburger patties.  The philly steak sandwich wasn't too good either.  Not enough cheese and the meat kind of tasteless - needed salt.  Was so disappointed we didn't go back for the friend wonton and teri beef, which are our usual standbys."
0,Dinner took 45 min to arrive despite few customers in the restaurant.  How long are you willing to wait? Staff kept saying it would be ready soon. Will think twice before going there again.
1,"Every time i come here my experience is less than satisfying.. I don't know if its the fact that this place is trying to be urban and hip, but instead it's a bunch of overpriced stores and pretentious restaurants. \n\nThe parking -1, I mean what the hell was the person thinking who design this place, parking is confusing and people try run down the back of your ass to get passed you to park.. I mean why are u in such a hurry though? calm all the way down!\n\nThe vibe. -1 . umm there wasn't a vibe to speak of, yeah some people were dinning and out and about walking around but most of the mall seemed dead. \n\nPeople -1 Pretentious.. like let me valet my honda accord so I look super cool kind of pretentious LOL .. \n\nHonestly the only good thing here is the Apple Store, I love the design and the customer service is friendly whenever I've been there. H&M's men section sucks, and The Nike Store is overpriced like SHIT..\n\nyup I will try to avoid coming here in the future.. Fashion Square, hell even Kierland is a better option. MUCH BETTER VIBES\n\n2 LONELY STARS."
3,"Wow, what a great Mexican place! The most amazing collection of sauces I've ever seen. Their homemade sauce was enough though, the food is very tasty, and the price is certainly right. Fish tacos FTW!"
1,"Ok this was my third try and the last.  The first two times I went for pho at lunch.  Both times the service was abysmal (nobody is going to convince me I should have to wait 20 min for pho) and my pho ga was MEH (I believe that was beef broth in my ga-LAZY).  \n\nThis time I got crispy rolls and BBQ pork vermicelli and the service was markedly improved.  The crispy rolls were the best I have ever had and I loved the fresh fixings that came with them.  I love spicy food but found it odd that their fish sauce is spicy.  I've eaten at lots of Vietnamese places in silicon valley and the fish sauce was always sweet.  \n\nThe pork was severely overcooked.  Most pieces were the consistency of jerky; some were so hard I couldn't tear them in half with my fingers. \n\nIf this is authentic Vietnamese, I'll take the Americanized version where my fish sauce is sweet and the meats are tender and juicy, thank you very much!"
0,Horrible company that lies to employees and withholds pay without any communication or reason. The people who are suppose to support you jump to conclusions. \n\n\nDon't work here unless u want to make 60% of what you earn.
4,"Simply the BEST! I've been coming here for years now after researching their good reviews & they have NEVER let me down. Don & Janet take good care of my car that's getting old & falling apart. Thank you Brake Masters for being the most honest mechanics in Vegas! In the past 2 years I have taken my car to them for Brakes & they have told me I don't need brakes yet instead of ramming me & saying I do. When I got my front finally done they sd u have awhile before u need back brakes. Today we dropped my car off for a check engine light & they cld & said a minor issue, gave me estimate n had my car ready within the hour. A minor repair at minor cost because they're HONEST!"
3,"I am a Chicagoan. Not the suburbs of Chicago, but the heart of the city. There are a number of things I miss about my city: Garrett's popcorn, neighbood festivals every weekend, Lou Malnati's pizza and of course my family.....not necessarily in that order. When someone says they have Chicago-style pizza I feel it is my duty to try it. There are a bunch of pizza places in Chicago that have amazing pizza and they all do it differently so there isn't just way one to make Chicago-style pizza, but Spinato's came pretty damn close. \n\nWe ordered the Chicago-style with 1/2 mushroom for my man. The mixture of yellow and red bell pepper was a nice touch, most places use green bell peppers. The sauce was a bit on the sweet side, I'm not used to that. The pizza was not greasy, had the right amount of cheese and toppings and the cornmeal crust reminded me of home. \n\nI'm happy to say that Spinato's lived up to the hype."
0,"I  decided to stop in and see what this place was all about, after reading the positive reviews about the naan bread being the best in the city.\nLet me start by saying that the restaurant is completely ghetto which in my mind works in its favour, but not only is the decor ghetto the sanitary conditions are horrible. The table cloths haven't been washed in weeks, the floors look like they haven't been washed in days and the glasses don't really get washed more then they get dipped in dirty soapy water. My advice is to drink from the can and don't have water.\n\nThe service was O.K. it's a family place so it's more like eating in someones home where the family member were in the kitchen. This was kind of fun but unfortunately I felt like I was disturbing the waiter.\nI ordered combo C which included samosas, chicken korai, rice, salad and naan. The samosas came quickly, maybe a little too quickly the outside was hot and the inside was stone cold. The chicken came out of the kitchen shortly after with the rice the salad and the naan.\nThe chicken was very good and the rice was very good. The salad on the other hand was disappointing iceberg lettuce with Kraft Italian dressing not what I would call appetizing. The naan bread that was described as being the best in the city. I have to disagree, don't get me wrong it's good but I've had as good or better.\nThis being said, it's hard to beat the price. My combo meal cost me $12 including a soft drink, but I can't say I'll be back, I can't get past the cleanliness issue. I like the ghetto feel but in my mind it should still be clean."
0,I will give zero star if I can. Bad service. Dim sum is just so so. Rice noodle is the worst I ever have in the restaurants----a few and very very short noodle and 3 fish balls (which  taste like the one I buy in any market).
4,Been going here for years all you can eat at the top of line sushi and are the chefs here fast the service is great
1,I went into this location when it was not busy and wondered trying to ask a question. When I found someone I walked up they looked at me and I smiled and the two workers looked down ignoring me continuing their conversation. I said hello a few times and they sighed and continued talking until they finally after 2 minutes assisted me. \n\nI like polite people I will definitely try to find another store that is kinder!
1,"Ordered Cadillac Margaritas, and I think they were all margarita mix with no tequila for $7. Way too sweet. They were running a special on shots of Jose for $2, so we bought a couple to add to our drinks to cut the sweetness. Note, their \""shots\"" are maybe an ounce. Much too small to be acutal shots. We ordered their nachos, and they were HUGE! Definitely the highlight with lots of good toppings. No way the 2 of us were finishing them (although we gave it a good run). We were supposed to have gotten a $2 discount on the nachos with our Total Rewards card, which we didn't get. I didn't notice until later though, and I didn't feel like going back and arguing about $2. All-in-all, it's an OK place, but years ago I remember the drinks were great and I'd spend hours hanging out there. Now? Not so much."
0,"Stopped in with the fiance and parents for dinner last night.... \n\nWow, in the worst possible way, just wow!\n\nThe food was the same as always... but I would recommend not getting the Small One, burger isn't big enough to get enjoy the flavor. \n\nThe service, if that is what you can call it was horrid! My mouth was agape most of the evening in disbelief. \""Did she just do that?\"" Was pretty much my thinking. First my mothers wine glass was disgustingly dirty, never should have been brought to the table. They when she asked for a new one and pointed out how dirty it was the bartender looked at it like \""Umm looks fine to me..\"" and just wanted away. We watched her put the glass back on the rack with the other \""clean\"" glasses and grab another one. She didn't inspect it to make sure it was clean before handing it off, this one was just as dirty and had lipstick all over it. Me being a bartender asked for a rocks glass, figuring they would be cleaner and less lipstick, she handed me a shot glass. WHATEVER I took it and gave it to my mom. Once she finally came back to the table we pointed out the hideousness of the second wine glass and in the same fashion, probably more irritated, inspected it said \""Okay?!\"" walked back behind that bar and put it back on the shelf. Are you kidding me?!?! Were we being punked? Ridiculous! \n\nLike I said, the food was good, but the service was out outrageous! I hope they read this and get their shit under control. The behavior is unacceptable for a McDonald's. \n\nI am sure we will go back someday, but if she is there, I will leave, if not I will stay but make sure to only order beer in a bottle, no glassware!"
2,"Food is fine. Same as any other McDonalds. Clean as any other McDonalds. \nParents: the play area sucks. For very young, under 2 theres a toddler slide and an area to put some balls in a hole. Ok for little ones. Anyone else it's just a caged area with 2 balls. Really not fun for anyone over 2. Go to a different play place with the towering playground and slides.\nBut on the positive my 2 yr old was bored enough to eat all her chicken nuggets, so that's something."
4,"This place usually serves restaurants and depanneurs but anyone can go in; no membership required and the selection and quality are better than any crummy Costco. Shop with your room mates or with a bunch of friends and save yourselves a bundle. Even if you just want to purchase small quantities of certain items for yourself it's worth the trek. Best buys are cheeses, pasta, cereal, spices, anything you can think of for a party and frozen stuff including pasta and veggies. For canners and pickles it's a paradise. I can't believe it took me so long to write a review of this place - it is, quite simply, the hidden gem of St-Henri."
0,"Quality Garage Doors was originally sent us by our home warranty company.  The first trip to our house was good until last week when our garage wouldn't open. After investigating it had not been calibrated. Called company back and they said they would fix it no charge. They advised they would come out this Saturday from 12pm-4pm. My fianc\u00e9 waited and waited. Finally started calling them several times starting around 3pm as we were getting concerned. No one answered, kept getting voice recording although it says they are supposed to be open till 4:30pm. Like you, our time is valuable especially around the holidays. We wasted an afternoon waiting on this company just to be no showed."
4,"OMeGoodness!! The food was fantastic, but what will I be coming back for???\n\nTheir Iced Coffee with sweetened condensed milk\n&\nTheir tapioca with plantains and coconut milk... \n\nI have pregnancy cravings (without the pregnancy part) and some days I just neeeed these. I bought the coffee at Lee Lees, but I cant recreate the brewing process... I have told everyone about this place! \n\nAgain... Food = FANTASTIC\nBBQ platter\nLemongrass beef\nAmok fish... All fantastic!"
0,"Have been coming here since they opened. They Have slowly cut back on lots of things,But now the Buffett is not the same in the am it is served out of 5-7 warming plates in the coffee shop , smaller options for food but price did not go down!!!!! Will not be going back to the m."
3,"The service was great and the server was informative and amusingly enthusastic about the food, especially the appetizers.  For a fancy place the prices were unexpected, meaning lower than I expected due to the fanciness.  ie - dry aged steak for $25"
4,had a pedi and gel mani done today! absolutely will be coming back :) everyone was so nice and the prices are perfect. \nvery very clean as well!
3,"It looks like The Cupcakery http://www.yelp.com/biz/rOqY1Vj8sQ6kL9XLVQRslw?hrid=uAzjdVfA6_GBBfK2cuhwrA over in Henderson might have some competition in the world of fancy cupcakes!\n\nOpening up only a week and a half ago, word is that Cupcake Lane Bakery has a franchise in mind.  I spotted this little store as we whizzed past W. Flamingo Road and suggested, \""Make a right turn!\"" to my bf.  As we drove up, we noted the \""Closed\"" sign and knew a return visit was a must.  \n\nComing up with some cute names as \""Road to Hana\"" and \""Strawberry Fields Way\"", Cupcake Lane Bakery tantalizes your taste buds with their large selection of tasty morsels.  After reading through each and every description, my friend chose the \""Michigan Avenue\"", the bf chose the \""Lake Tahoe Boulevard\"" in honor of his hometown, and I went for the \""Hollywood Boulevard.\""  (I technically should have gone for the \""Lombard Street\"" or the \""Ghiradelli Square\"" in tribute to my hometown!)\n\nThe \""Michigan Avenue\"" is a \""lemon-infused cupcake topped with a zesty lemon cream cheese frosting and garnished with yellow and blue sprinkles.\""  My friend was impressed and knew she was in big trouble since this location was not too far from where she lived.  Not being a huge lemon fan myself, I was hesitant.  It was rather refreshing and light.  Sweet without being tart, and actually, pretty darn good.\n\nThe \""Lake Tahoe Boulevard\"" is described as \""Sitting around the campfire and enjoying our take on the S'more.  A chocolate cupcake with a marshmallow center, topped with chocolate ganache and crushed graham crackers and finished with a drizzle of chocolate.\""  It tasted like a brownie with a gooey center.  It was yummy, but not that special in my opinion.\n\nSticking with the basics, the \""Hollywood Boulevard\"" is \""a vanilla cupcake topped with vanilla buttercream and sprinkled with stars.\""  I felt this was the best way to truly taste the cupcake and the cream on its own.  The cupcake was moist, flavorful, and could stand alone.  The buttercream was sweet, not overly done, and not dependent on the cupcake to stand. I was impressed.  \n\nCupcake Lane Bakery has a lot of promise.  The interior decor could use some help and they have two solo couches and two small chairs for sitting.  They also offer monthly special cupcakes, like this month's was the \""Times Square\"" which had champagne in it.  At $2.25/each, or $23/dozen, they are definitely going to be fair competition.  I'll be back to try the \""Savannah Street\"" and the \""Park Avenue.\""\n\nSidenote: They even offer a Pupcake, a cupcake made specifically for your furry four-legged friend!"
1,"Food is OK - sometimes good - used to be great.  The service is terrible and a 25 minute wait for lunch on Saturday at 1:00?  Seriously?  It seems the restaurant relies on takeout - hostess ignored folks waiting to get on the wait list (irony intended) to serve carryout customers - could the tips have an influence?\nWe were finally seated - had Shrimp Pad Thai and Red Chicken Curry - the curry was very good, but shrimp was overcooked and the dish tasted substantially different from last visit.  The restaurant is incredibly loud, to the point of distracting.  \nWe used to go here often, but will be eating at other places from now on when Saturday shopping."
0,"After entering I signed in and then waited ten minutes, and still no one acknowledged me.  So I went to front desk and said I was new to this service, she told me to fill out paperwork.  All the ladies behind the front desk were very busy chatting.  Where is customer service these days!"
0,"I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast \""elites\"" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:) \n\nWhy they let me play, I'll never know:)\n\nLast evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)\n\nIt was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a \""Rodgering\"":)\n\nSo it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)\n\nWhere to start...I know...the parking lot:)\n\nWhen we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)\n\nAfter I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than \""regal\"" atmosphere:)\n\nThey must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)\n\nThe smell in S&J can only be described as \""extreme humanity\""...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)\n\nS&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on \""tap\"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or \""boofay\"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.\n\nIt was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)\n\nS&J provided a table full of taco \""fixin's\""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(\n\nThey told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground \""creature\""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.\n\nI kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, \""beef\""...just not very good \""beef\"":(\n\nThe hot tray holding the \""meat\"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of \""meat\"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(\n\nBut, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.\n\nI decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(\n\nI got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(\n\nOne of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not \""broiled\""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)\n\nThen they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(\n\nAdding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)\n\nStill, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).\n\nThey say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)"
3,"The beers they have on tap span a large spectrum. It is also cool how they have a TV specifically to show the lifespan of each keg. The only time my group goes to A&A is for their Tuesday night Geeks Who Drink Pub Quiz. \n\nEach time we come, there is a beer I haven't had before and that makes for a fun experience. Especially since I am not much help with in the random knowledge department. I'll still make my presence known with a few drinks though. \n\nThe food is typical greasy bar food. The nachos are lackluster. The Juicy Lucy and the Rueben are rather delicious though. Most of the items that come out of the fryer has a pool of oil on the bottom of the plate. For some this is a good sign that a hangover will not be coming. \n\nThe service staff has always been nothing but friendly. They check up rather often and give a great pep talk."
1,"I used to be a member, and I think it's seen it's better days. It's not very exclusive when they hand out passes to everyone who walks into the casino. Now, it just seems old and a bit beat up. It used to be the place I wanted to go. Now, it's just the place I go if (insert club here) is too crowded. As for the food, it's Vegas. You can do better (and pay less). It still is probably the best view in Vegas, and if you can afford the New Years Eve party, it's unforgettable. It was great when you could watch the HOB shows live in the media room.\n\nGo for drinks on the patio, but not for any other reason."
0,"This place I went to is at 4840 S Eastern.\n\nI bought a lamp there.  I bought it because I liked the lamp shade.  I got home, the lampshade didn't fit my my lamp.  I thought \""ehh maybe they'll let me take it back and switch it for a couple of towels or something I'll use.\""\nI called.  I talked to a slightly snotty woman who was very happy to tell me there are no exchanges or refunds, and in all fairness it does say that on the receipt, so I was like, \""oh ok it does say that.\""\nSo I go to the lamp and I'm thinking well, I'll use in in the living room.\nThe knob was gone.  No way to turn it on without pliars.\nI call back, I tell her there's no knob.  This time she was VERY snotty to me.  She said I could talk to her manager, but they \""have people checking these things before they put them on the floor, so I know it was there.\""  I asked her if she was accusing me of lying about the knob on a $7.50 lamp?  She was so snotty I decide her manager needs to know.  Lol, only when I get there I find he is even worse than her!\n\nI drive all the way back there, because I am that upset.  I meet the manager.  I felt like I was dealing with a mentally undeveloped 7 year old.  I'm rarely rude but I am direct and outspoken about how I'm being treated, especially if I've given a place my business and spent money there.  \n\n- He told me it was my responsibility to check to see if anything is broken before I buy it.\n- I told him it's his employees' job to do that before things are put on the floor.  \n\n- He then told me he \""knew\"" it had a knob when I bought it, because someone had \""told\"" him they saw it with the knob.  \n- I asked him \""Did you just accuse me of lying to you about the knob?\""  (Seems to be a theme going on here.)\n\nHe points to a young man working there who looks at me and blurts out, \""I saw it 2 weeks ago, it could have fallen off.\""  \n\n- Then the manager asks me in a snotty tone, \""Why don't you go find a knob somewhere and put it on it?\""\n- I look at him and ask him, \""Why don't YOU go find a knob somewhere and put it on it?\""     \n\nWhich he then did. A knob that was too small and doesn't fit on the metal part that sticks out, and fell off in my car on the way home.  I asked him if he took it off another lamp and he proudly stated \""YES I DID.\""  I tried to put it on when I got home but its too skinny and it's supposed to screw on and the threading doesn't match up.  The whole thing is worthless.  He's not THAT inept; he could tell it didn't fit.  He just jammed it on there well enough so it wouldn't fall off while he was walking with it.  He so blatantly derived pleasure in sending me out the door feeling ripped off and angry that I became even more angry I spent money there.\n\nI didn't get his name.  But he appears to be one of those old school party types that lost most their teeth from whatever recreational chemical activities they used to partake in. ? (100% my impression.)  He was sure pleased with himself to send me out the door angry with that useless lamp.  \n\nReally?  Accused by two people of lying about the missing knob on a $7.50 lamp and sent out the door purposely agitated by Mr I-need-to-feel-some-power-in-this-life-manager-guy.  That was enough for me.  Over a $7.50 lamp.  Geeeez.  I'll pay the $30 at Bed Bath and Beyond from now on.  Who knew?  I always thought Catholic Charities was a good place to shop because you're helping a good cause.  Treated like that??  No thanks.\n\n(*Let me add I also called the store on Rainbow to vent when I got home, and spoke to a very nice woman, named Nicole.  This is not who I am referring to above when I said I called and they were snotty.)"
0,"Well, this is truly a yawner.  The show does have some great acrobats, but the story is hard to follow.  The moving stage gets old quickly.  Totally not worth the high ticket price.  I was disappointed."
1,"As far as a company, Famous Footwear treats me really well.  But this review is specifically for this location. \n\nThe selection available at this store is just terrible.  This might as well be an outlet store. \n\nAfter stopping in several times over the past 10 years, I've never even seen a shoe, sandal or boot I actually wanted to even try on.  \n\nI order most of my shoes online through Famous, but the location at Tempe Marketplace usually has a decent selection.  Head and shoulders above the selection here."
1,"Alert: every dish that involves sauce is bubbling tar pit of sodium and sugar. You'll need to reserve three hours to nap afterwards, and maybe another hour for rolling around, glassy eyed and confused about where you are.\n\nThe crispy tofu pad thai, tangerine shrimp, and soft shell crab curry are definitely tasty... but I'd rather down a triple scoop sundae if I'm going to go into a food coma afterwards, regardless."
0,"If I were playing the word association game, after going here, my first word would be: MEH.\n\nThis place is so overrated and like the other reviews say, just completely disorganized when it comes to going in. So my friends and I got all dolled up thinking that we would get some promoter's attention which basically worked everywhere but here. We were like, alright, cute asian girls.. alas NO. One of my friends actually spotted someone who looked like a promoter (and turned out to be one) who put us on the list probably cuz we asked. \n\nAfter getting there, we realized why we probably were not approached - this is completely not our scene. Unfortunately we're not so into euro-techno music and people were not at dressed up as we thought they would be. \n\nWhen we got there this big promoter guy told us to just hang out near one of the velvet ropes because we were on the list. He wasn't really clear and put us in a line with a group of guys. After a while he saw that we were standing in the wrong place and then finally let us in. \n\nWe got in the club and man.. it was kind of boring from the get go. We decided we would get our drinks, down it and hop over to Tao. Too bad we weren't more drunk at that time because maybe we would have stayed, but our intense sobriety warned as against that. As we tried to leave, some guy told us to go another way. Well, liar, it wasn't another way... it was another room where a crowd of people were just standing there watching half naked girls dance. I'm not sure what impression we gave that guy, but I could have sworn we had the desperate-to-get-out-here look, not the we-want-to-look-at-other-girls-dance look. \n\nAt least in the end we made it out and over to Tao where we definitely had a much more exciting night (aka VIP, patron, belvedere, fun)"
3,"My kids enjoy watching some small aircrafts take off and landing from this cafe. The food is good and service is excellent. It's overcrowded in the weekends it takes 30 minutes to get a seat. But couldn't complain as we get to see some airplanes up close meantime. Restaurant couldn't take reservations and the ambience for family caf\u00e9 is absent. There is lot of scope for improvement, I am not sure if they already have plans for it."
3,"I have had their Brisket on several occasions, pretty good stuff, I am a BBQ fanatic, if I like it, you may love it, I have tried BBQ from some of the best cooks in the world... that being said, this stuff is pretty damn good... try it for yourself"
2,"This place is your typical chinese buffet. They have the typical entrees: general tso's chicken, sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, chow mein noodles, fried rice, crab rangoon, egg rolls, egg drop soup, blah blah. On the plus side, every trip I took to the buffet they always had a pile of hot snow crab legs, steamed clams, and shrimp cocktail. At most chinese buffets you are waiting for them to refill these seafood items, but here they are always full. If your in the mood for seafood, and not chinese, you can come here and be satisfied."
3,"My favorite casual comfort spot whenever hubby and I are in town. Prices are a little steep for Asian food, but the food is always good, so it's a fine trade off.\n\nYou must order their Hainanese Chicken Rice. It's the best I've ever had!! I was beyond stuffed, but kept stuffing my face because it was so damn good. My hubby's favorite is the Mandarin Beef Noodle. The flavors are on point and is super delicious. Their Wing Zing chicken wings are so yummy. Their congee is great too. I wouldn't recommend their fried calamari though, it's a sorry miss.\n\nOnly 4 stars because services can be a bit slow and inattentive and isn't always consistent. It's unfortunate, but won't stop me from coming here. Their Hainanese Chicken Rice omg....."
2,"Great ambiance, very chic and modern. Plum has a very cute small bar in the front that is great while waiting for your table. Also, coming from Boston it's nice to know Pittsburgh is FINALLY getting some sushi places that are good!\n\nMy friends and I ordered some wine and sushi, the wine came quickly and we waited almost an hour after that for our food. We were chatting away but also growling for some food! It was very odd. The waitress seemed slow and disinterested. The host was a very fast, polite man but this waitress was weird. She told me they made my sushi wrong and then I just waited longer than my friends. \n\nEither way, the sushi was great! I got a Spicy Salmon Roll (which was about 6 pieces and delicious!) And a Skinny Roll that was SO good! Marinated veggies with slivered avocado on top! So delicious! \n\nI would definitely go back, interesting menu with asian fusion of thai too. Nice atmosphere. Good date place. Just hopefully get a different server than we did! Also, very convienent parking right upstairs in Borders! Very nice. \n\nWhen I'm in town next I'll come back and try more!"
2,"If it was all about  location, I'd give this Teeter 5 stars.  There isn't a supermarket even close to this location!  That being said, I find their items to be overpriced and it is much, much smaller than any other Harris Teeter I've been to.  If you want to grab a sub during lunch hours - good luck!  All the uptown businesses in the vicinity are out on lunch at roughly the same hour and the last time I visited at 12:30, there were literally 14 people on line with 2 sandwich makers. \n\nThey are currently renovating.  I do appreciate that there is a lot more room when you walk in.  I hated that everything was so close together in the produce isle!  I am also grateful that there is a parking lot that is totally free!   \n\nThis Teeter serves its purpose, but I'd rather drive a bit further to a supermarket with better prices and a bigger selection.  In a crunch, I couldn't live without it!"
2,"Crazy lines, but good thing we have VIP passes to skip the madness.\n\nEvery floor was crowded to dance and there were absolutely no seats to sit! How can a girl in heels survive?\n\nGreat music though."
4,"We had a wonderful meal at Crudo last week, which was a set menu with cocktail pairings. The decor and the staff were pitch perfect, once we found the place tucked in the back of the shopping center. Ours was a set menu for a special event, which it seems to me they must to on the regular as they had it down pat. \n\nThe first course was an albacore crudo with green apples and black garlic, which was paired with a vodka cocktail with celery juice and lime. I loved the crisp drink against the buttery albacore, and black garlic is a new one for me! \n\nThe second course was my favorite, both food and drink.  Burratta with marinated tomatoes, pimentos and garlic, served inside a mason jar, with grilled french bread on the side. This was served with a cognac cocktail with cardamom, grapefruit and lemon. I love burratta, and there aren't many places in Oklahoma who serve it, so I only get to have it when I'm traveling. \n\nThe third course was beef brisket with pork sugo in a creamy polenta, paired with Buffalo Trace bourbon with Cointreau and orange bitters. I loved the cocktail, and I enjoyed the dish. My only concern with the dish was my brisket seemed to have even more fat than brisket normally has. But there was so much food, and the dish was so rich, I wasn't unhappy at all to simply side those pieces over to the side and not eat them. If that had been my main entree, I might have taken exception to it. \n\nI'd love to come back here and check out the full menu and see it full of beautiful people on a busy Friday or Saturday night."
2,"I LOVE the food here, you can make your own stuff, combination, veggies and stuff.  delicious! the FOOD is great,\n\nThe service however, could be better, faster and more attentive.\n\nRonney"
0,"Buddhist bowl.  Awful, the use canned bamboo shoots and other canned ingredients.  Asked for extra spicy, instead of cooking with peppers, they give a container of hot sauce.  Manchu wok was 10x better"
1,"Drinking on Lothian Road is usually divided into 2 distinct sets of clientele - the stag party groups that frequent the seemingly endless stream of \""gentleman's clubs\"" along here, or the real ale drinkers who bar hop from Bennet's to The Cloisters and then work their way up towards Princes Street. And whilst, just for the record, I fall into neither of those categories, my flatmate loves a good real ale pub and so I've been dragged along here on a handful of occasions.\n\nIt's an ok pub, albeit a bit on the small and pokey side, and the construction works going on outside seem as if they're never going to end - this really doesn't add much to the atmosphere of the place. I think before the smoking ban came in this place would have been much more buzzing and vibrant, but now it just seems a bit redundant and boring. If you're going to a show or a gig at the adjacent Usher Hall, it's an ok place to pop in for a drink beforehand. Otherwise, you probably woldn't go out of your way to come here."
1,"It take a while to get your food but thats fine, simply because they make it to order.  \nThe sweet tea was bleh.\nThe fried chicken was good\nBBQ chicken was whatever\nCornbread pancake was very tasty and different.\nBanana pudding was good and red beans and rice and mac n cheese was pretty good.\nI had a vey friendly server.  The prices for soul food was a little much.  \nMaybe I'm harder cuz I grew up on soul food so didn't tickle my fancy and only 2 pieces of chicken in my lunch meal."
0,AVOID THIS LOCATION!!!! And I'm not the first person to say this. Today was the third time I have received terrible service at this location. Usually they take a good 10 minutes to make my drink. Today it was only 2 min but the lady that took my order was rude and blunt. She never greeted me nor did she thank me. I thanked her for taking my order and she didn't even reply. And to top it all off my drink was only filled 2/3 of the way. Time to start going to a different location.
3,"I used to work here. I won't get into the hairy details of being employed here (what the hell was I thinking) or let it sway my review, even if it was just for one month, but the gelato itself was great. This is my only gelato experience. There may be better out there, hell there probably is, but this was damn good for my only experience.\n\nOne word: Baccio. It's all you need.\nTry combining some of the flavors, too. The staff know which combine well, and which combine to make awesome (or interesting) flavors. Strawberry and banana? Check. Coconut and chocolate? Check. Peanut butter and Berry (to make PB&J?) ... okay, sure. check.\n\nFour stars strictly based on the gelato. And the windows on the gelato display, because I sure as hell spent many backbreaking moments windexing the damn things every ten minutes for the public's viewing pleasure."
3,Try the colbyjack burger. Greasy Yummy. Fries is ok.
2,"When I was in line for 20 minutes for this place I noticed Yelpers had a lot of bad things to say.  Well it was not that back.  Just a typical buffet.  Some of the food was cold and some not that good.  But they have some items that was really good and the crab legs and shrimp is a good addition.  The drinks too a very long time to get to us.  We waited for about 5 minutes for a waiter to come over to get our drink order before we even went to get our food.  The drinks came when I was almost done with my first plate.  I hate not having something to drink while I eat.  But the facility is updated and looks nice.  Overall, it was what we expected."
2,I'm from Venezuela and I can said that the food is good but the owner need to work in how him give attention to the client he is not so kind and that can make your business go down
4,"Great price (duh) and they are super fast. I've never waited longer than 5 minutes to get in and grab some food. Nice folks behind the counter, too."
4,"Just stopped by today at this place they greeted us nicely to our table, The environment was nice with live persian music it took about 15 minutes to get our order it was delicious. \nHighly recommended and worth stoping by."
3,Went on a monday around 6 waited an hour not bad Food was extreamly good looked just like their video...only thing was twoards the end of dinner around 830 9 the food quality started to go down so next time im getting there earlier so i can get in at five the $15 per person line pass if you have the money and dont want to wait is awesome! cant wait to go again and make this a five star review!
1,"I went to Gilleys last night. I have been wanting to go since they opened. I had the pulled pork dinner and it was horrible. The drinks they have are good. I had a razberry lemonade and it was so good, I wish they had it in a pitcher. The server sucked and needs training on customer service. I will not go back for the food, maybe a beer or water with lemon if I'm thirsty at TI."
1,"CAPRIOTTI'S!!! Y U NO get my order right??\n\nI came to this location for the first time today and ordered four sandwiches. Two of the four came out right.\n\nMy sister is boring and she likes her sandwiches with almost nothing on them. I am the opposite. I like my sandwiches Primanti's-style--filled to the brim and only edible if you kind of tilt your head sideways and gnaw at them. So, you can imagine my sadness when I got home and my sandwich turned out to be the vegetarian version of my sister's (turkey, cheese, lettuce.) It was a mere ghost of what a sandwich should be. I even asked for pickles and of course, there were no pickles. :(\n\nThe other issue is that I asked for wheat on my sister's sandwich. Maybe there was a communication problem, since the person who took my order handed it off to someone else.\n\nOn the plus side, my sandwich was good (at least the \""meat\"" was correct!) and the employees could not have been nicer. Capriotti's sandwiches are so good that I'll keep coming back despite service issues (until I find a replacement.)"
2,"they really do make you eat with your hands!!! the food was decent. the soup was good, but it got cold really fast. The game hen was good just a bit dry. the desert was blah..... the show is funny, but really really corny. Great for kids tho!"
0,"I was excited to bring my family here. We came in to bowl an hour of fun. What happened was our waitress kept refilling our pitcher while a quarter was still there, and tried to pour it out in our glasses every chance she could. In the end she charged for every refill.. Of soda. $10 each time. I gladly tipped the hostess. Waitress said it was a weird new rule (umm, to rip off patrons?) she said it was mgts fault, so I asked for mgt. of course Ashley was in a meeting. Terrible first and last impression. Beware, for a good time skip the scam."

3,"I wish we would have spent more time on fremont street when we came to Vegas.  I felt a lot more comfortable here then on the strip.  Its an interesting mix of street performers, historical sites, and new technology.  Its a little seedy, but the strip has a little seedy too.  We took public transportation there and while cheaper, it took forever.  We took a cab back and it was a much more enjoyable experience.  \n\nI liked the vibe of the restaurants and bars here.  Everything is more affordable.  Things are less opulent and less clean, but a lot more comfortable.  I like the throw back vibe to everything, it felt like stepping back in time.  Nobody here takes themselves too seriously as it is Vegas after all.  I really liked the restaurants and bar here, there are some very nice restaurants, but again cheaper then the strip and with a more historical ambiance.  The video screen is very cool too!"
2,"I won some party tixs to Studio 54 and my friends and I decided to grab a quick bite here before heading there. I truly have mixed emotions about this place.\n\nFirst off,  I ordered a pizza and the pizza was HUGE and it was sooo delicious! I could only eat half and was sad to not be able to bring home the other half since we didn't have a fridge in our hotel room. What a waste! I hate wasting food! I should have totally shared. The prices of the pizza was around $15 but it's pretty darn big and yummy. WAY better than CPK which is roughly around the same price and yet a tad smaller.\n\nBut the worst thing about this place is its service! We waited a long long time until they finally took our order and waited over 40 minutes until our food was finally cooked. It was an insane amount of time. This was on a Tuesday night! It wasn't even a weekend but I guess they were still busy. But I still personally feel waiting nearly an hour is just absurd and retarded. They did take one of our meals off because we complained but it was just the $8 soup taken out. They should have given us 50% off the whole bill since we waited so very long.\n\nSo next time you come here. Share the pizza and enjoy it! It's delicious and I might come back just for that but as long as you know the service can possibly suck, just either accept it or don't come here at all."
3,"From a food perspective....  the meats were awesome.  Prime rib?  boo yah dawgie dawg.\n\nAsian food was pretty good for buffet style.   The sushi rice was packed in although I think their mixture for making sticky rice was a little tooooo sticky since the rolls would clump together.  Sushi in general fine although not as good in choice as sushi buffets but made up in the plating and a few choice things that you usually can't get in buffets like temaki rolls.\n\nThey actually made a go at soup dumplings which I was definitely interested in.  It's by no means Din Tai Fung, but they were pretty yummy considering.  I think they packed them in little tin foil platters just so they could hold the warmth that's needed and have a little of the soup in them.\n\nDidn't have the crab legs, but I will say that pre-cut crab legs are a good idea in theory, but less great in reality.   It's still hard to crack without a nutcracker.\n\nYou can actually make things to order which is definitely a HUGE plus for this place.\n\nAlso, a huge miss for most buffet goers was the special salads (watermelon and feta cheese) and the prosciutto.   I think that in general it scares the general populace because it's different from what you expect in a buffet.\n\nDamned good coffee.  That's all you can really say about that.\n\nDesserts looked awesome.  I can't really say how they tasted since I'm not a big fan of desserts in general.\n\nService was excellent and the logistics of opening a place like that has got to be a nightmare.   So I was happy to see that drinks were taken care of and waiters were always on top of their game.   Curious to see if 6 months to a year from now, if that would still be the case.\n\nOverall, it's a great buffet to check out.  Not sure if it's the best in the world, but for sure it's unique enough to contend."
3,"Was just here a few weeks ago on a work trip. Hotel was lovely, staff was very friendly, room service always arrived on time, and the hotel was extremely clean! The bed was super comfortable, nothing compared to my own bed of course, but the second best thing! I will definitely be staying here again on another Vegas trip."
0,"If you really are just looking for a cheap place to stay in Vegas, then I guess this place is fine though you are better off at Luxor since at least you are on the Strip.  If you have any other expectations, this place is a complete dump and you should spend the extra money to go somewhere decent. I can't find much, if anything, to like about this hotel other than that it was free for me as the company foot the bill.  The wireless is PAINFULLY slow (like dial-up slow), the gym costs $20/day and is akin to a cheap 1980s Jane Fonda era place with mainly broken down machines, the towels are like dishrags, the food is horrendous in both the Buffet and the restaurants I tried, the bottled water is $4, etc.  Hell, the wakeup call service is completely ridiculous and the HD TV does not have any HD channels with it. Clearly, Hilton has given up on this place and no investment is being made to do any upgrades to anything. \n\nMainly, it is full of drunk, chain smoking rednecks stumbling around the hotel and it is on the FAR end of the Strip so don't expect to walk anywhere.  Go to the Wynn or the Bellagio if you can foot the bill or try the Paris or MGM as they usually have some decent room rates."
1,"Typical Indian fare with nothing especially good or bad.  Friendly but slow service. Portions are small, but prices are reasonable.  Bring your own wine or beer - but there is no Kingfisher to be found in the depanneur across the street.  Unfortunately, at 7:00 p.m., they dim the lights and turn up the Indian techno music, spoiling any chance for table-wide conversation."
4,Suggestions :\n\nBook an Appointment. \nHave a lowered car?  \nDefinetely book an appointment in advance. \n\nAndre was honest when I got in. He said he would try to squeeze me into their time slot. Dealership quality service at a small shop location. Will probably do my major work at this location.
4,"Although both JPP's in Vegas are huge, Aria edges out the one at Bellagio for selection and service.  There were also at least twice the amount of employees at this location so the line moved a lot faster.  I was able to buy some truffles and other chocolate treats to bring back home!  Quick tip: be sure to refrigerate your chocolate ASAP otherwise it'll melt in the Vegas sun!  We were lucky to have an extra mini fridge in our room so it wasn't a problem but our cousins who came along were devastated when theirs melted before they had a chance to bring them back to their hotel.  I am also noticing the reviews for the food at JPP so I'll have to add that to my list of must-eats next time I'm in Vegas."
0,"\""Ok..... bare-able.... but not good\""\n\nBeen here many times... Keep trying to believe Big Bens will come thru.... Oh well\n\nFood is still par... Absolutely nothing to write home about.\n\nAnd the bar...How frustrating ..... Still charging way too much.\n\nWe truly tried, tried and tried again....   Good bye, Big Bens."
2,"This place is ok, the menu has a good selection of foods and the staff seemed friendly enough.  It was crowded so it took a little while to get our table and our food, however the decor of the place keeps your mind off of the wait time.  \n\nThe food is average, I cannot say it was horrible, but it was not memorable enough to say that it was fantastic.  There are many other choices of places to eat, however, if I find myself in an area with an Elephant Bar, I know what to expect going in.\n\nI know the staff vary from place to place, I have been here once before and sat in the bar with a friend and I can say the bartendar, a young girl was not the most pleasant.  She was nice and took care of us, but her sense of humor was not a warm and welcoming persoanlity, it is like she was there because it was a job and nothing more.  \n\nIf you are hungry this is not a bad place and know you will get ok food here, but do not expect a gourmet meal.  Friendly service is a toss up by place and person you deal with I guess, but like I said I would go here again if needed."
4,"I cannot even begin to express how much I enjoyed Rose. Rabbit. Lie.!  I've been to Vegas many times, but this is so far, the best experience I've had in Vegas. Spent five days in Vegas a couple weeks back and decided to have a fancy date night on our first night in the city. I had heard from a friend that this place was supposedly \""really good\"". Thought this would be a great place to kick off our Vegas vacation. \n\nHad reservations at 9pm, but when we got there, our table wasn't ready. We were escorted to a lounge that resembled a mini library while we waited for our table, which we didn't really mind because we had wanted to get pre-dinner drinks anyways. As the door for the lounge opened, another door leading to the main dining room opened up and it felt like a different world hidden behind the door. Definitely got me excited for our dinner. \n\nThe lounge was quiet compared to the door we had just walked by. It definitely had a Great Gatsby feel. We tried Airmail and El Diablo, both delicious, but I enjoyed Airmail more. Once we finished our drinks, we were escorted into the main dining room. Decor was great and I loved the lighting in the restaurant. As soon as we sat down, a band started to play. I was sitting back to back with the band with a partition between us. As the music started to play, I said how awesome that there was a band in the other room, and then as I said that the partition started to go down and I was watching the band from behind. It was really cool that the partition goes down, because then even in our part of the restaurant, we could watch the entertainment as well. The band was great, so was the kid that was tap dancing on the piano. \n\nNow let's get to the good part -- the food!\n\nRose. Rabbit. Lie was a great place for us because we are small plates type of eaters. We love food so when given the opportunity to try a number of dishes, we are happy. \n\nStarted off with the gougeres, which is like a soft biscuit filled with truffle mornay sauce. That was good, but not the greatest thing. We also got the oysters on the half shell. Four oysters with a trio of sauces -- cognac cocktail sauce, mignonette, and horseradish sorbet. Used all three and the combination was amazing. Oysters were really fresh too! We also got the Heavenly Eggs, which I had seen on the menu, but didn't seem too exciting. However, our amazing server convinced us to try these and I am SO glad he did! Rather pricey at $6 each for a small piece of egg custard with black truffle. But OMG! So delicious! If you come to Rose. Rabbit. Lie, you HAVE to order this. Something different for sure but you won't regret it. We almost got another order. \n\nAfter that, we moved on to the brussel sprouts, which has crispy chicken skin, manchego, and paprika. They were good, but I think next time I will order a new dish to try in its place. Got the bone marrow, which was really good as well! Also ordered the duck confit pasta, and I would definitely order this again. Sometimes pasta with a cream sauce can leave me feeling heavy and full, but not this. A smaller serving of pasta than usual, but then again we were sharing everything. I might have to get my own order next time :P We ended our meal with small chocolate truffles served on ice for dessert and those were good too, really smooth and not too sweet.\n\nIf you're looking for something different to do in Vegas, I highly recommend going to Rose. Rabbit. Lie. I wouldn't recommend it for a first date since it does get loud in there, making it hard to talk. But the ambiance and live entertainment is great, food and its presentation is amazing, service is wonderful, and it's just such a fun experience! I will definitely be going back."
3,"Regardless that I write a lot of Starbuck's reviews,  I yelp it loud and proud that I am a Dunkin Donuts fan. Dunkin Donut's coffee, doughnuts, and bagels are a part of my New York heritage. If you gave me a taste test between Dunkin Donuts and Starbuck's coffee, I'd most likely choose Dunkin Donuts. Lol, it would be no comparison between a Dunkin Donut and  Starbuck's pastry. If Dunkin Donuts was outside the Las Vegas market, I'd ask a friend visiting New York to bring me back a dozen of Dunkin's donuts. Fortunately,  Dunkin Donuts has a niche in the competitive Las Vegas market.\n\n   Yesterday (6-28-2014), my brother and I stopped here after hours under the simmering July sun in Floyd Lamb Park. We were tired and thirsty. So, we drove down Durango Drive south toward the 215 and before Deer Springs Drive by Centennial Hills Hospital, we stopped off at the relatively new Dunkin Donuts. Parking problems were nonexistent. There is plenty of parking for Dunkin Donuts and the adjacent Molly's Casino. Furthermore, there is plenty of seating. We would sit at the two comfortable plush chairs with a view across Durango Drive of Centennial Hills Hospital.\n\n   The 103-plus July heat was not ideal weather for hot coffee. Oh he'll no! It was ideal weather for a Dunkin Donuts refreshing beverage that is over and above the Frapuccino. We came here for the Coolata. The Coolata is Dunkin Donuts version of the Frapuccino. In my opinion it is better. Why? Dunkin Donuts has partnered with Baskin Robbins at many locations. For example on Long Island,  New York; the majority of Dunkin Donuts share the same roof with Baskin Robbins. This partnership has given Dunkin Donuts knowledge of ice cream. It is a partnership that resulted in the Coolata. Even the menu states that the Coolata is Baskin Robbins inspired. When I sipped the Iced Mocha Coolata I was so convinced. This beverage that brought me from sleepiness to awakeness in a few minutes, tasted just like a shake. Next time I'm getting the Oreo Coolata. It is a cool way to wake up. What is really cool is that a large Coolata only came out to $3.99. If you add a doughnut, it will come out to the price of a Frapuccino. \n\n  Sometimes I don't appreciate things until its too late. I don't want to make the same mistake with Dunkin Donuts. As long as they are in Vegas and they support their customers, I will support Dunkin Donuts. My support starts with shouting out loud that I am a Dunkin Donuts fan that gives this location four stars."
3,"Only in Las Vegas...but can't imagine a better place for it.  \n\nI really thought the lights would make the place seem silly, but they are done well and really ads to the venue.  If you haven't been, make sure you wear something that will glow in the lights and bring a camera.  My phone didn't work well with the lighting, but then again...it's just a phone!\n\nThe only thing that kept me from giving it a full 5 stars was a few of the \""props\"" were broken and when asked when they will be fixed, the staff didn't know and responded \""it's been broken for a while now\"".  The majority of the props worked perfectly, so we will be back to play again soon.\n\nI wouldn't say it is a family venue, but our teenagers had a good time and want to go back.  The gift shop has some unique items and the overall place was very well done."
1,"What is it about Sonic that screams \""our customer service sucks\""? It doesn't matter which one we go to or what we order there is always some punk kid walking out giving us attitude because they got the order wrong or didn't hear us mention the coupon we have. Tonight was no different. We walked up to the menu board to order and the first thing my wife mentioned was that she had a coupon for $2 off her purchase. The guy talking the order said \""ok\"" and asked what she wanted... easy enough right? Nope, not for Sonic as the guy came out with her shake and asked for payment... when he saw the coupon he stormed back in (With the shake) and when he came back his first words were, \""Next time you need to tell us you have a coupon when you place the order\"". Hmmmm, I thought we did that... The place gets 2 stars because my wife loves their milk shakes."
4,This place is great! Always friendly service and they have good facebook deals too!
2,"This review is only for the location on Frank Llyod Wright.  This location is the main one, which the owner frequents most often.  It is open and very light.  Everyone sits at a table, there are no booth and no bar.  The food here is a bit better then the location on Tatum.  The pizza is a great price.  Large cheese pie is less than $13.00...the sauce is  a tad salty but if you ask them to put extra basil on the cheese it lessens the taste of the salt.  The pasta here is better than the other location and the wait staff it good.  There are many other places to eat Italian food in the area, but this place is good with the same crowd coming in day after day.  The meatball subs and seafood pasts dish are pretty tasty.  Great inexpensive place for linch."
2,"The flavor is still ridiculously good, the atmosphere is better with the high ceiling and well lit space, but the crawfish are not worth the money. The ones during this visit hardly had any meat. The real deal are the shrimp. These big, plump, and juicy crustaceans steal the show.\n\nAt Hot N Juicy, start by picking a protein, followed by seasoning, then the spice factor and finish it off with extras that they will cook in all the juices. For four, we easily dined on one pound of Hot N Juicy Special Spicy Crawfish with two pieces of corn and potatoes, two pounds of HNJ Special Extra Spicy Shrimp with two pieces of corn, two potatoes and half a dozen pieces of sausage, and a basket of ten fried shrimp ($10.99). Most of the seafood are sold at market price, but they tend to stay between $10-$12. Corn are .75, potatoes are .60, and the half portion of sausage was $2.75. The fried shrimp were not a favorite. The cornmeal batter is great for crispiness, but I could barely spot any shrimp. It end up feeling like I was eating friend bread. Beers are cheap for a restaurant. $2.75 for Bud, Bud Light, and Miller Light. $3 for Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon. For a quarter more, I am down with getting the import beers. \n\nThe service was decent tonight. Our server was quick to refill our water cups. Even one that wasn't ours refilled our cups. Our server did look disappointed that our order was so small, but it was more than enough for us. At a little over $60, the bill is not a cheap meal. I am still more fond of the original location, but this one is rather attractive."
1,"Ate here with a group of 6 people recently.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  The decor is lively and fun. Unfortunately things went downhill from there...maybe we had a bad cook that day but I sampled most dishes from our party and was severely dissapointed with most dishes, especially for the prices being charged.  I had the duck breast, and it was way undercooked even though I asked for medium-well.  When I questioned the waiter, he was condescending and said \""They don't like overcooking duck- that's the way it should be.\""  Ooookay, I guess being the customer and paying $40 for raw duck is my fault and I'm too stupid to know what I like.  The pork was ok, but again was undercooked.  The sweet potato tamale was good as was the salmon.  The blue corn muffins were extremely dry and crumbled into a million pieces before I could even take a bite.  Honestly I think this place is a tourist ripoff with a strange and poorly executed menu."
0,This is by far the worse KFC I have ever been to. No matter what I have ordered it takes for ever. The food taste old! We need corporate to come revamp the staff and retrain on the cooking or they won't stay be in business much longer.
4,"I have historically bought my bicycles at Budget Bikes in Madison. I still love Budget, but I cannot say enough good things about the team at Trek East. \n\nWe purchased a road bike for my wife in March, 2012 and they have been wonderful about tune-ups, minor repairs and recommendations ever since. \n\nThis past weekend my wife unfortunately took a tumble (well, actually, SOARED) over her handlbars while on a ride in Green County. Her drop bars and shifters were pretty banged up. We took the bike in to the Trek store and they immediately went to work re-setting her shifters and re-wrapping her handlebars, but only after what seemed like every person on staff asked if she was okay from the fall.\n\nTerrific, friendly service like this is priceless. \n\nThank you, Trek East!"
0,"I gave this place five stars originally, as our first visit was tremendous. The food, no matter what, is amazing. The service, however, depends entirely upon one person (Diane).\n\nWe have been five times. As I say, the first time was amazing... outstanding food, a very inviting atmosphere, and impeccable service from our waitress, Diane.\n\nThe last four times have convinced us never to enter the restaurant unless Diane is there. The \""gentleman\"" who seems to manage the place during the day time is so aloof and downright rude that you leave the restaurant upset that you gave anyone there any money.\n\nOn our last dining experience two groups--one on each side of us--both expressed the same sentiments. The staff during the day is horrible, and it affects the entire experience of dining.\n\nIt is a shame, Chef Marc, that you do not have better people representing your restaurant. Let me say this to you and to everyone considering dining here: if Diane is there, you will love this place. If she is not, you will despise it... despite the incredible efforts of the kitchen staff.\n\nI won't be going back for a considerable time, and never during the daytime."
1,"Cheesy, outdated decor, sky high prices with service that does not match, so so food. Went here on a recommendation and because they have home made gluten free pasta. Sorry we did. Our server was very proud of the fact that he knew we were gluten free and knew how to take care of us. I reminded him again when salads were ordered. Mine came with a breadlike object on top and when questioned, he said, it's a cracker stick, like that was okay. When I picked up the bowl and handed it back to him, he started to remove the crumbly stick, like that would now make my contaminated salad gluten free. Then, the crumbs fell into my daugher's Caprese salad, so both had to be reordered. My daughter's dish was not correct, nor was her pasta side, so they remade the pasta. Gluten free pasta cannot be al dente, but this was. I found a piece of non gluten free pasta mixed in with mine, leading me to suspect they make the gluten free with the regular pasta. Dirty dishes were not removed in a timely manner nor were water glasses filled. Just an odd, outdated place. Felt like I was back in Jersey, without the good food."
1,"You know, \n\nNobu is good. \n\nNobu is good in Malibu, but Vegas being the copycat of LA seems to dress down all of the cities great places and ruin their names.\n\nThe fish was \""eh\"" \""Ok\""..... not super fresh as the Malibu location and also served with the \""I'm pretending this is LA, attitude\"".\n\nGet it right Vegas, if your planning on copying an icon at least make sure you can back it up with flavor, freshness and quality."
2,"I came here for lunch and wasn't very impressed. Unless you're already on your way in or out of Vegas, I don't think it's worth the drive. There was just nothing that tasted particularly special. I did hear that dinner is better because you can take advantage of the alcohol and pretty much preparty while you have dinner."
1,Saggy beds piss me off
0,"I've been coming here for a few years now , over that time I've seen the prices go up and the clientele go down. This place has gotten to the point where I  can't even eat here.... $10 for a dozen wings???!! Another 1.00 to grill em??!! Jeez!! The wings are so small it's more like 7 or 8. Also they use paper menus!!! Gross and cheap!! It kills my appetite when i look down and see someone's week old food chunks and grease spots on my menu! The whole experience left me feeling like I need to wash my hands."
2,"The grilled selections, excellent. We tried the 34 oz delmonico steak was perfect, and the grilled seafood platter, yummy. Done to perfection. The highlight of the meal.\n\nSausage appetizer, good. Garlic shrimp, good.\n\nThe Paella and other dishes, meh. 2 stars at best. \n\nThe Paella was a disappointment. They used their regular rice and just added stuff to it. Definitely not the classical paella where the rice and food is cooked together.\n\nThe assorted seafood salsa verde, meh. The seafood was cooked correctly, but the salsa verde wasn't like any salsa verde that I had before. Bland. Not recommended. \nDefinitely not green.\n\nService was ok. It could have been more attentive. We had to keep asking for items, refills, bread, etc. This should have been handled automatically.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't consider this a Spanish restaurant, but a bar and grill. If you \nstick with the grilled selections, you won't be disappointed."
3,"I have been looking for a good ice cream and boba spot ever since Perfect Scoop started sucking big ones. Looks like the solution is here! All the things that make an ice cream shop great are present and accounted for.\n\n1. They make everything in-house.\n2. Service is nice!\n3. A huge variety of flavors, although not necessary. Still nice to see things like taro, black sesame, and Rocher.\n4. They have boba.\n5. They can spice up your ice cream with waffles - regular and red velvet!\n6. They even make their own waffle cones. Pretty easy but cool.\n7. Stamp cards.\n8. I'm not sure if this is a plus or not since I haven't tried them but they have egg rolls and other snacks in case you're hungry for something greasy.\n\nI got a triple scoop waffle bowl with stracciatella, \""Rocher\"" (yes the golden foil-wrapped chocolates), and Reese's PB cup flavor. The stracciatella was delicious, the Rocher really tasted just like a Rocher! Imagine my surprise. Reese's was a really nice peanut butter flavor with chocolate bits. I really liked all of them! It was all washed down with a Thai tea boba. Boba was good, though I prefer it firmer. It was a little bit away from mushy. Thai tea itself was fine.\n\nIf there was anything I didn't like it was the sweetness of the ice cream itself. It was a bit too much for me but I bet most people will be ok with it. Also, I think vegan flavors would be awesome (that aren't just sorbets) since so many people are lactose intolerant! Myself included. It's a tough product to make well, though.\n\nI'd be back! I'm thinking about getting the taro flavor right now..."
3,"Durants is a great place to go have a nice dinner. Very dark in the dining room... I have eaten here twice. Both times that i was here i had the 18 oz ribeye which i was very happy with. It comes with your choice of garlic mashed, rice, or baked... the mashed were good.  It also came with the choice of soup or salad before the entree. The first time i came here i tried the soup, it was a corn chowder, it was pretty good for a starter.  The second time i was here i got a ceaser salad, ehh.... We also had the strawberry shortcake.... very good... enough for about 4-6 people tho... \n$$$"
0,Went for lunch and we all ordered Carne asada burrito. Food was plain and overpriced for what you get.
0,"I'm absolutely APPALLED at this Taco Bell! I used to actually frequent it rather often, but went on a bit of a fast food hiatus. I had a craving for Taco Bell and thought, \""why not?\""\n\nOh, I found out \""why not\"" in short order! First- the wait at the drive through was kind of ridiculous. Not just sitting in the line of cars, but once I'd placed my order, I sat at the window for quite awhile waiting for the food to be ready. When you're hungry and in a hurry, that's not the best thing. It is called \""fast food\"" for a reason, right? Apparently not here.\n\nOk, food obtained. I get home, get settled, and go to open the mini chicken quesadilla. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? First of all, the cheese is so melted that I can barely unrwrap the aluminum foil. Once I do get it open...my stomach lurched. The pile of BURNED, gooey, mess that is in the foil is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that anyone thought it was a good idea to pass this off as food and serve it to anyone. I took (and posted) a picture, but it went straight into the garbage.\n\nThe chalupa was luckily in good shape, and the only reason this wouldn't get a ZERO star review. (other than the fact that we can't award zero stars here).  Obviously, I won't be returning."
3,"Pretty good boutique.  Back in the day, the used to carry guys' clothing - basically the local stuff like Spraygraphic.  They had an epic sale when they decided to get rid of all of their men's clothing and I was able to get some good shirts for cheap.\n\nI like the way it's laid out inside and everyone was nice."
4,"This is our go-to SouthSide bar. Wings are great, burgers are excellent. Service is incredible - Jim, Erin, Kelly, Josh... All amazing people! The 2nd floor has held a bunch of our football drafts and we've rented for parties too. We love the BBT!"
2,"So the name is like naming a place The Pizza or The Burger or The Taco. \n\nThat said, The Sushi wins big points for the taste, but not for the portions or the price.\n\nInside is nice and cozy, with a basketball-arena style four-screen TV in the middle.\n\nIf price and portions were no object, this would be a five-star sushi bar as the care and taste of the sushi and sashimi can't be beat. \n\nThe problem is the pricing is above many other sushi bars in the area. And the portions - especially when it comes to the teriyaki dishes - are more set for hamsters than people. \n\nThe staff was cordial and offered hot tea or water to this guest waiting for a to-go order. \n\nAll in all, a slight recommendation if price is no object and you're not THAT hungry."
0,"We have brought our jeep to be serviced here for the past 6 years. Last week we brought it in for a simple oil leak. They call back notifying us that the computer fried. When we went to pay our bill for the oil leak, they had tacked on about a thousand dollars for the computer they broke and tried to charge us. We were very upset and was unable to talk to a manager till they next day who claims that they would give us a discount rate but wouldn't pay for the computer that they broke!"
3,"+500 points for the inspired genius of Chandelier, a 3-4 story crystal-draped bar which forms the centerpiece of the main casino complex.  Unprecedented masterpiece of extravagant design in the same league as classic Las Vegas magnificence like the original Stardust neon sign (which, in one of its later forms was salvaged from the demolition, and still exists somewhere in the Neon Museum). You would think the vast sparkling draperies must be plastic, for weight and safety reasons. But touch them--they're solid glass.\n\n+300 points for GREEN FELT gaming tables - only Paris, Cosmo, and Caesar's have them as far as I know--everywhere else they're beige, brown, purple, maroon... ugh.\n\n-200 points for the pervasive, inescapable stench of cigarette and cigar smoke and the presence, at each crowded table, of at least one heavy smoker.  \n\n+100 points for soft, padded walls in the halls."
1,"A 5-star performance in a 2-star venue - that's what it was when I recently went to the Marquee.\n\nTo be fair - there was some good.  It's conveniently located and, as far as I know, I didn't contract any strange diseases while there.\n\nNow, the rest.\n\nFirst strike - our experience trying to park.  First led into the tiny parking lot then told it was full by staff who seemed like it was their first day on the job.  How to get out?  They weren't sure.  What?\n\nOkay, parked across the street - still plenty of time for the show.  Then - the clusterf*ck that was the line to get in, aided by the total lack of signs differentiating between those there to buy tix and those with tix.  No rhyme, no reason.  Strike two.\n\nInside now - to the bar for a refresher.  $7 for a warm, flat beer served by a guy that acted as if it were solely my fault he had to work that night.  Strike three.\n\nThe show, as mentioned, was solid.  There are no bad seats (standing spots) in the place, though the acoustics are sort of like playing a stereo in a large closet.\n\nIt would take a band I really, really want to see to bring me back."
3,If you get the 1/2 size Nacos it is the perfect amount. Not the best place drinks wise if you are not a beer person... then again it is a brewery. I am just unable to drink beer due to allergies. So some more drink specials would be appreciated.
1,"If you like quantity over quality, this is the place for you. The food is mediocre at best. I ordered the 2 eggs, hashbrowns with a side of pancakes. It was a lot of food for only $5, but the large portions with cheap prices is the only thing they have going for them. My bf got the chicken fried steak, which he could not finish becuase it was too fatty. We were really looking forward to the biscuits and gravy after reading the reviews. However, we were very disappointed, as they completely lacked any flavor. \n\nIf you are looking for good quality food, skip this place."
3,"When I called, they went above and beyond to make sure I got a true quote, including coming out and checking my unit for serial numbers to check on warranty.  They were honest with the price, and they were my third quote and though a bit higher they guaranteed their work with a a year warranty.  Cooled my house down in one day in the middle of summer and called me twice to make sure it was all working!  very good honest service!"
4,"Birthday celebrations should be done up big and Beso definitely fits that description. From their signature cocktails to the food, very little disappoints. It was a friends birthday and she wanted to come to Beso then followed by a night of dancing up at Eve. This is definitely her right with the world ending and all.\n\nWe got their at 9pm and half of our group was running late, so we sat at the bar for a few cocktails. The Raspberry Beso is a definite must get for anyone who loves this berry, because it is has two types of raspberry liquors and fresh berries muddled in. The Cosmic Ginger was also a fine choice. I am a big fan of this root and it does not disappoint. The BBO was a blood orange centered drink, but was overpowered by the alcohol. My favorite was the Pear and Elderberry Sangria. It was a light white wine base with mellow flavors. All of these handcrafted drinks cost $15.\n\nWhen the rest of the party did show up, we ordered everything family style. Not too long after settling, orders of the paella balls, Eva's guacamole, seared crab cakes, olives and shaved almonds came out. As my friends would say, the guac was legit. The pure avocado goodness was balanced with no flavor being too strong. When breaking the crab cakes you could see the defined chunks of meat instead of a mass of unidentifiable mystery substance. The paella bites were my favorite. They were crisp on on the outside and soft in the center. This is an ingenious way to give the guest that crispy bottom of the pan feeling in every bite.\n\nFor entrees we got the chili rubbed skirt steak, salmon, pan seared chicken, and seared ahi tuna. The sides consisted of mac and cheese, house mash potatoes, and asparagus. The star of the dinner was the steak. Although it was the cheapest cut on the whole menu, it was tender and bursting with flavor. Even if price was not a factor, I would have ordered it again. The sides were all very good, but the mac and cheese was the best. It was creamy and decadent. I only allowed myself a few bites because it is a slippery slop to heaping scoops.\n\nFor dessert, we got the churros, a banana creme brulee, and the chocolate cake. Fried dough and sugary is never a mistake right? Especially at Beso. They were light, soft and better than any churro I have ever had. They came with a caramel sauce and whipped cream for dipping. It is not a suggestion. The creme brulee was good, just not as noteworthy. The chocolate cake, on the other hand, struck a up a negative reaction. It was salty on it's own, but when paired with the ice cream it was a nice mix of sweet and salty like caramel, but you do not get too much of the frozen delight, so it went mainly uneaten.  \n\nThis is a great restaurant to impress a date. The atmosphere is romantic yet clubby for a modern and sheik clientele."
0,"Guy Fieri needs a slap in the face! \n\nThe Four Kegs has the worst customer service I have ever seen. The waitress we had was slooowww and very forgetful. It was as if she was on medication or something worse. We arrived during off peak hours for dinner, 9 pm. \n\nAfter a 45 minute wait the first  of five strombolis  made it to our table--all the strombolis arrived at different times (5-10 minutes apart). Very uncomfortable to watch other folks eat. One stromboli never made it to the table, we had to flag down our medicated waitress to check on the order (which she forgot to put in). Our waitress also forgot to put in our appetizer order--we reminded her and it came after the meal. \n\nThe one forgotten stromboli finally made it to our table AFTER everyone completed their meals, and it was ICE-COLD in the middle. \n\nThe manager never compensated us or apologized for THEIR screw-ups. Very disappointing.\n\nGuy Fieri should be ashamed of himself for highlighting this dive on TV, he lost a lot of credibility with all of us.\n\nOh, and the stromboli and appetizer (fried mac and cheese) was just average, nothing to brag about."
4,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!\n\nThis is the third time we've gone and have to say that from start to finish, everything is tasty fresh and the atmosphere is really great.  Hubby and I could probably eat here every weekend.  We took the kids last night (big sushi eaters) and this is their favorite place too.\n\nWe always start with the Edemame 3 ways - So good.  Its ot your run of the mill edemame.  One is lightly tossed in a southwest spice salt, one is in a soy type marinade and the 3rd is in a spicy aioli.  It lasted maybe 5 minutes.  We then asked to try the Crab Puffs - WOW.  They came right out of the fryer and were really hot but we were all burning ourselves to try and eat them because the taste was so good.\n\nSecond round consisted of their Bonzai sashimi's.  We ordered double orders of all three - Seared Tuna, Yellowtail. and Salmon.  They are all very different and the marinades plus the different salads they came with really compliment the sashimi.  The Seared Tuna is coated with ground pepper in a soy type sauce.  The salmon is paired with finely diced apples and nuts, and the yellowtail has a very thinly slided jalapeno plus another awesome sauce.  All 3 double orders were eaten so fast, not even our waiter Summer could believe it.\n\nFor rolls, we ordered the Southwest Ceviche, the Desert Rose (YUM), the Desperado (Yum with a little heat), the Vegas Roll (AWESOME) and the crowd pleaser the Country Fried Chicken Roll.  It seems a little wrong to be eating a non-sushi type roll in a sushi restaurant (we're a bit purist at times) but you can't help loving that roll -- served with a BBQ sauce you want to bath in...\n\nMartini's are great and my favorite is the Sheso Sexy (get it???) - it tastes like a cherry kiddie drink.  Hubby loves the Dirty Harry (Dirty Martini) which was really perfectly balanced.  \n\nI have no idea what the bad reviews were about - and if any of that did happen you should try this place again.  I have always found the waitstaff to be really really attentive - Summer has taken care of us 2 or 3 times and she's great.  They will take care of you will good food, good drink and good times.  I'm not a 5 star type person but this place really deserves it.  \n\nOne of the plaques on their wall had a great saying that I leave you with:  \""Man who steals wife's sushi gets no piece at home\""   Remember that, gentlemen!!"
2,"Never had a problem with the gasoline here, and it's cheaper in price than Smith's or other places in the immediate vicinity. I like the car wash fair enough, and there are vacuum cleaners available with car wash purchase. The store is always very busy but the cashiers were efficient and polite. The store seems to be clean enough. Far too often there are panhandlers scamming people, but there isn't much the property can do about it except tell the panhandlers to leave."
1,Never thought we need to pay to print boarding passes here been in most of the hotel elsewhere where the printing service is free.  hotel room looks ok. Newly renovated but the bathroom needs a major upgrade. price is very resonable for what your going to get so dont expect to much. I would recomend the hotel if your traveling in a budget. And not looking for much. Front desk staff looks very serious and are not very welcoming. Except for brian who checks us in Very sencere and polite. Over all my experience with the hotel was ok.
0,I base my rating on the first and last impression of this venue. Parking. Plan for an hour to get in and at least an hour to get out. We will never be back. This venue should be embarrased. Venues double the size can get patrons in and out faster.
3,"I love this place.  Yes, sometimes it's busy, but it's worth the wait.  The food quality and consistency varies a little bit depending on the time of day like all restaurants I've visited.  If you go in 10 minutes before closing on a slow night the food probably isn't going to be as fresh as it  is at noon on a peak day, but that's the restaurant business.  I originally loved the chicken, but now I'm a big fan of the sweet pork."
1,Meh!! This is a typical AZ hyped up joint. I have eaten here twice. Both times have left much to desire. First off the bread was toooo freakin thick. The meats are not very high quality in flavor or texture. I just don't get why people think it's sooo good. I have some good sandwiches in my life from some of the most famous in NY and LA to San diego and SF. This place sucks in comparison to most. Not my kind of place. Hell Miracle mile is 10 times better than this place and I don't really prefer that either but I would go there over this Silly dilly place!
4,"Amazing that a cafe like this can do great sushi, Italian pasta, and ramen!  Try the low carb soy noodles in your Italian dish.  Good stuff."
2,"A year ago I would have left a 4 star score but not today.  Recently Luigi's updated their menu, and the focus is now more on pizza.  Their pizzas are great but they have only 3 items under pasta.  There are many Italian restaurants in Madison that offer plenty of pasta options so having such a limited pasta section is not the smartest move.\n\nYesterday I went with 2 friends for dinner.  I ordered the spaghetti pie without the meatballs.  When I saw my bill I was a bit surprised to see they charged the same price for my dish.  If I knew that was going to happen, I would have asked for the meatballs on the side and given it to my one friend who is a meat eater.  Another disappointment was that they gave me a tiny (and I do mean tiny!) round piece of bread with my pasta dish.  What up with that?!\n\nOtherwise, the food was good.  All of us enjoyed our meals.  My one friend commented that the pizza she ordered (chicken with goat cheese and onions) was good but not as good as Grandpas Pizzeria on Williamson St.  The appetizer we ordered, the cheese and garlic bread, was absolutely fab!  We all commented that it is probably the best cheese bread we've eaten yet.\n\nI'll go back for sure.  The restaurant is small and quaint.  The menu is not cluttered which I prefer.  The prices aren't bad either.  For the 3 of us including tax came to $42 and change for an appetizer, 12 inch pizza, the Arthur salad, spaghetti pie, iced tea, diet pop and an italian soda.  Service was pretty good too."
4,"Whenever I visit Las Vegas I always make sure to stop by CASA FUENTE. A mojito and one of the house blend torpedos. Sitting in the patio watching Sportscenter on one of the TVs. Nice way to spend an afternoon. The nights are pretty cool too. Especially during the weekend of the BIG SMOKE in November. The prices are not cheap, but, IT\""S VEGAS BABY!!!!"
3,The service took a little extra time but the food was amazing! Get the iron skillet mac!
0,"Initiation Fees - Why?\nSimilar to You Fit who says $10 a month. Look out for the hidden fees!\nI went by this new gym when it opened with a coupon I received in the mail and the management refused to honor it.\n\nI go to Tangible Fitness. Locally owned \""No Hidden Fees & Reasonable Monthly Rates\"""
4,Sure - it looks like its better days are behind it.  But the work is great!\n\nThey care a lot and spend quite a bit of time getting it right.  I am quite particular.  \n\nEverything gets wiped down.  It's the third time I've been here. \n\nI'll definitely be back.
3,Very simple place.  I like that when i want Indian food i can just come in order and it would be ready with in minutes The price is fantastic and the flavors are very tasty.  It is also close to my house so thats a plus.  It is very clean on the inside and the employees are very nice.  I will be back to enjoy this great food.
3,"Been looking all over the Valley for someone to do cupcakes for a wedding.  I liked the stuff here.  \n\nIf I'm going to buy cupcakes rather than just make them myself, I want them to be: \nLarger than average\nDecorated nicer than I would have been able to do myself.\nHave interesting flavors\nBe a little on the fancy side\n\nThis place has all of that.  The stuff here is among the best you will find.  You'll like everything here (as long as you like icing).  The only place I have found that is better is Caketini (all the way in the SAN TAN village).  Caketini has a better ratio of cake to icing (rather than this place that has more regular size cupcakes with very fancy and large decorations). \n\nThis place has the most knowledgeable (and nicest staff).  It's decorated all girly and glittery.  Very cute.  Take your little girl with you and have some fun mom N daughter quality time, she'll just love it."
2,"good food. consistently slow and lousy service.  I had forgotten that it was nearly exactly a year since I'd been here,  and had the exact same experience (and my companions remembered too).  Very attentive manager,  but indifferent servers ... unbelievably slow.   It took an hour and a half since we arrived to go from order to meal.   Twice I had to get up and ask the manager about the status (oh and we ordered sushi, which doesn't need to be cooked!). \n\nFood was very good though.  So if you want great food without caring about the wait,  or attitude of the staff then Kona Grill is the place for you!"
3,"My favorite place to get breakfast. The staff is awesome, food is great and it won't kill the pockets! now I need to try something off the Lunch and Dinner Menu!"
2,This place is in the popular section of Old Montreal.  We had our first Monsieur Croquette - who knew a ham and cheese sandwich could be so tasty.  We also had the smoked salmon which was very satisfying.  The service was good and attentive.  The best part is the location and the view from the patio for people watching.
0,"wow. this is the worst place I ever order food from. 1st the food came cold, & when spoke to the manager Joey he said - WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST,  then he insulted me, & was as unprofessional as a manager could be. He thinks making excusing & insulting people is part of saying sorry. I would tell everybody do not order from this place, as long as this guy is in charge. He is a joke of a mamager."
3,"My husband and I stayed here in February 2012 for USA Sevens. We picked it because it was on the strip and was better priced and looked the cleanest then the other hotels. We stayed in the East tower , which I do recommend staying at because it's the newest part of the Luxor and the cleanest. The ONLY thing we really couldn't stand was how far the parking lot is to the tower. Between going through the entire casino, bars, and the whole pyramid to the other side it was horrible after a 9 hour drive with a bunch of luggage! The room it self was really nice, the desk chair was a bit dirty . But all in all we would stay there again. The Luxor buffet was the best one we've been to compared to a few others on the strip. It was clean and had great options for breakfast."
1,"Mediocre food and service.  Poor layout.  Some friends and I decided to head to Mercurio's on a whim.  Although many of the complaints revolve around the price of the food served here, I did not feel the costs were extraordinary.  I did, however, feel the food was mediocre.  I ordered the portobello salad that amounted to a huge over-salted pile of arugula with a measly mushroom on the side.  I also ordered the meat and cheese plate, which was adequate.  But, when we asked the waitress what cheeses were on the plate (1) she did not know and had to ask the kitchen and (2) after she asked the kitchen, she claimed there were 3 cheeses on the plate.  There were not 3 cheeses on the plate.  There were also little things that the waitress did that suggested a lack of attention and experience.  For instance, we asked for 3 glasses for the wine carafe because one my friends is clearly pregnant.  She brought 4.   We arrived a little after 5 and were seating immediately by the gelato counter.  Initially this was fine; but as the night wore on, the counter became increasingly busy and we ended up with rear ends at the backs of our heads."
1,"If I hadn't been born in Louisiana and my family wasn't cajun, I probably could enjoy it.  But when I go to a place that claims to be cajun and I see only pale shadows of the dishes, I come away disappointed.\n\nThis place seems more about the Look of what a non-cajun would expect out of cajuns than what being Acadian really is.  Nowhere to be seen is the wonderful dishes like maquechoux, and boudin, nor were the sides near what I like.\n\nAt least I still have relatives from Lafayette who send me good sausage to cook my own jambalaya and gumbo the right way."
3,"My coworker recommended Nadya.  I was looking for a place to go that was convenient to stop by on the way home from work. I haven't had anything hemmed in years, so I'm not sure how the prices compare. I had a pant leg hemmed shut where the stitches had come out, and a new zipper added to a pair of jeans, and it was $35.  They did a great job, and when I went back to pick them up she had me cracking up! She was helping another lady while I waited who must go there often, and they were laughing and the lady thanked her a bunch and hugged her goodbye. I think she has a great friendly personality! The only thing I was a little surprised about was prepaying, I wanted to wait to make sure everything looked good first.  They said so many people forget to come back that they have to charge up front. Nonetheless both pants turned out great!"
2,"Super hyped up and a big step up from most bubble tea places here in Waterloo. I like my bubble tea made from real fruit instead if syrup and powder. They use syrups here. The good thing is that their milk tea has a lot more tea flavour than other places. \n\nI have yet to try Noon Moment, so I can't compare. Chatime is just -really- expensive and you might have to line up for a little while. If you go, you might want to get your drink with less sugar because it's really sweet. I'm not sure I would go back to Chatime though."
2,"I used to give this place 4 stars but against my best wishes and hopes it now at a 3. The food has been hit or miss lately. But the service is totally messed up. I don't know what's happened but waiting times for something as simple as pulling the cork from my bottle to help buy time is poor. If you're going to take 20 minutes before giving me a menu, at least open my bottle. \n\nI have 3 other friends who feel the same way. I hope they clear this up soon."
4,"Best.time.ever! We did the Black Canyon horseback riding experience that included a BBQ. Our guide, Aaron, was a REAL cowboy! Loved it! Spent over 20 years handling horses from CO to AZ and back. He had on his cowboy hat, boots with spurs, plaid shirt with Marlboro reds in his pocket, and Wrangler jeans. My son was so happy at the authentic experience. He got to shoot a real pistol, lasso, throw a tomahawk, etc. Did you know they have a Cowboy camp? Yep. Awesome.\nThey offer the same experience in Sedona, so we can't wait to try that one."
2,"those that know me know i like to have a good time. \n\ni usually do.\n\nwent with a group of around 30, so yeah it was crazy.\n\nfor some strange reason, i just wasnt feeling this place. yeah the usual things youd find at a strip club are here..  cute to a few HOTT ladies walking around preying on drunk folks. random ass femalecustomer getting it on with a group of said ladies.... hella expensive ass drinks......\n\nbut strip clubs are like masturbation.... in the begining it all seems like a great idea, youre all excited and during, youre having a great time..... but after a few minutes after, you realized, damn i just fucked myself.\n \n+1 star for that cute stripper that actually seemed like she was enjoying chatting and took me over to an abandoned area not being used that night just to chat about random ass shit and not to clean me out of all my money."
2,It wasn't spectacular... Started 10-15 minutes late... The Comedian was the highlight of this show... I'm still googling her youtube videos with no luck... Some girls were really pretty but they weren't in sync much...
2,"The food was fine and the service is friendly, if not the most efficient. Not a place I would go out of my way for a return visit, but wouldn't rule it out if someone else suggested it."
3,"I've followed owner Johnny Chu through several of his Asian dining concepts, and I must say that this one is the best in its all-around atmosphere, bar setting, and tapas selection.  I still miss his influence over Fate, but Sens is sure to bring back the fun of Lucky Dragon in a more mature and sophisticated way.  This is definitely my pick for chic cocktail bar in downtown Phoenix.\n\nOh by the way.....  Don't try to order takeout.  They won't do it, and I respect that decision.  But I will say that Catherine was not happy that she couldn't get her soup dumplings last spring while she sat at home in the final days of pregnancy.  :-)"
2,"Like many things in Vegas the Irish bar Nine Fine Irishman at New York New York sounds much cooler than it really is, but the pub does provide an alternative Vegas experience. The bar is laid out like a house with plenty of secluded tables. At Nine Fine Irishmen, the Smithwick's Irish Red Pale Ale Beer is cold, the Jameson Whiskey free flowing, and the Irish band lively.\n\nOlivia Z. and I came to enjoy the band. It wasn't very busy, however, since there are only about 8 seats with a view the options are to stand & watch or find a table around the corner. We stood for awhile and then floated from table to table as better spots opened up. The upstairs was closed for a \""private event.\"" The outdoor patio provides even more space."
0,"The manager, or owner, of this establishment is horrible. Constantly closes earlier than advertised store hours and will sit and watch while you eat if he is ready to go. I mean within the 12 minutes of him closing at 2! 10 people tried to come in and he just ignored them. I mean seriously. Its Saturday and you close at 2! I don't get his business sense he is still paying the rent for the rest of the day, and I'm sure the people who were ignored will not be coming back and neither will I. I like corner bakery as a brand, but I hope this one goes under!"
0,"Since the BF moved to Phoenix last fall, I've been taking him on an informal tour of old school Phoenix eateries.  As part of our vintage dining tour, we finally make it to Katz Delicatessen & Sandwich Shop.  It definitely has an old school feel right down to the vintage diner interior.\n\nThe food was fine.  The bagels and cream cheese were good, but not outstanding.  Our lunches were serviceable, but forgettable.  It was amusing to watch the antics of the staff that outnumbered the diners at lunch by nearly 3:1.  With so many people out front, it appeared that there was only one short order cook and our food took way too long for simple deli offerings.\n\nThe real negative for me was the restroom.  I'm not expecting a marble shrine like the men's room at the Ritz-Carlton, but I want the rest room at a place that serves food to be clean and somewhat up to date.  The men's room at Katz was on par with some gas station restrooms that I have been unfortunate enough to see.  We're talking totally gross El Bano del Diablo here.  The dining room itself also needs a thorough cleaning, but the restroom was totally off-putting for me."
4,"Easily the best wings in Charlotte. We've come here two nights in a row now and haven't had any problems. Well, tonight my BLT came on Texas toast instead of a bun like I requested but to be honest it doesn't even matter. The food is awesome, the prices are right, and the atmosphere is great. Location is a bit odd but don't let that throw you off. Definitely go, get the wings with the honey gold sauce, have a $1.75 beer and relax."
4,"We have been going to Vicki / Precious Paws since we moved here 4 years ago and have not had ONE negative experience.  Sure there are closer groomers but not one that we could trust the way we trust Vicki with our little girl.\n\nShe gets really booked up so plan your visits, you won't be disappointed!"
0,"Awful Chinese food. Probably the worst place to eat asian in the whole neighbourhood. I ordered fried won tons and I got tiny crispy noodles that you're supposed to put in the soup. Furthermore, when they include veggies in their meat dishes, they just cut them into big pieces and barely cook them. I have so many examples of why this is place is bad and I could go on for an hour, but I won't. Oh, and I forgot to mention that when I went there to pick up my order, the cook sneezed in his hands and kept cutting food without washing them!!! I have to admit that their sweet and sour soup is good though, but it's not worth the shitty main course you'll get."
1,"Six of us dined prior to seeing Celtic Women last night.  Very disappointing, very!  Made our reservation 2 weeks prior to going to Bravo Franco.  Hostess wanted to seat 6 of us at a bar window!  Portions were ridiculously small on the Virginia Spots, three meals should have equaled one.  Mentioned this to the waitress and she did nothing to rectify.  Bread pudding dessert was not good.  Taste was bland and service mediocre.  Will not be going back, ever!"
2,"I'm not really sure how I feel about this place yet. I got the chili rellenos, and didn't really care for them...they had a funny windex flavored aftertaste. My hubby really liked his carne asada burrito though. They have a pretty wide variety of things you can order, so I'm willing to give this place another try. I really liked the green salsa (lots of garlic), the red was pretty average. The prices are reasonable. My hubby's burrito was big and full of steak that he really liked. I'll post again and re-rate after I try something else from here :) So, for now it can get a middle of the road."
1,"The domestic terminal has improved significantly since I was here about six years ago. And the improvements are impressive, especially free WiFi. There are two bad things about this airport: (a) if you fly into the international terminal and need to make a connecting domestic flight, you must exit the international terminal, walk about 15 to 20 minutes outside in the hot sun and reenter the airport and go through check in and security again; and (b) those money eating slot machines are everywhere to rob you of your coins and dollar bills. So, if you are bringing any duty-free alcohol from abroad and you are carrying your booze with you, they will make you discard your precious liquids, or you need to stick them inside your check in luggage (and hope, the bottles don't break)."
0,"We had a party of 5 celebrating a b-day! I am giving them 1 star not because of the food, it was because of waiting for over 1 hour for our food. After an hour of waiting and watching the other par tons leave because they can not wait, our appetizers came out then the soup. Then one by one our dishes came flowing out of the kitchen. The b-day girl insisted for us to wait, because to her the food is one of the BEST. The food was good, but not the BEST. Was it worth the hour wait? NO!"
1,"BlackFinn is like Buckhead Lite, if that makes sense. This place is literally like stepping into a good ol' boy frat house, maybe at Clemson or UNC. But as I've previously stated, this doesn't mean that the place isn't fun. It just means that you should know what you're getting yourself into when you head over there. Not a place to go for a casual drink, unless you're going midday or on a quieter night early in the week. \n\nLots of TVs in this huge bar, so it's a pretty decent place to watch a football or basketball game, especially since a lot of fans turn out here to check out their team. Located literally across the street from the Arena, it gets pretty packed before or after Bobcats games/concerts. It gets especially nuts on Friday and Saturdays, so be warned (or advised, if that's what you're looking to get into). \n\nThere's always a cover, which is a pain in the butt, but it's generally a good time if you're looking to really tie one on with friends."
4,"If one had asked me 10 years ago if I'd ever eat somewhere with the caliber and focus of an institution like Binkley's, I would have pondered for a minute and probably responded only if it was by the desire and grace of a girlfriend's sufficiently endowed parents or a reception catered by the Google Gillionaires I would surely be surrounded by as a result of a blossoming interest in the tech industry. If one had asked if I'd ever be there at the suggestion of my family who would be equally, if not more, at home at Claimjumper, I wouldn't have deigned the question worthy of response at all.\n\nI would have been (at least temporarily) wrong.\n\nAt the behest of a curious mother living nearby for years, we ventured. Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety, Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings, and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks:\n\n- Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame\n- Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine\n- Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home\n- Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus ($82 - $89, wine pairing $40-50 extra) like non-confused VIPs, but skipping the foie gras surcharge (+$14)\n- Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity\n- Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches\n- Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered\n- Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase, except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal\n- Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer, including a superb soft shell crab course\n- Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates\n- Starting to feel full around the penultimate course, an amuse of chocolate souffle \n- Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free ($2.50) despite the staff's complete lack of hesitation in providing them\n- Taking home satisfaction levels ranging from grudgingly enjoying the expensive dinner show to thinking it was the best overall food experience in months if not years\n\nMenu guidance would be a futile endeavor since, as the head waitresses helpfully informed all non-returnee tables, it turns over completely around every two weeks. However, overall, the seafood dishes were stronger than those with meat, of interest if one is opting for a menu with a single main. Instead:\n\n- Prepare for the onslaught of Kevin Binkley's culinary whims\n- Pretend the a la carte menu doesn't exist\n- Make a reservation well in advance, especially for a weekend\n- Bring your wallet, possibly two\n- Expect to spend at least 3 hours luxuriating over the meal\n- Sigh longingly while realizing how far in the future the next justifiable visit will be\n\nRegardless of apprehension, except in the face of a diet with statistically outlying strictness, it's worth trying once for a special occasion to form one's own opinion. While I could easily think of a number of small tweaks, the application of the formulaic main draw is, in Yelp's terms, semantically indistinguishable from as good as it gets."
2,"It's a new small place, clean, order at the counter fresh fish fry. They had several types of dips and the french frys were good. No beer :( sad hope that's too come soon. There was plenty served in one serving didn't need more. Husband wished his was crisper and wanted Texas toast.  Fish was white and very good. Coleslaw ok.  Hope they stay and grow - we'll be back."
3,"Stopped back by Mellow Mushroom with my mate Justin from Brew Bros. & a few of our mates Monday afternoon while pub crawling on a day off.  \nFirst I must say my return trip was motivated by an immediate response from to my 1st Yelp review from Mellow Mushroom's owner Jay.  I didnt expect any reponse, much less a return so quickly. Respect for that. Great to see to someone paying such close attention to their customers.\nThis can only be a good thing.\nThe same draft selection as the first time around.  48 Handles.  Thats a lot of beer.  As said in my first reiview, with 48 handles I would Love to see more variety and a bit more imagination with respect to the draft beer choices, then again who would complain about a selection w/ at least 40 craft beers on tap?   Thats a real commitment. \nOur bartender Madison was enthusiastic about what she was serving which in Arizona's growing craft beer community is a big plus.  On a another note, this time around the food I ordered made it out of the kitchen rather quickly.  Just a mediterainan salad, but nice.\nAll said, great to see another craft beer brother join the club.  Nice to have you here."
1,"When I went to the recently opened Panera on Friday evening, I knew we were in trouble when my young friend ordered the chicken noodle soup in a bread bowl. \""We're out of bread bowls,\"" snapped the staff member taking orders. My friend, who had been yearning for soup in a bread bowl ever since she heard about it, finally settled on a classic salad with chicken and I ordered a Thai chicken flat bread sandwich. We made our way down a narrow passage way into the table area. The decor is blah with bad lighting and none of the empty tables had been wiped off. While waiting for our food, I went to the restroom, which clearly had not been recently cleaned and a huge cylinder of toilet paper was set on top of the empty dispenser. Our food arrived and the person in charge of the kitchen must have been friends with the decorator -- blah. Granted the prices are cheaper than Paradise and the excellent Wildflower but for a lot less money we stopped at Frys on the way home and bought a La Brea Olive Oil and Rosemary round loaf and a can of Progresso chicken noodle soup. Now that was a tasty mean!"
1,"Had high expectation, so wanted to like this place, was quite disappointed. So so service, ok ambience, food was bad. A good test is how well the lamb kebab is prepared, I had to send it back and get something else as it was super chewy like rubber, disappointing!"
1,"This place gets 2 stars because of the amenities!!! The pool area was worth a lot more than our massages. We got a 50 minute couples massage which was $300, they automatically add your 20% tip in (which I don't agree with considering I am in a customer service based occupation) the spa is beautiful, but there was no area to see each other prior, men's and women's areas are separated, and it seemed very rushed. We both asked for deep tissue and got nothing of the sort. The massage was lackluster and frustrating. I have very bad knots in my shoulders and she never even rubbed my shoulders, so I walked away with so sense of relief?!?! I would not go back to this spa, even if we come back for future trips with the timeshare. I will likely find another spa in scottsdale off of the JW Marriott resort."
1,"We went to this place as usual and were surprised to see a \""shrunken\"" happy hour menu. We ordered calamari and lobster tacos and were unhappy with these orders. They had no taste and were overlooked. It seems to us the quality of this place is going down!! Sad for that given the fact we are regulars!!!"
2,"Ok so before you go here just be warned that the parking lot is a MESS!  Worst parking lot in AZ (and there are some bad ones).  Also beware that you will wait LONG for your food (think 45 min-1 hour).  Having said that I don't mind waiting for good food.  Also, this place is open only for lunch so make sure you check to hours before heading over there (I have made this mistake twice before finally catching the place when they were open).  \nThe food is good.  I had the grilled ham and cheese with jalapeno.  It was really tasty and the mixed greens are pretty tasty too.  I also got some macaroons to go.  The chocolatey ones were really good, but the fruity ones kinda tasted like floor cleaner.  Not my favorite :-/\nOverall this place is OK.  Good food, OK macaroons, and OK service.  Worth checking out if you are in the area."
0,"The place gets 1 star for several reasons, most of all for trying to serve crap under the guise of freshly prepared tapas. One such example is their so called spanish tuna which they get from the can and afterwards add some sliced tomatoes and serve it to customers. I come from a cultural background where many of those eastern European dishes are common in our household so I know what those things ought to taste like, I cant say they were terrible but it was definitely not worth the price. Also having gone to Barcelona myself their so called jamon iberico was just another sliced up pork and nothing like the iberico from Spain. The squid stuffed with its ink came semi warm and had a nasty fish taste to it rather than what they make you believe. a combination of bad food, bad service, trying to make you believe that their food is something it's not (dishonesty) gets this place the 1 star review. It's no wonder that we were the one of two tables occupied in the whole place. Stick with firefly and your will be a lot more happier."
2,"Croissant wasn't that good. I like bouchon bakery croissant better. The red velvet taste like chocolate, but the presentation decor of each cupcake is amazing. \nMy fave is the fruit tart."
4,"Had a great dinner at Elephant Bar last night! \n\nGot a coupon in the mail for 2 meals and an appetizer for $20! While they did limit the  selections you could get with the coupon, we were happy with the choices so it worked out fine.\n\nFood was delicious and the service was fantastic! Waitress was very attentive and polite.\n\nLocation was a plus too! Had a lovely walk around The District shops afterward. \n\nAll and all, a hands down 5 stars!"
4,Great food lots of portion!
2,"Typical BoA branch set up near South Park Mall.  It's located at the corner of Fairview and Barclay Downs so there is a traffic light to help you turn left and then into the parking lot.  Ample enough parking spaces and the building is shaped like a pie wedge so it makes for an interesting entrance (at the tip).\n\nA walk up ATM is located at the front for 24hr access as well as a drive thru ATM.  I've never seen anyone use the teller windows (drive through), but they may be phasing those out as the tellers are being replaced by machines."
1,"Ok for the price. The french onion soup and pot pie soup were tasty. The sandwich was something I can make at home. Nothing exciting here folks but at least there are vegan options and the produce is fresh. The chips are like a more greasy Ruffle so I left most of those on my plate. \n\nWhile we were here we sat at the corner table near the restroom and one of the employees walked around the corner cursing in Spanish. I didn't think anything of it until a minute later when our table was flooded! My shoes were soaked on the bottom and the water gushed out the door and into the parking lot, gushing further into the restaurant and street. Hilarious but unfortunate event. Whatever plumbing issues aside, I still enjoy other sandwiches and chips over Jason's Deli.\n\nThey also have catered a fundraising event at work and they wrapped very simple ham and cheese sandwiches with store bought loaf bread. Very weird thing to do, considering their sandwiches in store are way better and what better way to represent than serve your best? Meh."
1,"This was my second time here. My first experience was great but this time around, not so much.I asked the waiter what is the difference between Al Ajillo and Al Mojo de Ajo, he answered that it is the same thing, that it was just a misprint on the menu. He said its just garlic salt, pepper and a little spice. So I ordered a steak with shrimp al mojo de Ajo but when i received the plate it was covered in a wine sauce. A wine sauce that was supposed to be reduced but instead was watery.The waiter never even mentioned it had wine and there was so much it ruined the meat, rice, etc. My husband let the waiter know of our disappointment but we never received an apology from him. We did receive great service from other staff members but that isn't enough to make me go back to this restaurant. People do seem to enjoy the atmosphere here but I prefer to enjoy my food and this place couldn't do that for me."
2,"I struggled thinking about how to review Brother's Italian Bistro. The food is delicious, full of flavor and garlic knots are amazing. I order take out and delivery when I'm in the mood for amazing Italian food. I do, however, have an issue with some staff and management. They have a scrappy attitude, sometimes unhelpful on the phone with food questions, which makes online ordering praise worthy..and limits contact with the staff. It's very sad because customers make and support the business. 5 stars for food, 2 stars for attitude. Fix your customer service....."
3,"5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for the service. \n\nMy fellow Yelpers, you did not disappoint. My friend and I came here after reading reviews on Yelp. We always like to try new things, so this was a perfect opportunity. \n\nI had the Billionaire Burger, and yes, it is DEFINITELY worth the $28!! After California banned foie gras, I was heart broken. I didn't know when I will be able to eat it again, so when I saw the Billionaire Burger on the menu, I had to get it!\n\nThis burger is made with kobe beef, FOIE GRAS, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo. This burger is packed with a punch of flavor and textures that all mesh so well together. I usually get cheese on my burgers, but I opted out this time since there's so many flavors going on already. If you absolutely need some cheese, I'd probably recommend a mild cheese like provolone or gruyere. \n\nWhen the burger was set down in front of me, my jaw just about dropped to the floor. There was a HUGE piece of grilled foie gras on my burger. I was expecting small pieces or even just a pate version, but no, I was wrong. The foie gras was so creamy and the truffle mayo was so earthy and packed a punch. There was small pieces of truffle in the mayo! You definitely get the bang for your buck here. The burger came with a choice of shoestring fries (which I recommend since they are so crunchy) or steak fries. \n\nAnother tip. If you check in with Foursquare, you get a free house draft beer or margarita. I don't know how long this offer lasts, but give it a try. \n\nFor the service, it was just non existent. Our server took so long to take our orders. We sat at the table for about 10 min after she took our order to get our drinks. I think she just wasn't in the mood to be at work, but still, you can't let the customers know that. \n\nAll in all, yes, I definitely felt like a Billionaire eating that burger, and that burger was probably the best fancy burger I had in my life! I can't wait til I go to Vegas again."
1,Food is ok. Could definitely be better. Their gumbo is actually very good. It is not a very good place to have a casual drink. The layout is very poor and the bartenders are horrible. They don't work the bar and seem annoyed when people order a drink.
4,"Love hiking in Spur Cross Ranch! If you are looking for a place that feels completely disconnected from the normal world with only the sound of nature, and very few people around, this is the place. It is a bit of a drive once you turn off the main street but it's a very pretty drive. The amount of cactus and greenery here is outstanding and the views are beautiful. There are easy trails and hard trails, and it's easy to get lost in a nice sort of way (aka it's not that hard to find your way back to the trail). Some of the trails go by a creek, which actually does have a good amount of water after a rain. \n\nAfter hiking in Spur Cross its easy to get a bite, a cup of coffee, or some beers in the quaint town of Cave Creek."
1,Other than a couple waitresses with big jugs this place doesn't have much to offer. The food is bland and over priced. Only positive thing I can say is that that they warm up their muffins.
0,Never again. Wish I had read these reviews first.
4,"I went to Las Vegas for my best friend's bachelorette party and we surprised her with Sin City Cupcakes.. It was awesome !!! She loved them !!! The cupcakes were surprisingly good too! We ordered the \""better than sex\"" and  \""pink pussycat\"", both were great. I wish they delivered to Texas!"
1,If you like Richardson's you should go there because this place is a cheap knockoff.  The decor is tacky and the carne adasada has no flavor. The bacon wrapped shrimp were dry and charred like a spent ember.  Two stars because the waitress was at least friendly.
1,"We visted this place several years ago and throughly enjoyed it. I would have rated it 3.5-4 stars back then.  Oh how the mighty have fallen. On our recent trip we had dinner here and it was bad!  Alot of the food was old and cold. The king crab legs tasted like salt licks and a large number of other dishes were too scary looking to try. The prime rib and desert section was Aria's only saving grace. The gelato was housed in a revolving freezer that sort of reminded my of a Ice Cream Pistol LOL.  Avoid eating here as this is no longer a good buffet.  There is an all you can drink option for beer and wine for $12.99.  I suppose if you drink enough the food might taste better LMAO\n\nThe lobster shown in photos is availble on Fridays and I think Saturday, the price is considerably higher and you are limited to 1/2 lobster tail per person."
2,"So, I have this weird affliction that makes me feel really uncomfortable when someone puts a HUGE plate of food in front of me. I wanted the chile rellenos, but not the supersized plate! Alas, such is the state of dining in most restaurants these days, but seriously, if I would have known the portions were this big I would have shared my dinner with my friend.\n\nStill, for Vegas we got a table on a Friday night with no wait and no reservation, the service was very attentive, and the bill was reasonable. My mojito was quite tasty also. So go, share, and enjoy!"
1,"Walked in and had the place to myself!! Yes!! And the sushi chef is nowhere to be found sooo sitting at the bar by myself. \n\nShould've went to Wahoos\n\nService sucks, took 5 minutes before the sushi chef came out\nAnd he took the order of the only other people that were sat later. They are speaking Japanese though so maybe they know something I don't?\n\nHad to ask for everything:water, saucer for soy sauce, even those main trays they give you with the wasabi and ginger on it. Sure I get it if you were busy but it's just me, that coupke and one other guy. Eh. I need Goyemon to was this craptastic experience out of my mind."
3,"This bar is somewhat of a sexy situation. \n\nWith a greenlit entrance that makes you feel like you're entering somewhere slightly forbidden (or maybe Oz) and a mysterious pineapple logo...it'll definitely lure you in. \n\nThe spread of tropical drinks were on point\u00e8 (such creative combinations and lovely presentation). The bartenders are very sweet (ask for Val!). The music soundtrack was solid. Place was a lil' empty, but I imagine it's great on happening nights too. Definitely hit up MN for a sultry and chill time!"
1,"Just went once, and once is enough. I had a slice of the veggie pizza. Who knows how long it was sitting there, as I just went to the express side. It was just ok. Pretty tasteless and the crust was really hard and bland. I sat at the bar on the express side, there was a lot of crumbs covering the surface. It wasn't busy so I'm not sure why it hadn't been wiped down. The cashier seemed to be just going through the motions, super average place at best."
2,"I had brunch here with some friends.  The food here is good, but very pricey.  Service is good.\n\nThe bread was good.  The beignets were good as well.  My main dish was the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was tasty and juicy.  The waffles were unmemorable, but solid.  Portion sizes were pretty good and I left the establishment full.\n\nI expected more from a Thomas Keller restaurant - while the food was good, it was not overly memorable, which I was expecting given the relative high price and the Thomas Keller brand name."
0,I have never been so insulted as a patient.  I spent around a hour in the waiting room. ...I was with two different employees for a total of less than 10 minutes. I did see a stethoscope....\n\nThe bill for services was $255....you've got to be kidding. ...that's criminal. ...
3,"One of the larger and nicer Marshall's stores I've been to and possibly the cleanest one in town. They offer name brand and designer clothing at pricing much below standard retail and I love shopping here because there are usually good deals to be found, especially in the clearance section if you can find your size. Notable features of this store include a large shoe and home selection, as well as plenty of cell phone accessories, and in the men's section there are a decent selection of suits, dress shirts and ties. There was a pretty decent line going at the register when I walked in but it was gone by the time I was ready to check out, so the employees here are pretty efficient. We used to live in the area and now occassionally stop by whenever we're in the area because of the variety of items and size of store here compared to other locations."
2,"i visited on jan 19 and ordered the thai basil (their signature dish) with calamari, which had a very unique flavor that was a bit masked by the spiciness. i'm a wimp when it comes to spices, and i was overwhelmed by the medium i ordered. though the dish was very good, it was, for a dish dish consisting mostly of vegetables, on the scant side for 11.95. \n\nmy friend ordered a curry, and it was a sizable portion, presented in a clay pot. i sneaked a bite, and it was very good too.\n\nthe place is comfortable and intimate, with booths and tables, and the wait staff is very friendly."
1,"Thought we'd try to stay closer to home and saw the reviews for this place, not so bad. Was greeted by a super friendly guy who quickly changed from friendly to downright annoying. He took our drink orders as soon as he seated us, was back in a flash and asked if we needed more time. Yes, we did. Two minutes later, asked if we were ready. Nope, sorry. Again. And again. I don't know what his hurry was but he was determined to get our order within 5 minutes of us walking in the door. Whatever. \n\nI ordered the house chicken. When it arrived I was surprised, they give you a lot of food! I thought I had hit the jackpot! It was crispy, not overly sweet or spicey. Very good. We had a lot of leftovers, everything turned out great.\n\nUntil about 5 hours later. I was pretty gassy after that but whatevs, I don't mind farting and I'm pretty gassy anyways. Then it became painful. I knew it was coming and it was going to be hot. I got the shits. Explosive. Seven times. \n\nIt's hard to tell what exactly has turned your ass into a chocolate fountain by the end of the day...but I won't risk it again."
3,"I went here during my 21st birthday weekend with a group of friends..I wasn't too sure where we should go to have a nice dinner, so I went w/ the concierge's reccomendations and he booked us a reservation that very night for my group of 10 at Enoteca San Marco.  We had a nice spot \""outside on the patio\"" it was really nice.\n\nI think everyone enjoyed their meal..the service at first was so-so, but I think they started to attended to us for the most part.  I definitely reccomend getting the cheese platter for a nice appetizer...it was paired with some honey and fresh blueberry sauce and it was sooo good! I had the margherita pizza..it was definitely Italian style with the fresh ingredients and the thin crust. It went really well w/ the wine we ordered too. I definitely wouldn't mind coming back here for some yummy Italian food. =)"
0,"Worst customer service experience I can remember.\n\nWe sat down at a blackjack table and were completely ignored by the dealer, Lisa. We watched her deal four or five hands to the gentleman that was already sitting at the table when we got there without her even looking at us or saying a word. When we repeatedly asked if we could get chips for the money which we had on the table she didn't even acknowledge us. It was quite surreal.\n\nI asked a manager on the floor what was going on and he said that he didn't know and that there was nothing he could do!? I then spoke to his boss, Albert. All Albert was able to tell me was that he was sorry and that he would buy me a drink. I told him that was unacceptable and that I wanted to know why I was treated so rudely. He made no effort to talk to the dealer or check the tapes and did not take down my contact information to resolve the issue the following day. I felt his tone was condescending and dismissive.\n\nI don't recall ever being treated so rudely by an employee or being disregarded so bluntly by management in my life. I will not be going back to the Talking Stick Resort & Casino ever again."
3,"Pleasantly surprised! \n\nService was upscale. Ambiance was ok. It was a bit noisy and there were many more kids than I would have imagined. A lot of AZ tuxedos (polo/button down and shorts with sandals). \n\nIt was cool to see the chefs cooking your meal in front of you! We had a white sangria and a strawberry margarita. Both were very good, but I don't think my marg had much tequila. \n\nThe cheese plate was exceptional, the pairings were spot on. Be careful, the blue cheese is very strong, so that might be off putting for some. We both like a good funky cheese so it was all good. My fave was the goat cheese and tomato spread.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the chicken and the man ordered the ribeye. My chicken was surprisingly very delicious and moist, as were the sides. My green beans were a little crunchy for me, but still good. The steak and gouda mac were fabulous! High quality beef cooked very well.\n\nWe skipped dessert.\n\nThe layout of the menu didn't make sense. They have a burger and a pasta dish under appetizers.. Maybe they need to divide that section into apps and small plates."
4,"Lovely...swimming in the pool with that amazing view alone is worth the trip.   Maybe you'll be as lucky as I was and a hummingbird will fly next to you to have a drink from the pool... Heaven, no: Paradise Valley!"
3,"This place was great when it was Oasis and is still pretty good and one of my favorites on the strip. They use to be the cheapest, but since renovations, I think pricing is more in line with the strip.  I'm not quite sure what was experienced by the individual that felt they weren't clean.\n\nI like the layout and attention to areas for relaxation. That makes it better than Mirage which doesn't quite have enough space for the chill out and Canyon Ranch which is more oriented toward being a Gym. The lighting is wonderful through out, low enough to make you feel at peace.  Also, the ability to grab water and hydrate or to put cucumber on your eyes in multiple places is fantastic.  \n\nIf you are like me and go to the spa to lounge around for multiple, hours, Nuture is a good one to put on the list. \n\nI still think that the strip doesn't quite pay enough attention to spa in general, so I can't give it the full 5.  I mean, go to Asia (half of the Casinos have properties there anyway), check it out and come back and implement all the details. \n\nThe only thing I would additionally mention, the spa is FAR from the parking area or entrance areas.  You've got a trek if you're not staying at the luxor.  Make sure to give yourself a lot of extra time for your appointment to get to the actual spa."
4,Free entrance if you print coupon from their website
3,"I write this quick review as I sit in the parking lot trying to not tear open my container, because it smells so good!\n\nFood is fresh so fresh you might have to wait for certain meats but, its definitely worth the wait \n\nI came at a good time so I avoided \""the line\"" which came shortly after I placed my order..the inside can get a little cramped but orders move out pretty fast. \n\nI'm sure I'll be back just judging off the smell I ordered the 2 meat combo tip/brisket mnc &baked beans \n\nI had to have a quick taste of a rib tip ...I can no  longer say Vegas doesn't have a good place for Bbq \n\nPerfect flavor and tenderness"
3,I love Lisa's Bowl of Balls.  It is a very yummy and satisfying dish.  I go to Lisa G's just for her meatballs when I'm craving meat.  I highly recommend this dish.
1,"just had a gate installed for my courtyard, if the company ever responds to my e-mail I will update this review.\n\nThe sales person and myself visited a similiar home in the neighborhood that had a gate that was similiar to what I was looking for, the sales person said this isn't our gate but we'll do a much better job.\n\nSo after a bit a negotiation we agreed on price, the installers didn't seem to know what they were doing, instead of using a stud finder they just kept drilling holes through the stucco hoping to find one...they thought they did but it turned out to be a cross brace and they didn't notice this until they had already shaved off about 1/2 inch of stucco then when they realized they hadn't hit a stud they decided to move the gate in about 3 inches and again shaved off more stucco.  The frame of the gate appears to be to big for the gate and it never looks like its closed all the way.\n\nThey did patch some of the stucco but still left some drill holes and large gaps on the sides of the frame that should have been filled in.  I don't believe they ever did hit a stud and used another technique to secure the gate.\n\nLike I said if they make this right I will upgrade my rating but if I don't get a response, i'm going to the BBB and the ROC"
2,"It's cheap, the margaritas are huge, they serve breakfast tacos all day (proper breakfast tacos, not Taco Bell's waffle nonsense), and you can sit on the patio with a giant drink and a plate of breakfast tacos, feeling vaguely like an expatriate who ought to be listening to Mexican radio. It's the next best thing to being in Tijuana eating barbecued iguana. (I can't swear there isn't an iguana taco -- have another 'rita and go take a look, 'kay?)\n\nIt's a \""scene\"" restaurant, as most things on Mill Avenue are, so not the thing if you're feeling incapable of coping with sudden, loud noises, many of them made by inebriated undergraduates. If you go at a dead-ish time of day, it's not in-your-face loud. The staff are perky and patient while you figure out the menu for the first time, and they don't go nuts over trying to turn tables if there isn't a crowd. This is counter service -- order up front, pick up the food in the back when called -- so it's pretty low key.\n\nThe breakfast tacos are pleasant, more than life-changing. If you have a serious problem with fairly well-done scrambled eggs, ask up front to have them runnier or order something else, as these are quite well-done eggs. In the future, I would stick to variations where there's something greasy like chorizo to counter the stiffness of the eggs. These tacos are very generous -- I thought I was starving and couldn't finish a plate of two with the accompanying Latin potatoes (which are very nice) and refried beans (which are generic).\n\nAs far as Mexican restaurants of this sort -- silly name, self-conciously funky decor, waitresses in tight shirts, very large drinks, loud music, okay food -- go, this is a bargain with a nice view of the neighborhood."
3,"I've only eaten here once so far but I like it.  I had the Thai Peanut sandwich and the tomato basil soup.  I thought the sandwich was very good and unlike the other review regarding the tomato basil soup, I really enjoyed it.  The food is good and I enjoy the colorful appearance from the outside.  In fact, that's what drew me to the place.  I'm usually on my way to Paradise Bakery or Firehouse Subs when I'm in this parking lot but the flashy and colorful lights drew us in and we liked what we found inside."
2,"Drive thru is 24 hours except late nights they're under staff which is really annoying because every time I come here around 11pm or later it always takes about 15-30 minutes to get my order. This has happened 3 times already, to the point where I just put my car on park and the car behind me would turn off their engine. Not sure why they only have 1 girl working at night, there's something wrong with that. Other than that my smoothie was great, just not happy with how slow the service is at night!"
4,"OH XS, why must you be so amazing!?\n\nRight off the bat, the vibe is upbeat and people are lookin' good! You walk through the doors, up the stairs, and as soon as you you turn that corner, BAM! A vision like no other! It's breath taking and when I show my friends this club for the first time, I love the look on their faces when they see this view! You can either go straight to the dance floor or go either right or left to outside or a bar..  \n\nPoles are scattered along the club for dancing and to top it off they have two platforms with poles. I am not going to say that I am in favor of those poles, but only in favor to see some females display the level of intoxication!! Hey, it's Vegas, what do you expect!?\n\nFeel like gambling!? Don't worry, XS has it covered! Walk along the patio seating and along the pool where you will find another bar and a \""Party Pit' if you will.... One craps table and a couple blackjack tables as well! Of course, while actively gaming, your drinks are on the house!!\n\nI celebrated my birthday here last year and got the best service! Huge table and they even brought me a birthday cake! What girl doesn't like firework-like candles on her birthday cake!? My girlfriends and I danced the night away and what was great was that there was security always watching us. In Vegas, there are always groups of girls that go to clubs and it was nice to have a big buff guy there to keep an eye out!\n\nMusic is loud and everywhere you look, people are having a great time! Staff is easy on the eyes and move as quickly as they can! The staff keeps this place clean as it is the most beautiful club in Vegas. I expect nothing less from a club located in a 5 star 5 diamond resort.\n\nDebating on going? Don't! You will have a blast! I believe the doors open at 10. If I were you, get on a guest list. The line gets pretty long!"
3,My favorite ramen on the Eastside! So glad I don't have to go all the way to Chinatown to get some great ramen. Our server is always so nice and sweet & she practically knows me already! My favorite is the Fukumimi Ramen with thick noodles and extra egg! YUMMMMM!
3,I've been to Oscar's several times and keep going back because the food and service is fantastic.  They are very attentive but not overly so.  The view of downtown is amazing from the restaurant--although it is a bummer they have that new zip line that blocks a good portion (not the restaurant's fault by any means).\n\nI always get the filet mignon butterflied well done and they do it perfectly!  The garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus are delicious sides as well.  The dinners here are just so so good. My husband ordered the salmon and I don't even like fish but it looked delicious as well.\n\n The only thing I don't care for is the bread--it has scallions and stuff inside it and I'd rather have plain bread.\n\nIf you go to Vegas this place is worth eating at.
0,"My family went there for dinner for the first time tonight and it was a TERRIBLE experience. The service and the overall presentation of the restaurant were decent. The food, however, was so bad that everyone got a stomach ache. I think we all had food poisoning. The food was also either bland or very salty. We did not try the Mongolian grill section, so I cannot speak on behalf of that. Will I go back, no."
4,"Excellent service. No problems. Free upgrade and one of the sales associates took me home when she got off work.  If I need to rent another car, I will definitely come here again."
1,"My husband and I went to see Jerry Seinfeld at Comerica. First problem is that while he stood in line for beer, I had to stand in another line for liquor. And turns out, the line I was standing in wasn't even for liquor, but beer and some other random malt beverage. The liquor line was on the opposite side from the beer - it would be nice if people had a little more info.\n\nThe bartender that was running the liquor portion was ridiculously slow. I mean, so slow the wife of the guy in front of me left to go stand in line at the bathroom and came back before their drinks were made. OMG.\n\nThe seats are super tiny, very close together and pretty much have zero leg room. I'd hate to be tall and be sitting there. I wanted another drink but I didn't want to get up for fear of having massive leg cramps and not being able to walk back.\n\nOur view was decent, however the sound quality was terrible. Every time someone would talk into the microphone, it would echo all over the place and so we were listening to each joke twice."
3,"You can get anything and everything you can get from Costco in behemoth size.  I usually wouldn't write about a chain, but this Costco has to be one of the better organized and there are an abundant amount of workers to help you out.  Be prepared to spend at least $100.  You think you only need a few things, but you keep adding up more.  On this particular occasion for whatever reason, I spent more than $400.  I was definitely packing it in for the winter hibernation.  Lastly, they have their food court indoors, which is essential considering your food or icre cream would wither away in the 110 degree heat."
0,"This place is AWFUL. I have NOTHING nice to say about the Orleans!\n\nBack in December I went to a UNLV basketball game here. I stopped at the Mardi Gras bar before the game to grab a beer with my friends while we waited for the game to start. After drinking the entire beer, I glance at the bottom of my glass, only to find a THICK white film with 7 or 8 dead maggots INSIDE of the glass. After gagging profusely, I spoke to the Food & Beverage Manager, who had me fill out a report with security. I WISH I could post pictures here and show you what filth the Orleans serve to their customers! The response from the bartender who served me? \""My bad.\"" The response from the Food & Beverage Manager? \""Well, I'm sure it's nothing that will kill you.\"" Ummm, what?!?! Considering that NO ONE from The Orleans has tried to contact me to make sure that I actually didn't die from their foul casino and lax sanitary standards, how would they know?? I actually spent the next day vomiting, but I'm sure they don't actually care. \n\nFirst and last time I will ever set foot in this place. I filled out a report, they had all of my contact information - no one thought that maybe a phone call saying, \""I'm really sorry this happened to you\"" would have been in order? Thanks for nothing, Orleans!"
3,"man talk about balance I had dinner @ Yasu today and it was great. The service was on the money, the server knew the dishes and helped me navigate to find what I wanted to eat and the food didn't disappoint. I didn't have any sushi since I wanted to try other things and I'm glad I made that choice. The restaurant is small but comfortable, welcoming and just has a good vibe. I agree with kkdat with allot of her recommendations (by the way the beef tongue was great) I was impressed with the attention to detail. the miso was tasty but you must try the salads they are some of the best that I have had in the valley. With a little bit of refinement I think they will be a sure bet 5 star restaurant sooner or later...."
1,This place in general is a little too cheesy for me.  They offer mediocre seafood with over the top waitstaff.  The waitstaff remind me of the movie Office Space where they try to be overly excited that you are there.  It is almost like you are buying a used car.   \n\nI will start with the food.  It is very messy and drizzled in butter.  Don't wear any good clothes or risk having butter splotches all over.  The food itself is just ok.  Nothing to write home about.  \n\nThe on-tap beer selection is less than desired.  If you like mass produced beers then you are in luck.  \n\nI would say save your money go to a locally owned restaurant where you won't be subjected to all of the cheesiness.
3,Get the streak frites.  That is all you need to know.
1,"This place is close to my house, so I go occasionally when I just need a Mexican food fix. However, I have not had a consistent experience. Sometimes the food and service are decent, sometimes just the food, sometimes just the service. Totally hit or miss. But I like the small town restaurant feel of this place and perhaps that's what keeps me coming back every few months or so. Definitely experienced better, but most definitely have experienced worse."
4,"My family has been bringing pets here for 20 years. Dr. Hauck is a FANTASTIC veterinarian! He is patient and gentle with the animals, and very kind to the owners. \nThey do a variety of things: boarding, spay/neutering, tail docking, ear cropping (Our Doberman), inoculations, etc. \nI wouldn't take my pets anywhere else beside Dr. Hauck!!!\n\n*He treats birds too!\n**The staff is very helpful and kind too!"
0,"I fly into Vegas once a year to make a trip to Utah to visit friends.  I rent a car each time but this was my first experience with Dollar and will probably be my last.  Yes, they came in the low end with the rates but still I was under the impression most rental cars were 'new'.   The car I had was 2 years old and the filthiest rental car, I've ever had.  The seats and steering wheels were sticky with soda spills.  The car also had a strange odor.  But worse, a couple of times along my trip the car sputtered but seemed to run ok.  I told the guy when I turned the car in about the sputtering but he seemed unconcerned.  The rental wound up costing twice the price quoted due to all the added fees and a mandatory insurance but that seems to be the case no matter what rental agency I use."
3,"This is a great complex that offers enough shade to keep you from getting too much sun, misters to keep you cool (if wanted to step in the direction of!) A bar/grill that isn't anything great BUT nice having the choice of having a little better selection of food other than game food; hotdog, pretzel, soda, ect..  I like the layout, I LOVE the future plan of a field for the disabled children (so so neat), and I liked the cleanliness of the bathrooms/complex.... MINUS the no clean at all bar area. Everything about being up on the deck/in the bar was very dirty. First off a dead baby bird on the deck (REALLY?! EWW) and the doors/everything you touch having horrible horrible amounts of dirty finger prints/sweat caked on. Yes, I understand it was a busy day for softball but a little touching up throughout the day...... Not hard."
4,"This place is hands down the go to place. I am reading reviews on the quality of their items and that makes no sense at all and here is why.\n\nWe have been going to this place for over 10 years and hundreds of Las vegans do the same and for a reason. The way they work is you go look at the bog shops like Walker and RC Willey, and Ashley, and find what you like, take a photo and get the info on the tag and bring it to them and they will get it for less cause they skip the middle man and have lower overhead. Its that simple folks.\n\nNOTE:The people writing they got junk, well chances are they ordered the cheapest way available plain and simple. \n\nIf you order a mattress they ill tell you do you want basic, better, best, or one of a kind, its Just like with every product, you get what you pay for and you can get bottom of the barrel or top quality, the beautiful part about them is you have a choice.\n\nThey also have a beautiful showroom full of nice items to look. They also have hundreds of books to look through to find your perfect item. They can get you just about anything and for cheaper. We have been going to them for so long we don't even need to go to the big boxes and we just order from the mag and about a week later we get it.\n\nThe business is owned by a family that cares and remembers the small details. If your looking for cheap made stuff they can get it to you for cheap, if your looking for quality, they will get it to you for the best price. All negative reviews need to understand how economics works and go to business school if they are going to slam this company. Shame on you!\n\nWe are customers for life and are thankful we have a place like this in Las Vegas. You will not be disappointed with their service."
2,"Everything about this place seems very upscale. And we did not have any issues there. We actually really had a good time, interacting with the one-man-band. But nothing about the food justifies their prices. Considering the upscale setting, we expected much more. The food and service were goode. I guess we just expected it to be exceptional and therefore were a bit disappointed."
2,Less Douchy Than Expected.\n\nI went last night with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised at the mix at Martini Ranch. I actually met some really nice people to hang out with (there were a lot of bachelorette parties there) and spent the evening in the club room upstairs with the go-go poles in it (note about the poles - they're on a platform and short so it's hard to do some of the pole tricks on them). \n\nThe DJ had some great dance music playing and everyone was dancing and having a great time without the pretentiousness you might find in other Scottsdale clubs.MR is good for a girls night out or a place to hang out with a group of friends.\n\nBeer's were cheap - $3.50 for a bottle there was plenty of space on the patio so you don't have to be pushed against some creepy guy the whole evening.
3,Sadly in this part of own there are not too many steakhouses and over time even restaurants have been going under.  This Outback's food has been consistently good and the service is always on point.
0,"Place is a joke. Screwed up drive-thru order, food is disgusting, hard, dry. Wont answer phone. Calling MasterCard to do a chargeback."
0,If you like this sort of thing go for it but anyone with kids who know the difference between kosher hotdogs and crap should avoid the children's menu hot dog! SO disappointed at the lack of quality! Two bites and it went right into the trash. But the onion soup was edible.
1,"This cafe is where you will find every Vegas cab driver eating breakfast. Next time I want steak and eggs I will make sure not to ask a taxi driver lol Walked in with my 2 female friends around 7 am ( after dancing all night) and immediately we realized we were the only ladies in there surrounded by tables filled with cab men. It was quite an interesting dining experience. It was taxi cab confessions, all the men were discussing crazy cab stories so we just sat back and silently chuckled. \n\nThe steak and eggs for $5.99 was worth the price...nothing to rave about. The waitress was friendly and you can tell she deals with these cab guys on a daily. The silver wear was DIRTY...like pretty nasty looking. I felt very awkward sitting in that cafe at that time, we were pretty much starred at our entire meal...as if we didn't belong. I'm going to let the locals keep this place as their gem and I'll continue my search for steak and eggs elsewhere."
3,Open air concept adjacent to construction at Red Rock casino! Fun lunch! Attentive staff very well versed on menu and ingredients. Stiegl from Austria is a must enjoy again beverage but I'll pass on ordering ice tea here again let's just say it's a tad reminiscent of cough syrup... Order Stiegl instead!!!  Tacos are small in scale but the ingredients are KICK ASS no doubt about it!  Mahi Ceviche..... PERFECT!!! To go order included a coupon!
0,"Went on Christmas Eve...party of 6.  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  Our main course (BBQ) was cold...when we asked to have them heat it up we waited 30 minutes for it to return by that time, the side dishes were cold.  We were promised that we would be refunded for the cost of the meat and for desert.  We got neither. and ended up paying an unfair amount considering our food was cold, late, and bland.  Then the manager printed up 5 receipts as an attempt to fool us.   The whole ordeal lasted almost 2 hours AFTER our meal was done.  WE felt victimized and the customer service was HORRIBLE!!!  We filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  STAY AWAY!!!  At least from the one in RED ROCK CASINO!!!"
1,"Quite disappointing for an 'upscale' restaurant.  Entree price range is around 25-50 dollar range.  Being that the meals are pricey, you expect the service and atmosphere to justify that.  They charge $3 for valet, and they don't have the front staff open the door when you arrive.  They didn't know where to seat us and left us standing in the middle of the dining room while they went back to the front desk to figure it out. Not something you'd really get ticked about at a Claim Jumper but if you're going to bill yourself as upscale, get your service right. Our waiter screwed up my order and tried to blame me for his lack of knowing his menu.  I ordered seared ahi tuna (exactly what it says on the menu) and he brought out the ahi tuna a la diablito.  He tried to say that the tuna is seared.. and then said \""I'll see what the chef can do.\""  Hopefully the chef taught him how to listen, get orders correct, and to think before opening his mouth.\n\nFood around the table,\n-  Wedge salad - Good but obviously not a complicated thing to prepare.\n-  Seared ahi tuna - It was bland, overcooked (how you overcook a sear is puzzling).  Not high quality and poor presentation.  \n-  Surf & Turf - Lobster was good.  However, go to your local grocer, pick up a cheap cut of meat, marinade it... save 52 dollars.  I probably could have scored a better steak at an IHOP.  As an upscale restaurant, I'm surprised they aren't a little embarrassed to serve such a low quality piece of meat.  It was also under seasoned.\n-  Ahi tuna a la diablito - High quality sushi that was pretty good.  Small portion though, and the orzo wasn't that good.  \n-  Had a couple of desserts and they were both good.\n\nI'm not normally a picky person when it comes to service, but when you're paying 30-50 for a plate of food, I expect the restaurant to get the service right, and make it an experience for the guest.  There really isn't one thing on the menu that makes you say, \""I can only go to Skye for that\"".  \n\nSurprisingly their drinks are pretty affordable.  Overall, stick to Scottsdale if you want a true 'upscale' experience.  In the world of upscale restaurants, this is the weird cousin that nobody talks to."
0,"1 week after being charged the $25 no refund.  We called back today and a \""manager\"" will need to call us back.  If that manager doesn't call back today and handle it then we'll have to file a fraudulent charge with our bank against the bar."
3,"What a wonderful surprise we stumbled upon. We stopped on a whim before the Garth Brooks show, not realizing what an awesome place this is. We were seated on the patio overlooking the lake and the wall of water. Immediately a team of servers went to work lighting our candle, removing extra place settings and assisting my wife with her napkin. We literally had five different people offering us outstanding service during the course of our meal. \n\nFor example, we order the meatballs and when they arrived, they were brought out by a manager who introduced himself, told us a bit about the meatballs, dished them onto our plates and then waited for our approval before excusing himself. We were treated to such remarkable service the entire evening. \n\nObviously we knew nothing about this place beforehand as we didn't even know about the impressive interactive shows that take place on the lake every half hour. The musical light shows were quite cool and left us entertained and impressed by the technological feats. \n\nGreat drinks. Wonderful meal. Outstanding service. Awesome atmosphere. A bit pricey, which is why I docked it a star, but of course the prices are on par for the Wynn."
0,Overrated!  Get over yourself laundry room.  All this texting is super annoying.  They were very inflexible with my group. They bumped our reservation claiming that another group arrived in our place.  We finally got in only to see an empty bar...literally only two people. Clearly that was a lie.  This place is no different than the fake lines at the strip trying to pretend they are more popular than they are.  I wouldn't come back nor would I recommend this place.
3,"I like the music most of the time about 99 percent of the time. It does as it advertises, makes me want to move.\n\nWhat I do not like is the banter of the radio folk, usually inane nonsense. Cut down on the talk and play more music. I mean I can get downtown from my home in the far west valley and never hear a tune. Yuck. I love to dance while I am driving, give some music, please."
2,"Ever see that movie \""Zombieland\""? Or \""The Road Warrior\""? It's kinda like that. Oh, remember that song \""The freaks come out at night?\"" That's not the case here. It's pretty trippy. There's a whole crowd of goths, punk rockers and... movie characters like Spiderman walking around. You can definately tell that you're not on the strip anymore. I even spotted a mini-Mr. T standing around. There are more artists and knick-knack pagodas spread out as well. It's cool to see the people overhead zip-lining across the length of the experience. And then of course there's the hot and trashy women dancing on the outside bars and on the gaming tables inside the casinos. Not so cool is the one stage where apparently anyone can go up and pretend they are Wayne Newton and sing karaoke style all day long. I guess there's a reason why it's called the Freemont Street \""Experience\"". \n\nBecause it certainly is."
3,"I love the huge beer selection, cheap yet delicious food. It's great! \n\nMy favorites are the beef stew, the daily mussels special!\n\nHowever.. I must say the wait is LONGGGGGGGG for food, so don't ever come here on an empty stomach! And, it is definitely not a place for chatting, you get deaf after a while from the shouting!"
4,"Thank you fellow Yelpers!  I trusted you, and you didn't let me down.  \n\nMy regular \""nail gal\"" that I had gone to for over two years left for CA...and I have been trying and trying to find another place.  Well, I've found it.  I needed a new set, got an appointment with Jackie, and am SO happy with the results!  I have gotten so many compliments on my nails.  JT Nails - you are awesome!"
3,This place has been here forever and every few years I like to come in for dessert. I had the James Dean Sundae. Very good creamy ice cream and tasty Caramel. The waitress was pleasant and friendly enough. Didn't try any food as this really is a place for ice cream desserts with the feel of an old fashioned parlor. Beats Dairy Queen hands down for a few more $$$ and more relaxing than any of the chains like Cold Stone Creamery or B&R.
4,"What a delight!\n\nMy husband and I were in my hometown for Christmas, and ventured out on our third date since the birth of our son.  I was so excited to check out Lawrenceville for the first time, and couldn't wait to show my foodie husband that Pittsburgh can do sophisticated with the best of them.  Before dinner, we stopped at Espresso A Mano because I heard it was the best coffee shop in Pittsburgh.\n\nI was so surprised when we stepped up to the counter and the barista greeted me by my maiden name!  Thirteen years after we were on the high school track team together, Matt recognized me.  Man, he is good with names!  It was fun to catch up, and I'm so proud to see a fellow McKeesport alum being such a success.  \n\nMy decaf, almond milk latte (for my nursing son's benefit) was surprisingly rich in coffee flavor, and was served up without a hint of pretension.  I remember singing along to the music, and loved the exposed brick walls.\n\nGood people.  Good coffee."
1,"Not much meat selection,  really slow,  even though,I wasn't crowded.  The meat was really some poor cuts. Ie sirloin.   The salad bar was boring. I have to say I came Here about a year ago and was really impressed."
1,This is a decent hotel.  Decent for a quick over-nighter if you've missed a flight.  But it's not good for longer stays or repeat visits.  The building itself needs updating.  The food at breakfast is OK. But lunch/dinner is like bar food.  Half of the floors don't have vending machines.  One of the floors that does does not offer drinks.  One machine that offered drinks keeps your money without providing a drink.  The other working machine is all out of stock.  Bottled water in the room is $4.00 (before they tack on other BS charges).  Internet access is $9.95 per day.  3G reception in the building is horrible too!  It's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable.\n\nI'd recommend staying somewhere else if you can!

4,"It's trendy, I'm not. It's hip, I once might have been. It's modern, I usually hate modern. But I LOVE the W. I'd probably usually say it's too loud, too dark, too pretentious, and the lobby/bar may be all of that. But the rooms are sublime. We stayed in a king room on the 8th floor, 814 to be exact. It was huge, and the bathroom is probably equal size as the bedroom with an open concept that makes the entire room seem like a massive studio. Furniture is plush and chic. Sitting chair as comfortable as they come as well as a very cozy bed. W has their own brand of mattresses. Bathroom included a walk in shower with rain fall shower head and room for the Montreal Canadiens starting five. Also includes a deep, long bath tub. The room is loaded with extras! Ipod dock with surround sound speakers, kaleidoscope, rubber ducky, beyond well equipped mini bar which even has souvenirs, tv bigger than most hotels. Location is close to everything in the old quarter. Subway stop directly across the street. The view looked over Victoria square but no noise could be heard from the busy area. The room is loaded with extras! Staff are the best at what they do. From the housekeepers to valets to concierge. I would say its probably not a good hotel for families or the elderly, but to say I enjoyed my stay would be an understatement."
3,"We love this place. Been back a 3-4 times now and the only reason it is not a five star is due to the spotty service. I'll get to that in a second. \n\nThe food: We almost always start with a set of rolls and we've yet to be disappointed. Also the fire cracker shrimp and calamari are tops. We then either get and entree and salad to split family style or split a sandwich and salad. Either way, you can't go wrong. Their grilled pork is very good and goes well on the sandwich and/or salad. \n\nDrinks: Plenty on tap and the bar tender will make just about anything you toss at him. They have Camelback Brewery's IPA which is one of the best local beers. With $2.50 pints during happy hour, you will not be disappointed. \n\nService: This is why Rice Paper doesn't get 5 stars, yet. They have lots of people working in the small house but the waitstaff we've had has almost consistently disappointed. This last time we had our rolls on the table while our drinks languished at the bar. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed. This was our experience with a different server on another night. The bus staff outnumber the wait staff and they are always trying to take plates away, which can get annoying when eating family style. \n\nTo summarize, definitely try Rice Paper and support this great new local business. If they could just get their service delivery down we would probably go back even more."
0,"Why do people go here and spend money? This place is overpriced and the food is awful. Plain awful. On my visit, there was 2 people other than our party in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes to be seated and about 25 minutes to receive our food.  It was absurd.  The food came out lukewarm, at best. The food was bland and super salty and just...gross. I wouldn't ever go here again. just awful."
3,"After driving by this place for almost a year. Daughter and I decided to try this place for breakfast after our Sunday morning hike! Daughter had her favorite! The Country skillet with no gravy, she enjoyed it very much, She's not much on home fries, she loves hash browns. But since they did not offer that. She actually enjoyed the home fries! Sausages were different but very good. I had their pancakes, I could only eat two out of the three. They were very thick, and very good. Glad we finally tried it, and we will definitely come back!"
0,"Wow, was the manager of this restaurant incredibly rude! We had a guest in our party with food allergies and while simply inquiring how their fair was prepared we were greeted with hostility and frustration, seemingly wasting his time.\n\nWe had zero expectation of accommodation, only inquiring how their food was prepared. You would think we asked them to give us their top secret recipes for, of all things, a burger joint for crying out loud.\n\nWhile the manager was startlingly rude, the hostess was pleasant and was at least sensitive to our plight.\n\nI'm not sure I'd give this place another chance, but if you have possible food issues, I'd go ahead and skip this one. They're not likely to care."
2,"Horribly overpriced, but on Mondays the specials are a good buy and a delight of variety.  I won't come any other day of the week, but on Monday this place is a go-to-spot for sushi.  Good service but occasionally a little slow."
1,"This place used to be great, but it's sad to see what it has turned into. One of their selling points was a variety of classes that were available from 5 am to 11 pm. Now they have very limited classes that are jammed packed with signs stating that's tips are mandatory. Very low class! They no longer offer shampoo or conditioner in the locker rooms and have no place to hang a towel while in the shower. The staff is very unorganized when it comes to class cards and often forget to pass them out. I recently renewed my membership after taking a few months off and needless to say....had I taken a few classes before renewing, I wouldn't have renewed. The only reason I keep coming back is because the instructors are awesome."
4,"Use to stop by for the cheaper gas, fell in love with soda fountain!"
4,Surprisingly good pizza!
1,"We were hoping for a nice dinner worthy if the prices but was sorely disappointed.  The waiter was ok, but I expect more from a high priced restaurant.  My dish (Raviolini) was pretty good, but my husbands tasted like I could have thrown it together for my kids.  Overall, big let down."
1,"Food were nice but way too expensive. We waited too long between orders (waiters said too many orders and they all messed up). The waiter set us in an awful spot (in a grim corner). Last order around 9:30 PM or earlier, be prepared for that."
1,"The decor is not that creative - ok buddha's everywhere, bathtubs w/ rose petals and girls in lingerie laying around. Boring !!\nOf course, it's super crowded. Why are there so many stories/levels ?? Just open up the dance floor so my feet don't get stepped on!"
2,Please hire more help in the evenings and keep black walnut in stock! That's all. Thank you.
3,"I'm a total out of shape, novice runner. That said, the couple of times I've been in run for your life, the guys have been exceedingly polite and helpful. A young fellow recommended unbelievably expensive socks, I thought he was full of it, but he was totally right! He recommended coming back to check my stride but was very understandable that shoes are expensive, no sales pressure. I really respect that. I plan to go here when it's time for a new pair of shoes."
0,"Emily was beyond rude and had no interest in helping me Purchase a phone. I walked into this store excited to purchase my first iPhone and set up with AT&T, but received nothing but a bad attitude by an employee who obviously doesn't like their job. The lack of customer service I received made me uneasy so I decided to leave and set up service elsewhere. I will not be returning to this location I would rather drive out of my way and be treated with respect than to be subject to the treatment I received here again."
1,"Not the quality education I was looking for.\nThe professors are disorganized and can NOT teach, especially lab.\nI end up khan academy or MIT open course-ware-ing most of my classes.\n\nIn particular, CHM 151LL and 152 LL Dr. Indu Mishra will take off points for no reason even for a perfect lab report.\nInconsistency in grading, students with less accurate data end up with higher grades on the lab reports.\nRun the other way while you can"
1,"First off, this rating was an average taken from my two visits to SuWu. \n\nVisit #1:\nI'm a sucker for rustic, hipster d\u00e9cor, so when I saw those wooden paneled walls, green filled space and the pendant light bulbs dangling, I told myself I would get my lazy butt there even through the midst of midterms. \n\nI dropped by with a friend on a Saturday evening at around 6pm expecting it to be pretty packed. However, it was surprisingly pretty empty and we got a first dibs on the seats. The waiter was attentive and patient so there wasn't an issue with the service. \n\nWhat I really had a problem with was how they didn't have half the things on the menu. I remember seeing some pretty interesting dishes and getting all pumped up to try them only to find out that none of them are available. I mean, why have a menu when you don't even have half the things? And keep in mind this is pretty early on into the night so I thought it was a bit weird that they're running out of things in the kitchen already. It got to a point where we simply asked the waiter what they do have and I ended up ordering a Philly steak sandwich and some rosemary fries. \n\nI'm usually not a meat person, but I have to say that was a meat sandwich that I would definitely eat again! The meat was succulent and I don't know what kind of witchcraft was going on in that sauce but it was divine...and I have to say, that steak sandwich was the only reason why I did decide to go back.\n\nVisit #2\nThe second time here was for a date. It was a Thursday evening and this place was jam packed and loud! I lost my voice by the end of the night trying to scream across the tiny table. Probably not the best first date experiences. \n\nThis time around they changed everything on the menu! Personally, I think this time around, the menu didn't look as appetizing as the previous one. Most of the food items was fried or some sort. I ended up getting their poutine and my date got corn dogs. \n\nI thought my poutine was overpowered with the green onions. Definitely not the best I've had. Apparently the corn dogs were so dry and bland that he couldn't even finish them. For his first corn dog experience, I would say it did not end well. \n\nConclusion:\nThey make a hell of a great Philly steak sandwich that would forever have a special place in my heart until I eat a better one. I would go back to simply enjoy d\u00e9cor and romantic ambience. But food wise, due to their inconsistency, I'll probably pass."
0,We rolled up on Tuesday before 8 pm and it was closed!  WTH!  I was starving and now I can't try you BBQ!
3,"Wish it had a drive thru, but otherwise a nice location. Inside there is a lot of room and plenty of tables to sit and hang out. There are power outlets if you look, so you can also charge the computer, etc., while having coffee."
2,"Been here twice so far.\n\nFirst visit:\nCame here for dinner and ordered the duck curry on a yelper's recommendation. Absolutely love the duck curry. To quote another yelper, \""The crispy duck curry is a savory thai curry shimmered with the sweet pineapple and grapes, sometimes with lycee to balance out the spiciness, while the duck are fried super crispy.\"" This is one dish that I tried on that yelper's recommendation and it was superb. LOVE IT! Just be careful with regards to the spice level. If you can't take spicy, go mild. I think I had mine at level 6 or 7 and it was somewhat burning my mouth. And I generally have my food spicy. So you've been warned.\n\nPs. The duck curry is not on their menu. You have to ask for this dish specifically. Remember to check with the staff on the price. I remember I was a little shocked when I saw the bill.\n\nSecond visit:\nDecide to come here and try out their lunch specials. Ordered the beef noodle soup (pho) and omg, bad decision. As we know, the broth is the backbone of any kind of noodle soup and my beef noodle soup was literally drowned in salt. I could feel the sodium kicking into my system and it did not go well with me at all. Other than the sodium laden broth, I honestly cannot remember anything else about my dish. My friends who ordered other dishes (I can't recall what their orders were now) were also complaining about their food, although i can't quite remember what their complaints were. Overall, none of us enjoyed our lunch experience that afternoon. \n\nService was good, and that's probably why I gave this place a 3-star. After my second visit, I think I am just going to have to stick to only my duck curry from now on. That is how traumatized I've become after having that beef noodle soup."
3,"We went here for dinner.  \nStarted off with garlic rolls were good.  Virgin Olive Oil and Balsamic vinegar were provided on the table for dipping.  The Balsamic vinegar was sweeter and not as acrid as the one from DOCG.  I accompanied my meal with a Moretti, an Italian beer and really liking this over Peroni.  There is less of an aftertaste and more pleasing to my palate.\n\nOrdered the Linguine Carbonara.  I wanted to taste it so I have a reference of how it should taste.  Most comments online say why order it when you can just make it at home.  They are correct.   Most restaurants serve carbonara but they often add heavy cream and a whole bunch of other items.  Trattoria Reggiano was the only one I found that serves it how it is should to be, Pancetta, Cheese, Egg, and Pasta, that's it.  Overall, the taste was close to how I make it so I'm glad I'm in the general vicinity.  The criticism I have though is that they a used a little too much pancetta and the sauce could have been a little looser.  Additionally, there was little or no black pepper.  Should have asked for freshly cracked black pepper but instead used black pepper on the table, which didn't add much.\n\nMy friend had the Chicken Marsala.  It was very good.  The dish overall was not greasy.  The sauce had a lot of flavor.  Unlike a lot of Chicken Marsala we get in Hawaii where they use too much butter/oil where it masks the Marsala and chicken flavors.\n\nRegarding they other parts of the meal, service was ok.  It lacked in the beginning but picked up later on.  Didn't really care to eat outside in the mall as the tables were too close to each other.\n\nI would highly recommend this place if you are looking for simply Italian food."
2,"Well my first time at the gun range,and I must admit...it was FUN! So here goes my Pros/Cons\n\nPros:\n1. Knowledgeable Staff\n2. Plenty of fire power\nsadly that's where it ends\n\nCons:\n1.BUSY-that's good thing for them, but you will have a wait! Especially on weekend\n2.Small-there were people sitting on the floor, standing in corners. Literally shoulder to shoulder\n3.Flustered Range officers-they are not unfriendly, just a lil overwhelmed by the amount of people and trying to keep up with everything going on. I guess I would be too if  30 people carrying rifles and pistols came walking through the door all at once\n4. Price-seemed expensive to me. I shared a lane & gun plus ammo with my two sisters for 30 minutes and it came to $88!  All I remember hearing was $15 per gun\n\nNot a bad place to visit if  you've ever wanted to go to a range, just keep in mind the small size and the long lines.."
3,"So close to getting a 5* recommendation from me.  Finally tried Vegas's newest gourmet dining buffet, and I definitely loved it.  The dishes were amazing, but for some reason I still like Wicked Spoon better.\n\nThat being said, I did have an amazing customer service experience.  I tried a piece of a square pizza that turned out to be amazing.  Went to get more at the end of my meal, and was told it was the chef's specialty.  I chatted with him and he said he'd make me a \""personal pizza.\""  15 minutes later I came back to a HUGE pizza just for me.  It was blue cheese, prosciutto, and another meet I'm forgetting.  Go to the Italian station and ask for \""Tony Gets\"" and have him make you this masterpiece!"
1,"I have gotten cupcakes from here since we moved to town in 2011.  I love their variety and the fact that they don't put 4 inches of frosting on top.  We also try and support local businesses as much as possible.  \n\nI have always picked up my cupcakes in store and decided to try delivery for a business meeting for work.  We had our executive team in Madison from Chicago and they were really looking forward to having a Chocolate Bacon Maple Whiskey cupcake.  I placed the order online and called to follow up and pay with a credit card over the phone and to make sure they could be delivered between 9:30 and 10:30 a.m. like I specified on the online delivery form.  They said that it was no problem!\n\n  By 1:00 (at the conclusion of our meeting that started at 11, hence the delivery time notice) there will still no sign of cupcakes.  I called and they said that the were very busy today (which I understand, it being so close to Valentine's Day) and that they should be there within the next 5-10 minutes.  Just before 3:00 they were finally delivered, almost 5 hours after they said we would have them.  While we were very excited that they had come and we could enjoy them, we were very disappointed that the sole purpose of us ordering them (for our meeting with the executive team from Chicago) for our event today had passed and the executive team had left to head back to Chicago.  \n\nI find it upsetting that a place that delivers for a variety of holidays and events cannot deliver on time, or even close to on time - regardless if it's a holiday or not.  I can't imagine if it was a birthday party or something really special and they show up 5 hours late after everyone has left.  \n\nWe will continue to buy cupcakes from Cupcakes A Go Go in store, but I will never order delivery from them.  Unfortunately this event has left everyone in our office feeling the same way - unreliable delivery service.  \n\nVery disappointed with our experience today, but at least the cupcakes were still good."
1,The worst fries I've ever had! The best pulled pork Reuben. The banana cream pie needs bananas in it or else it is just a cream pie. The crust was non existent! Overall disappointed dining experience!
3,"How did I miss reviewing The Hotel after our Vegas trip?\n\nThe reasons many people book The  Hotel (the rooftop bar, the connection to Mandalay Bay with its beach and many pools), was not really our reason.  We just wanted a nice hotel, at a good price.  The Hotel surely delivered.\n\nFirst of all, the room was huge.  We had a sitting area, with a TV, huge bedroom with many closets, another TV, and bathroom about the size of the bedroom, also with a TV, separate stalls, and double sinks.  I think the entire suite was larger than a typical Boston or NYC apartment.   If Vegas did not have so many slot machines, we really could have spent a lot of time in the room.  And, it was very clean.  And I love all their spa products.  Mini bar was expensive, and be careful to not use it for your own drinks, they charge you if you do!  We had a misunderstanding about this.. but thankfully a quick phone call and they reversed the charge.\n\nThe location is at the top of the strip- so it can be a hike to the other casinos.  But, there are plenty of walkways through each of the casinos, and lots of slot machines, to make the journey fun.  The Hotel is directly connected to Mandalay Bay, which has a ton of restaurants, shops, and again, more slot machines.  Definitely stop at House of Blues - great happy hour, and fun atmosphere.\n\nThe Hotel is also close the airport, so I think also makes for a cheaper cab ride compared to some of the hotels.  Will definitely be on my 'return to' list."
4,"Open a studio here on Kaua'i already! Rebecca and Matthew couldn't have created a more perfect space for getting your vinyasa on. Sutra offers a variety of classes for all different levels (and music tastes:) My favorites were the Vinyasa, Power, and Candlelight flows--I was so hooked that I made my way over around five times a week (even through the last week of my pregnancy)!\n\nThe Sutra Mum classes were equally as amazing and I would recommend them to any prenatal or postnatal yogini. I truly believe that they made a positive impact on my pregnancy, birthing experience, and transition to motherhood. I miss this place like crazy and can't wait to pop in for a class (or two, or three...) the next time I visit Phoenix!"
3,"In great anticipation, we made our way from our hotel to the restaurant.  We were there at 5:45 and had no problems being seated right away. \n\nWe had the #14 nam kao tod meat salad, garlic prawns, tom kha gai soup and crispy duck on drunken noodles.  It was a lot of food, enough for a doggie bag for later too.  \nTo drink, Thai ice tea (creamy almost like an iced coffee) and a Thai Lime drink  (refreshing but too sweet, ask for less sugar). \n\nTotal came to around $75.00 for the two of us.  \n\nNow, I may be crucified for this but, it wasn't knock my socks off amazing.  It was delicious, but I've been spoiled with Thai food here in Toronto.  We go to Express Thai on Dufferin which is owned and operated by a Thai family, and I feel the flavours there are just as fresh and authentic as Lotus of Siam.  We ordered all the things that were rec'd to us, but next time I'll have to be a bit more adventurous with our choices to really experience the magic of this place."
3,"Great food, decent prices.  We got 2 breakfast plates and a coffee $13.99.  2 pancakes 2 eggs, potatoes,  2 sausage & 2 biscuits and gravy,  2eggs, bacon, potatoes.   We were seated within 5 minutes.   Service was nice and sufficiently fast.  They even made drinks to go.  Very awesome."
1,"I've gone here about once or twice a year for about 7 years.  The girls are great, but I was just there last weekend and while I was fine with $100 for a private dance, I was shocked by the $46 price tag for two drinks.  I might show up again in the future if I'm dragged there, but I'm definitely never getting a private ever again."
1,"Had the cold pig ears, pork noodle dish, and pan fried dumplings.  Meh, it was okay but not worth going back."
2,The pool looks nicer than it used to. Music still sucks.
1,"I hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of BOA's lunch.  I was so looking forward to a great lunch experience, since it is a very popular restaurant among the stars.  Unfortunately the food was dry, bland, and boring, much like this review.  Will I eat here again?--maybe.  I'll give dinner a try and update this review in about six months."
2,"I had a hankering for some wings last night and didn't want to drive too far from home, so the hubby and I stopped by Hooters. We went there once when they first opened and didn't go again because it was a bad experience all around. We figured to give them another try because we figured they would have fixed all the kinks by now... and they did :)\n\nWe sat ourselves and didn't have to wait long until the waitress showed up and took our drink order. She was smiley and very pretty that even I crushed on her a little bit! \n\nWe ordered the fried pickles to start and 20 piece chicken wings. Everything came out in good time. The fried pickles are definitely addicting! The wings were cooked and flavored just as I like 'em.\n\nAll in all, it was a pleasant experience. I would go back again for sure!"
0,"Ordered a grilled steak burrito for delivery and when I got it there was no steak.  The delivery service (Eats24) contacted the restaurant and said for sure there was steak in the burrito... so I guess the customer who's eating it is wrong!  What a joke, food was at best average otherwise.  Won't recommend this place to anyone."
2,"Pretty cool place.  A little hard to find, not a sign that is easily visible from the street or at least not that I saw.  But cool place upstairs.  very nice people that worked there and served us.  I had two beers, the honey and a strawberry.  I liked the honey a lot. Was very crisp.  For the burger I ended up ordering the Holsom burger sorry i forgot what the name of it was and no menu online. They need a website.  Well the burger had bacon, candied jalapenos, some crack sauce, pepper jack (i got it with cheddar), lettuce tomato and grilled onions all on a pretzel bun.  Needs the stiff bun or it would disintegrate a regular one.  Very good burger, not the best i have had, especially for the price.  Why the i gave 3 star rating.  Maybe give it 3.5.  Good, but not great.  I'd come back.."
0,"Food was ok, THE SERVICE and waiter were HORRIBLE.  We waited over 20 mins for our drinks as he cleaned nearby tables that guests vacated (that was more important)\n\nHe showed his attitude and was rude.  VIG doesn't care about their customers anymore as they are so busy.  No one from management even walks the floor in the front of the house to asks guests about their experience.  The VIG got too big too quick and forgot about good customer service.  Get rid of the staff with attitude!!!\n\nWont even try the Vig uptown.  Wont waste my time."
3,"We came in here for dinner and really enjoyed it. I've ordered masala's at other places and they haven't made them as spicy as I like them to be, but here I ordered spicy chicken masala and I received a flavorful hot, SPICY chicken masala. Staff was very friendly and attentive.\nP.S.\nI Love Indian Food! ;-)"
2,"Ohhhhh, the Three Palms Resort.  How, oh how, our relationship is so bittersweet.\n\nThe first time I stayed in this hotel was for my friend's bachelorette party in April of this year.  We decided to get the 2 queen suite because it was cheap and provided ample room for all the ladies to stay in.  When we got there and checked in, we couldn't find parking anywhere.  We had to park far away from our room.  Whatever.  \n\nRoom:  The room was awesome!!!  We had almost a mini-kitchen in our suite and a fridge that held PLENTY of liquor!!!  The fridge is about 4 feet tall.  The decor is modern, yet extremely retro, with hues of poop brown, burnt orange, puke green...you get the point, but I LOVED it!  The bedding is VERY comfortable.  There were 2 bathrooms in our suite, 2 tv's, all the works.  We had a room facing the pool, which was nice.\n\nLocation:  The location for this hotel is amazing.  You are centrally located to many nearby attractions in Old Town Scottsdale and cab rides are cheap as hell to anywhere around that area.  Try the divey sports bar across the park...can't remember the name of it, but drinks are CHEAP.\n\nStaff: This is where my rating goes bad.  The first time we got this room we had a male dancer come for my friend.  He arrived in his fire fighter gear (people must have saw him when he was by our room in front of the pool with his boom-box).  With a bundle of ladies, and only around 9 pm, our man went to work.  15 minutes in to serving his customers (us) we got a knock on the door.  It was security telling us we were being TOO LOUD and that we needed to turn it down.  WHATEV.  So, the man kept at it, and another 10 minutes later we had another knock at the door.  This time, we were being too loud AND apparently we didn't have the blinds closed all the way and people at the pool could see the action.  So, we closed the blinds, turned down the music, and went back at it.  The THIRD time we had a COP at our door.  WTH?!  It was not even 10 pm yet and we were already about to get the boot from this place.\n\nIT DOES NOT STOP HERE!\n\nThe second time I stayed in this place, I once again got a suite.  This one had a jacuzzi in it.  My friends and I got back to our room at about 1 am, and not even 3 minutes after we got in we had a knock at the door.  Low and behold it was security telling us we were being TOO LOUD!  I said we JUST got in to the room.  He then tried to accuse us of parking in front of the fire pole and told us to move, except it was not our vehicle!\n\nAfter the second time of getting interupted, I decided to write a review on their website about my experience.  Needless to say I have not heard back about my stays.  I am a paying customer and pay to stay in a hotel to go have fun, drink, and party, especially when I stay in a suite.\n\nBe forewarned on your experience.  I will go back because the location is good, the price is cheap, and the room itself is awesome, but the security and hotel staff suck."
0,"Went here for dinner to celebrate a birthday and although the food was pretty good I have never had worse service at a restaurant in my life. The server/managers were very rude, condescending, and unprofessional. We were treated like we were a nuisance and as if our business did not matter to them. Even though the food was good I will not be returning back here due to the way we were treated. Very disappointed with the attitude the wait staff and management had."
0,"not a phillies or eagles bar as they claim to be. asked the bartender/owner how the phillies were doing and can you get them on tv. her response was\""i don't care about that\"". that means she doesn't care about my business. keep your ghetto cliente and keep watching your cooking shows."
1,"Went here for a birthday dinner during a girls only weekend in Vegas. What a perfect place to go to with a bunch of girls surrounded by cute servers and bus boys! \n\nThe menu is in Italian with English descriptions of the meals. You really have to take your time to read it (unless of course you can read and understand Italian). The portion sizes are large enough for sharing which is perfect for keeping a high cost meal on the cheaper side.\n\nThe whole experience and food was great but if I'm back in Vegas, and craving Italian, I'll explore my options a lot more."
1,"If you are calling to make reservations and 3 restaurants turn you down, and the 4th restaurant says it can seat you at 7:30 on a Friday night, just order a pizza instead.\n\nWent here to celebrate my boyfriend and his little brother's birthday. Started out lovely: piano and trumpet at the bar, a violet prosecco cocktail which was tingly and tangy, and very promising menu selections.\n\nThe lil bro and lil sis ordered a house specialty with rigatoni. When it arrived, the both said it was a little undercooked. When we cracked a rigaton in half there was the white circle inside. From what I've always been taught and the internet has confirmed that means it's ALMOST done, but not quite. 1 more minute! The next time the waiter came by we pulled him aside quietly to give him and the kitchen a head's up that the pasta wasn't quite done. He offered to cook up their dishes a little longer to get them a bit more palatable. Fine, sounds great. Everyone happy.\n\nWhen the waiter returned he proclaims, \""The chef wanted you to know that if you ever go to Italy ask for your pasta overcooked.\""\n\nI thought it was really uncalled for and soured the rest of the evening. \n\nAlso someone ordered the asparagus risotto. It was Uncle Ben's white rice with chicken broth poured over it and 3 asparagus stalks. \n\nWhen I go to Italy again I will order all the correctly cooked pasta and risotto to realize what I missed on this night. \n\nSecond star is for the cocktail and sweet hostess whom I hope finds another job soon."
0,"NO SERVICE, Waited over an hour, ask for assistance several times, walked out and two other tables next to us also followed us out .."
1,"Was very disappointed with the food, the hamburger was small and not so hot.  Cooked well but not flavorful, the fries were cold and soggy,  The only redeeming quality about the meal was the service was friendly and attentive, A little expensive for a hamburger,"
0,"There was basically no cheese on my \""cheese combo sandwich\"", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us."
1,Not as good as I expected. I ordered the fried oyster to start and was completely displeased. The service was not that great as well. Not returning anytime soon
3,Good nice grocery  store with regular and organic food items. I enjoy getting the basics like milk yogurt fresh fruits when in season and some other items that may look good that I may wanna try. Always good to try.
4,You can never go wrong with watching KA.  The stage is a true masterpiece since it moves.  The best seats are in the back section or else your neck might hurt from looking up if your in the front section.  Spectacular show.  A must see!
4,"This is my new favorite place to hang-out and be productive in town.  I like everything about this place.  The neighborhood in which it is located is so cozy.  The actual coffee shop itself is quite nice as well, and quiet!  This is huge for me.  The service is friendly.  The food is fantastic.  The hot-chocolate is the best I've had since I've moved here.  Free wi-fi, and nice spacious windows to look out to the street when you're looking for a little break/distraction from your work.  What more could you really ask for?  And like others, I am a bit hesitant to hype this place since it is so awesome."
4,"To describe this briefly, it's like what you'd get if Viva Las Arepas actually tasted good.\n\nI was excited to try Rika Arepa Express when Amanda M. told me how good they were, and I my eyes grew wide when I heard that they'd be at Bad Beat Brewing in Henderson, which is just minutes from my place. They were supposed to be there at 5:30pm, and I arrived around 5:40, but the food truck took until 6:00 to arrive and spent perhaps 20 more minutes to set up their spot in front of Bad Beat and to get their stoves fired up and what not.\n\nMy wait was rewarded the moment I bit into my #1 Pabellon. The sweet plantains hit first with their warmth, their soft yet not mushy texture, and of course their sweetness. They made me regret not getting the combo, which comes with lots of sweet plantains. The shredded beef came next and delighted my taste buds with savory flavor. The black beans actually tasted good too, and the melted mozzarella was great. Encompassing all of its fillings, the arepa itself was a cornmeal flatbread with a crisp, browned exterior and a soft interior, and it easily stayed intact until the end. I love corn, by the way. The arepa and the foil wrapping turned out to be so hot that I'm pretty sure my fingers received first-degree burns, and my mouth didn't care one bit.\n\nSince I decided to sit truck-side, they offered me squeeze bottles of green creamy cilantro and  spicy (read: medium-ish) smoky red sauce. The pabellon arepa was possibly good enough without these sauces, but just a squeeze or two of each (or both at once) every couple of bites really enhances the flavor profile.\n\nOne arepa is huge enough (and, at $7 post-tax, is a good value), but I also ordered the #2 La Sure\u00f1a with grilled chicken, smoked sausage, and avocado. It was almost as good as my Pabellon. The juicy flavor of the marinated/herbed chicken, the sweetness of the sausage, and the creaminess of the avocado all blended harmoniously with the hot and structurally sound arepa (serious props, this was over half an hour into the meal) to please my taste buds just minutes after I'd already enjoyed a masterpiece. I'd recommend trying both, although maybe you could consider sharing them with a friend (bring a knife or something).\n\nI also had the parchita, or passion fruit juice ($2). It's pretty much the same thing the Peruvian maracuya or any other juice made from real passion fruit that's had the seeds strained. It's sweet and has its own unique, almost incomparable flavor. It tastes like passion fruit. Yeah, that's the best description I can give, sue me. I enjoyed the parchita so thoroughly while waiting for my arepas and during the meal that I had to get a refill to-go ($1, in the original cup). The refill - most of it, anyway - is sitting in my fridge now and waiting for my taste buds to give in.\n\nAmanda M. and my other fellow Yelpers have it right. These guys are absolutely amazing. I think they're easily a contender for best food truck in Vegas, and they easily top Viva Las Arepas in the not-very-saturated arepas category. Make it a mission to find these guys at least once and I have no doubt that you'll be happy with your food."
2,"This is a tough event to review.  If I could give half stars, I would go with 2.5.\n\nI had never been to a performance of the Singing Christmas tree before, so I was looking forward to checking it out. As Chad mentioned in his review, the show was an odd mixture that included traditional Christmas songs, international Christmas songs, puppets, and dancers. \n\nThe singers making up the tree did sound pretty good for most of the songs they performed and the soloist had a nice voice.  However, there were a few songs that did not get very good treatment. For example, I felt that their performance of Feliz Navidad was watered down and washed out.  It was a disappointment.  Overall though, I would rate the singers a solid 3 stars. \n\nThe dancing was hit or miss. I enjoyed the Irish dancers, but some of the other dances were not my cup of tea. A couple of times, I felt the dances seemed a bit out of place for this type of performance - the rockette style dancing by younger performers seemed a bit odd to me. I would give this portion of the show 2 stars.\n\nI like the Grey Seal Puppets but honestly, the storyline of the polar bear puppet was a bit on the silly side.   The talents of the Grey Seal Puppeteers are much more apparent in their other performances. \n\nHowever, the biggest problems I noticed were with the venue itself. I would give the venue 1 star.   First off, when we arrived, there were a lot of seats that had been double-booked.  I have never seen that type of chaos at any type of performance I have been to. It was bizarre.\n\nThe acoustics in this venue have always been bad, and they still are. \n\nThen, the seats were actually uncomfortable and I felt squished into my seat sitting between one big person and one tall person.  I almost felt claustrophobic at times. \n\nTo top it all off, it was really hot in there.... so uncomfortable that we thought about leaving halfway through the show.   We did end up staying for the entire performance but I have to admit, I felt a sense of relief when the show was over."
0,"If I could give it zero stars I would. Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant in my entire 29 years of life. I was with a large group of 10 people and we ordered some beers and food (coming to an \""oyster house\"" and being told they don't recommend them on the half shell) and when we got our food the waiter got our order completely wrong and when we told her what happened instead of apologizing and offering to make it right she proceeded to tell us that was what we had ordered and that we were the ones who were wrong! I couldn't believe my ears! When I politely told her again that was not what we had ordered she kept arguing with us and then just took the food and left. I was beside myself. I have never been treated so badly in a restaurant before. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and she shot back that there was not a supervisor on that night. Yeah I believe that. So we promptly left and were NEVER not once offered one single apology, instead we were told that we were wrong and then ignored. Will never set foot in this establishment again and I hope to speak with the owner to let him/her know the level of wait staff they have representing their restaurant."
0,"I received two calls from the driver telling me he is on his way (AFTER the time he was supposed to arrive) so I continued to wait for him as the clock ticked on... then the driver calls to tell me \""I'm here\"" but when I looked out the window, no one was there. Turns out he went to the \""west\"" street rather than where I was located, which was the \""north\"" street. Didn't matter because he called to tell me this 21 minutes past the time he was supposed to arrive, so I would have missed my plane anyway. Which is exactly what ended up happening. \nVery, very frustrating."
0,"Stayed 3 nights at the Grand and it was an absolutely terrible experience, found hair in my bed that obviously was not mine, even after I called and talked to the director of housekeeping the problem was not resolved! So gross! Never will I stay here again!! The manager of the hotel didn't even take time to contact me and fix this issue terrible terrible costumer service."
3,"Good food and beer selection. Service is hit or miss, so I wouldn't suggest going in if you are in a rush! Menu is great, I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like. The Veggie Panini, Caprese Chicken Sandwich or any of the flatbreads are my favorite. I always get a side of ranch if I get fries, the peppercorn ranch is awesome! Lots of TVs for game viewing, and a really nice patio space. One of the better restaurants in Tempe Marketplace, worth checking out!"
0,"I am actually a NP who against my better judgement sent my husband there to have IV hydration due to a bout of vomiting & diarrhea. First he had to wait almost two hrs to be seen. Secondly, they had to stick him with the IV three times (which happens sometimes) but continued to run the IV on the third attempt which infiltrated and he only received a 1/4 of the bag. What infuriates me, is that his chart, states none of this. According to what was written, he had one failed IV attempt then received a liter of fluids over 45 minutes. So he received absolutely no help and was sent home in the same shape as when he went in."
4,"We have been taking our pets to the vet at American Pet Hospital for more than 8 years.  Recently, our beloved family dog became ill with cancer and we had to put him to sleep.  The entire staff at APH was amazing throughout the entire experience, from diagnosis, to our last trip.  Today, we received a sympathy card from them in the mail.  Our hearts were touched, but imagine how surprised we were to open that card and see that many of the staff members had written personal messages to us!  (We often used their boarding services, so many of the staff members had spent time with our dog.)  The time and attention they gave us was amazing.  I would highly recommend American Pet Hospital.  They are truly wonderful, caring people!"
0,"Pros : clean place\nCons: lots. The service was horrible, especially when you are paying pretty high for the food and drinks. Cocktail Drinks cost about $10 and entries average about $16-$24. And when you get bad service for spending so much, that would drive me crazy. \n\nDrinks and food were ok. Not the quality I expected. There r lots of other restaurants on mill ave that are far better.\n\nIn short, I personally would not recommend this place to any of my friends n relatives."
2,"The crepe was really good.\n\nWhat's the problem then? I asked for mine to go, as I had to run back to the hotel to check out.  \""To go\"" apparently means on an open paper plate you get to carry through the streets to the Metro while scarfing down a bite here and there. \n\nWhen I expressed surprise about this not being really a practical to-go package, all I got back was \""That's how we do it.\""  Crepes are really easy to wrap up in a paper triangle, which is how they've been served to me in the past.  \n\nSo... don't take it to go."
0,"Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!"
2,"Fine place to go if you want a casual dinner but don't expect much more.  Well priced, many options, everything good but nothing amazing.  Loud atmosphere, service fine. If you're looking for a more celebrity chef type restaurant you can easily find better options."
4,"I have a hard time picking between this and Mac's Speed Shop for best BBQ in the city. Midwood is really close to my condo so I usually go here. \n\nOddly enough their pulled pork is my least favorite thing here. But literally everything else I've had on the menu is out of this world. Bacon wrapped jalape\u00f1os... umm YES. Brisket is phenomenal, BBQ chicken isn't run of the mill chicken at all, extremely flavorful and different. Just thinking about the smell of this place makes me hungry.\n\nTip: if you get the BBQ chicken instead of the mustard based BBQ sauce ask to get a few different ones on the side so you can taste them all."
1,"Waited for 45 minutes on a weeknight before we got our table. Table view was amazing on the second floor but that was the only thing amazing during that night. Dynamite Shrimp had no kick at all, Dandan Noodles were soggy, Mongolian Beef was overcooked and chewy and our Calamari appetizer came AFTER our entrees were served. Our server was really efficient though, refilling our waters on point and following up on our calamari. But if i wanted asian/chinese food, i wouldn't go back to PF Changs."
3,"HH is the kind of place you go to when you're low on cash, it's Monday night & you are willing to drive to pick up your food.  They used to offer a medium 1-topping pizza for $5.55 on Monday nights.  Last wk when I called to order the special, they said it changed to a large for $5.99.  The beauty of this offer is that you don't have to buy 3 pizzas to get that price like the other chains!!!!!  With the economy in the toilet, I was astounded that they increased the size thereby improving the value for my hard earned dollars.  \n\nAs for taste & quality--it's pretty good.  I like to order the thin crust and usually get sausage or pepperoni anything extra, I add on myself (e.g., red onion, black olives, etc).  They don't glop on the sauce or skimp on the cheese & I've never rec'd a burnt/nearly burnt pizza.  It's even pretty good reheated."
2,"Interesting to I must say.. had a couple of first.\n\nHad Durian smoothie and friend had Jackfruit the durian was not to my liking but I can say I triied it. \n\nFresh rolls or ( spring rolls ), foot long sandwich with Korean beef was mine and friend had the pho' with steak flank. \n\nThe spring rolls really good though I was missing basil ? I have been to a couple of pho places that put basil in them tastes really great that way, however can tell there really fresh. The Korean Beef Sandwich was really good I have a few suggestions though its hard to eat cilantro as a whole with stem attached maybe they could pick apart or chop also the cucumbers instead of slicing them on a bias maybe try julienne them this would look really cool to match the carrots they have its kinda hard biting into a amazing baguette and have to chew for five minutes with out chocking. The Korean beef was flavorful and tasted yummy. \n\nThe pho looked amazing I also seen some pho dishes that looked like crispy beef or chitlins ? maybe next try that. The bread was amazing normally I dont get excited bout that but have had some bad experiences in the past either soggy bread or worse \n\nOverall ok"
0,"My son, one of his friends and I went to L8 Night Bingo tonite. I have played Bingo at CA many times and never paid much attention to details. We all paid for the same package. At one point we noticed that I had twice as many cards as my son, then noticed his friend had 3 times as many cards on each game. When my son questioned them about it they called security and took him to some office. Then they threatened him with the police and accused him of things he did not do. Watch out for these people. If you catch them cheating you may find yourself being detained."
0,"Most boring strip club in Phoenix metro. For typ Sat nite, Paid 13 bucks cover, yes 13! Why 13?  Then one bud light bottle cost 6.25 round that up to 7 for tip, then a lousy table dance for 10 bucks. I lost 30 bucks in 15 minutes. After that, I even rejected one girl cause she looked high on something and ugly with her eyes half opened. I am a local and I am never going back there again."
3,Used to be a cheesy place but now it's classy and centrally located. It's rather affordable too!
2,"I dined here on a recent trip to Vegas.\n\nI had the Kobe beef sliders.  They were ok, but not worth the $13 I paid for them.  (Side note:  My friend almost got sick from eating them because they were too rich for her liking.)  I also had their Shichimi fries.  Those were good - nice & spicy.  Also had some Yukon Gold mashers, and those were good too.\n\nThey poured decent cocktails.  \n\nI would probably go here again next time I go to Vegas if I am hungry and in the area."
3,"I generally love Korean BBQ as it is so tasty and delicious. Normally the places I go to are not so \""inviting\"", but this place is a nice place to go.\n\nAtmosphere - Very clean, big and roomy restaurant. Well designed. Many of the places around Sahara Commercial Center and the older places are, well,  old.  This place is easy on the eyes for sure.\n\nService - Very nice attentive and helpful, especially for novice BBQ eaters. If it gets busy though,  you will need to be a bit more assertive and ask for things. \n\nFood - Very nice, went for the Pork and beef. All nice and subtle tasting wtih not too much overpowering spices.  Kim Chi selection was nice, but very, westernized, meaning, that there were mostly the mild type of Kim Chi. They will refill for you based on request.  Odd that they do not serve a soup with the meal.  Fire was a bit low, so things took time to cook. Overall pretty nice.\n\nSelection - A bit more on the food. I usually order Bulgogi or Kalbi, and here they have various levels of quality of beef that I normally am not used to, so be prepared that you have choices in quality. More expensive, more quality the cut. I find, however, that proper marinade and tenderizing the meat and proper slicing make for a great meal, and I am not one to really be able to tell the great cut of meat in Korean BBQ. So, i ordered the least expensive.\n\nOther - I will for sure go back as it is easy to get to and park, as it is in Chinatown plaza, and it is fun to stroll around the little plaza and see what else is going on. Be sure, if you are on a date, to bring some mints and gum with you. The food has a lot of garlic.....\n\nCheck it out for sure."
2,"Now this is a true dive.  I believe the sign out front says that they open at 6a.m.  And no, they don't open that early to serve you scrambled eggs and coffee ;)  \n\nLadies, smart to walk with sharp side of your keys out when walking in the parking lot.  Better to wait for your friend (or date but that would be a very unromantic date) in the bar rather than sitting outside Wanderin.  \n\nThe name 'Wanderin' fits.... That is what it feels most of the patrons did ... literally  'wander in' to the bar.  Quite random... older crowd... heavy drinkers...  That is not to say very friendly... had a great debate on the correct recipe for a Moscow Mule with a gentleman down the bar.  No one won, since neither of us had cool phones with internet capabilities. This is not the place to order a cosmopolitan, wear patent leather pumps or sport that pseudo Louis Vuitton purse :)  \n\nI 100% agree with the other reviewer.. this is a MUST visit on any dive bar crawl."
2,Good but not the real deal.  The big 3 pizza deep dish places in Chicago I feel are better.
4,"I am still coming to the same Firestone years later and the same guys still work there and they are still good to me. The make sure I don't pay for services I don't need and when I do need something, they make sure it is taken care of asap and try to make sure it doesn't cost a small fortune. Even my coworkers in my office have started going to this location and they guys are good to them. Plus they know if they aren't I would give them hell, and the last thing they want is a mad Ebony on their hands lol. I trust them as they know my car is important to me. So in a nutshell, yes I still like this Firestone. The end! :)"
1,"I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with Nee House. They treat me like shit but I keep coming back for more because their authentic dishes make me love them long time (inappropriate? Eh). I mean, it's never a shock when I come in and the staff makes me feel as if I just dropped into their home without calling first, but today they really turned me off with their rudeness.\n\nI go in at about 2:45pm with my daughter for lunch. There is only one table being used. The woman points to the table right next to the only people eating at the restaurant. So, I smile but went one table over and sat down. The woman comes out of the kitchen and says \""no, can you sit at that table over there?\"" I looked at her as if questioning why I couldn't sit at the table I had chosen, and she pointed to one of the large, family-style tables right next to the table I had chosen, and said \""they're going to have dinner\"". I moved, but was very perplexed as to what the issue was. Aren't all the tables there for a reason? And who eats dinner at 3 in the afternoon? Anyway, I shook it off and ordered the shrimp and eggplant in Szechuan sauce; it was amazing, as usual. My daughter enjoyed her chicken lo mein. What I didn't love is how the waitress brought out one dish way before the other, and never acknowledged our numerous friendly \""thank you's\"". She just had this energy that yelled \""this is the last thing I want to be doing right now. Why are you here?!\""\n\nThen....the staff starts coming out of the kitchen to that table that I wasn't allowed to sit near. THAT'S why I couldn't sit there?! I guess I am a second-class citizen that cannot sit at my preferred table if it is too close to the staff as they eat their food. Totally turned me off. Ridiculous. And for those who claim \""it's about the food, not the service\"", that is ridiculous too. When you eat out, the way you are treated as well as how delicious the food is contributes to your experience as a whole. Is the food good? Absolutely. Does this mean that it's a good experience? Probably not. \n\nI vowed to never go back....at least until I get another craving for that shrimp dish-- with a side of jerk sauce."
1,"I wish this update was for a bump up to 4 stars, unfortunately it is not. If I had written this Friday night and they didn't offer good vegan options it could have easily been a 1 star review.\n\nThe funny part of this saga is I had completely forgotten about my prior review which had to do with Pizza Heaven figuring out orders with different toppings, charges, etc. \n\nRecently I have been complaining about how expensive Z pizza has been getting, Pizza Heaven's location is closer and I thought would be cheaper so here goes; round two.\n\nThe order: 3 topping large pizza with vegan cheese, on their menu listed for $17.50. When I arrived to pick up the pie I was told \"" That will be $27.?? \"" What?!?! \""No, I just had a 3 topping pizza, just one...nothing else\"".\n\nThis is where the discussion began on how they charge for toppings, apparently their policy is to rip people off? I think we all learned in the 4th grade (ok maybe not) if you put 3 toppings on one half and 3 toppings on the second half you have used the same amount of toppings for the pie - the toppings may be different yes, but the net amount of toppings used (and might I add purchased by the establishment) is still the same. Since my girlfriend can't stand onions, and I hate those little black olives we each had our own side of 3 toppings each BUT...get this....were charged for 6 toppings! Recap: no more toppings were used total on the pizza but because they were all different apparently they have made it a policy to charge for 6 toppings. The vegan cheese was also an extra $2 but not listed on their menu online (or at the restaurant). \n\nThey ended up comping me for one topping and I didn't throw too much of a fight because I knew I would not be coming back anytime soon. Once I got home and tried the pizza it did nothing more then seal the deal. It wasn't the worse pizza but it was mediocre at best.\n\nI don't feel great about writing this review, I really want to love and support independent businesses in Phoenix but when they have crazy policies like this and I have to spend $27+ to get a large mediocre pizza I need to draw the line somewhere. Phoenix has very few vegan pizza options but right now it seems like the corporate giants win again - I can get a large surfboard vegan pizza at Whole Foods, with any 3 toppings on any half, which tastes great for $15.99; no hassles.\n\nLastly I would like to comment that the girl working the cashier was very friendly and very courteous even though I was displaying clear signs of being utterly appalled. Even when I left she was still very friendly, it's safe to say she saved this from being a one star review, kudos to you."
1,"Hmmmm...I've tried the Fireside Lounge twice now.  I just...don't...get it.  \n\nWhy is this place so popular?  \n\nIs it the decor of very faded and cigarette burned booths?  The plastic, fake trees?  The smoke-so-thick-you-can-slice-it air?  The aggravating eye-soar pink lights?\n\nIt definitely isn't the drinks.  My friend's Jack and Coke was pretty much just Coke.  My chocolate chip cookie martini wasn't anything special or something that I couldn't find at TGIFridays.\n\nI just don't get the hype about this place.  Sorry."
0,"Check your credit card!\nI booked through priceline for a total of $99\nWhen I got home, I had a resort fee of $22 and some random charge of $79.\nI had to call their accounts payable department to get the $79 refunded. \nI asked to have the resort fee refunded as well but was told to talk to the front desk supervisor. \ni spoke with a woman that was not the supervisor and she wouldn't transfer me. \nI explained that the two amex charges I was charged equaled teh two charges they charged me. \nShe explained in different words teh same thing - they can't refund a resort fee. \nShe then explained that the $79 wasn't an additional room charge but rather an error. \nShe didn't indicate what the error was. \nReally, they just randomly charge extra charges and hope you catch it?\nI wonder how many other people out there got charged extra and didn't catch it. \nTrust level with this hotel = 0"
3,"Love this place...been for brunch and dinner several times since it opened, highly recommend the pancakes and bacon, the street tacos, the chicken mole and paella.  The otro salad is excellent, as are the mojitos.."
2,"34.99 plus tax on a Monday night dinner. Food was okay, service was okay, price was okay. Three stars overall. The main attraction for me was the king crab, which can easily be $25-35 per pound in the stores. Honestly, the crab was \""meh.\"" The legs were small and a little over salted. So my next go to was sushi. The rolls looked disappointing (too much rice and not enough fish) so I went for the tuna nigiri which was pretty good quality. The rest of their cooked food was okay but nothing really stood out. There's a wide variety of desserts, but none of them were really outstanding. Many of them are more pretty than tasty."
0,"A completely avoidable 3 HOUR tarmac delay in a frozen cabin!  NEVER flying US airways again.\n\nMy connecting flight from PHX to OAK came to the gate with a known major technical issue in the cockpit which would prevent proper pre-flight checks.\n\nThey boarded us anyway rather than provide a different plane. As one of the first people on board I saw 3 maintenance staff already present on the aircraft.\n\nWe received no status and upon inquiry (after 45 minutes with no action), they \""claimed\"" it was the first officer's seat-belt that needed replacement.   Seat belts don't take 3 hours to replace, nor do they require 4 levels of maintenance staff.  They had us sit there in a plane cold enough to ship freshly packed meat for 3 freaking hours.\n\nBy the time we took off I had developed a 103 fever.  I should sue them on behalf of my company, as I'll probably be down for the rest of the week trying to recover.\n\nThey also violated FAA/DOT rules regarding provision of adequate food/hydration, and after something so egregious, they offered nothing in compensation."
2,"Came back for dinner on a Sunday night - the place was WAY less crowded then it was when we first visited.  Could be that it was not a popular day to go out to eat, or that the excitement of the grand opening has died down, or it could be that we came during the Steelers/Jets playoff game and everyone was at a bar somewhere.  Whichever.  It was quieter, in a good way.  They have a full bar now, and the TVs were playing the game, not Bollywood movies.\n\nWe got the buffet, which I think was about $10.  They had a pretty good selection of things - several vegetarian offerings (aloo gobi, chana masala, potatoes in spinach, paneer in tomato sauce), and chicken tikka masala, tandoor chicken, goat biryani, spicy chicken wings, and various other things.  Also two soups, a little salad area, a handful of condiments/chutneys, and a few sweet dessert-ish things.  And naan.\n\nEverything was pretty good - on the lukewarm side, as per usual for a buffet, but I appreciated the wide variety of options.  It was a good deal for the price.  Still, I think the quality (and temperature) of the food is higher when you order off the menu.  Nothing wowed me enough to bump them up to a four-star review.  it was standard Indian buffet fare - tasty, well-priced, all the usual suspects.  But next time I want to get the more creative and spicy options that aren't on the buffet line!"
0,"Breakfast is all pre-cooked.  Ham boiled.  Ordered bacon well but it comes however it is cooked prior.  No special orders here.  Not that cheap either.  Just fast, that's all!"
3,The interior is phenomenal and the music was great! Get there earlier if you want your conversation to be heard better but still a great place to kickback with friends.
0,"NOT our cup of tea. \n\nWith that said, the place is cute and the workers are nice so I would love to give them more stars but I'm basing it solely on our taste.  \n\nThese are not ordinary waffles but liege waffles meaning they are infused with sugar balls in them. We were expecting more options than liege waffles since our whole family love waffles but guess we didn't research enough. \n\nWe ordered 1) plain, 2) whipped cream 3) nutella & berries. The plain enough was so sweet that we could barely finish it. My son who LOVES waffles and nutella AND whipped cream took 2 bites and said he couldn't eat it. \n\nIf you love sugary stuff this is the place for you! But for us it was too over the top and we couldn't enjoy the waffle or its toppings as much as we would have liked to."
4,"Ever since I moved from Hawaii I'm always on the lookout for something similar to Kuru Kuru from back home...therefore, I'm always looking for something deliciously cheap and with hugemangous portions --- YES, I SAID HUGEMANGOUS!\n\nMy friend, who's a sushi chef @ Marssa, kept telling me that Xtreme Sushi by my house was his favorite spot and I kept thinking he must be crazy cuz it's off strip and in a still developing area; AND I couldn't believe a place near my house was THAT good (let it be known that Southern Highlands is in dire need of foodie spots).\n\nI should've listened to him a long time ago...I'M AN IDIOT!\n\nALL-YOU-CAN-EAT lunch special is at 12-3 and it's UNDER $20!!! I think dinner is around $24, which is average. \n\nAnd it really is all you can eat! Like, EVERYTHING ON THE MENU!!!!!! E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. (except sashimi) But, there's appetizers, specialty rolls, curry, soba, ramen; I can go on & on & on...\nAnd trust me, I tried eating on & on &on... \n\nThe pieces of unagi were hugemangous..the same for the yellowtail =) And the sushi tasted so fresh. It's like they have the ocean in the backyard and they catch the stuff right before serving! Unbelievable. \n\nThe specialty rolls were ahhhhh-maaaa-zing! And you can order smaller portions with pieces of 4 so, you can SAMPS more rolls. My favorites were the Kayla and some unagi roll which was crisp on the inside and outside.\n\nAfter this lunch feast, I was done. SPOILED! I absolutely cannot eat at any other spot than this...EVEN SUSHIMON SUCKS in comparison. Believe it.\nNow, I tell all my friends, I don't want to eat at another sushi spot if I know I can get all-you-can-eat ridiculously hugemangously yummy sushi here!\n\nDo yourself a favor and SAMPS this place! And if you're eating lunch here, LET ME KNOW, I'll meet you. \nI am always looking for an excuse to eat up.... =)"
0,"We stopped in opening day to check out what they did with sahara , as i used to work there. The exterior looks good. The interior is either a 60s modern look or i thought it just looked cheap . Lipstick and mirrors. The porters and stewards mustve been off . How would a high class joint have big dust bunnys blowing out from under tables and the bathrooms were a mess and out of towels. But the clincher was when leavin the parking garage has 2 sets of 2 elevators. And i remember them not workin great when it was sahara. But hey it was facelifted . I guess the mechanical side was forgotten for all parking garage elevators were out on opening day . Had to walk to the 6th floor of the parking garage in 100 degree heat. And watching the elderly and the handicapp having to walk up the stairs to there vehicles showed me what they think of locals. Will not be back and would never recommend this property to anyone."
2,"My friends and I ate here after a night of dancing. \nWe ordered the buffalo wings, chicken enchaladas & chicken and waffles..\n\nThe buffalo wings were flavorless. \n\nThe chicken enchaladas were good and cheesy with nice amounts of chicken inside.\n\nChicken and waffles was about 4 strips of chicken on a thick waffle. Waffle was standard but the chicken was nice a crunchy. \n\nGreat place to go late night. Atmosphere nice and bright and the servers are fun and friendly."
2,"The first time couple of times I went there they were closer to four stars, but this last trip put them at a three star. The combo Kung pao was just average. I really hate meat that is mushy, and that's what the beef was. This is just your average Chinese joint with a nice decor."
3,"Used my Groupon for a massage and blow out. Massage was very relaxing. Shampoo and style were ok. Stylist was a little slow to style my hair, as he was using a blow dryer that wasn't very powerful. Overall a pleasant experience. Friendly staff and central location. I will book a repeat appointment."
1,"This is NOT the best galatto in the valley. Although the view of the fountain is nice, it was way over priced for the lack of flavor. It wasn't bad, but is there such a thing as bad galatto?"
3,Oh so good!  In vegas for vacation and decided one day to have a heavy lunch before hitting the strip; this sounded like it would fit the bill - and it did!\n\nI had a classic this time and can't wait to try some of the others.
0,"Direct Buy solicited me at the June 2013 First Friday event downtown. I fell for the pitch...and signed up for them to contact me. Everything looked good especially the part about saving money for name brand stuff. But things came to a screeching halt when they called me back 4 days after signing up, which just happened to be about 60 seconds ago as I'm writing this. They have an archaic policy that if you are married or have a significant other that they must be present on your first visit. Well, in our relationship we have our areas of expertise, and one of us will check things out and then if we like it then we bring the other into it. I flat out told the Direct Buy rep that I refuse to accept their archaic, asinine, and dare I say it downright sexist policy.\n\nThere is no deal out there that warrants changing what works for me and my family. Kinetico tried the same stunt to sell us a water softener in that they want to do the full court press and if the man won't go for it, they'll persuade the woman to do it. Sorry...I don't do high pressure sales tactics nor will I put my family into that kind of situation. \n\nThis review will be monitored. I signed up for their list, I got called by their direct marketer, I had a direct experience with Direct Buy, and if this negative review gets yanked I will be on this with lightning speed."
1,"Well, at least the owner is consistent.  As with Roka Akor, this place had great style in the decor, but the food just was not very good.  We ordered chicken tikka masala and a curry.  Both of the sauces were flavorful and balanced, but none of the flavors penetrated the meats in the curries.  It almost tasted like the curry was cooked in one pot, the meat was boiled in water and the meat was dropped into the curry at the last minute.  Maybe its the old school in me, but its such a waste to order a meat dish and leave the meat behind.  The search continues for good Indian food in my hood..."
4,"I always thought that dogs eat any and everything. That was until I rescued my two-year old German Shepherd named Bear. She's finicky and choosy and this can be extremely frustrating and stressful -- particularly when people would stop me on a walk around the block and comment \""is your mom feeding you?!\"" (thank you people, by the way, not intrusive at all). \n\nI popped into 4 Paws Holistic for help, and got so much more. With Bear by my side, she sampled different foods and treats and I was able to see right there what she liked or didn't like. Their customer service team was happy to talk me through different options - raw food, dry food, a combination thereof - that would get Bear eating and put some weight on her. \n\nMy experience every time has been great, and 4 Paws Holistic is my go-to for picking up Bear's dog food, treats and bully sticks."
3,"I picked this place for its pools. Overall everything was well but I think staying here once will be enough for us. The reason? There were WAY too many lifeguards. The problem with this is you can't dive, you can't run or walk along the wave action pool, you can't stand by the wave to get hit in the face with a wave, which I actually wanted, you can't take a raft to the lazy river. FFS! Tubes only in the lazy river and good luck finding a chair after noon because you probably won't. The pools also close at 7pm so no sexy time in the jacuzzi late night. We opted out on the cabanas but found a couple of chairs our first and 3rd day but our 2nd day, we had to lay on the sand. If you only want a jacuzzi minus the kids, I suggest you walk to the south lagoon for the jacuzzi hot tub there. You can relax there if you don't have kids. Anyways, this place still gets a 4 star from me. Safety is important and they can't help the crowds. It's a very fun resort and another wonderful casino floor plan from this company."
2,"What actually makes a good Chinese takeaway? Because isn't all Chinese takeaway food the same? It's always too sweet, full of MSG and congealed. So it doesn't really matter which Chinese takeaway you go to, you can expect the same thing.\n\nGili Gulu, unfortunately, isn't much different. I mean, it's a little better, in that the sauces aren't as thick. But everything is so sweet. I'm giving them 3* because it's one of the better Chinese takeaways I've ever had, but that isn't saying much. I had shredded chilli beef, which was OK. The beef was soggy, not crispy, but the sauce was suitably hot and the rice was nice and fluffy. \n\nDelivery was pretty prompt, and we did get a free bag of prawn crackers (and I do love prawn crackers), but I should really stop getting Chinese takeaways. You're better off making it yourself, or going out to a restaurant."
2,"Mediocre sports bar. The place is clean and looks nice, but honestly there is nothing that really sets it apart from any other place around town.\n\nOne issue I have is the lack of selections for someone that eats vegetarian/vegan. Even some pretzel bites or hummus would be nice."
4,"I absolutely adore Lush!  They have so many amazing products, and the staff are always friendly and extremely helpful.  So far I've only tried the bubble bars, bath bombs, and one soap,  which are all fabulous.  I definitely plan to branch out and try some of their other products."
3,"Always good food and wine here. Tonight we each had the green salad with beets. My wife added grilled NC shrimp (an $8 add on). Nicely prepared and flavored. I had the salad without any add ons, but I once again succumbed to the sliders; done perfectly.  We left with a smile on on faces."
4,Loved it! Best French toast ever!
3,It's cirque so u know it's going to be good. The real only flaw is the somewhat vague storyline but who cares about storylines when u r watching incredibly creative set and costume and choreography. \nAfter a few beers I realized that the KA storyline is basically star wars.  If you keep that in mind it all makes sense- Luke and princess leah versus Darth vader and the emporor. Easy as that
4,"We went here recently on a Thursday evening and got a table with no waiting.  Choosing a cocktail was difficult as there were several intriguing options but I settled on the Lorraine, a gin and elderflower liqueur concoction.  It was delicious and well crafted, with just the right amount of \""punch.\""\n\nMy companion and I split the Albondigas appetizer, which was a small serving of meatballs simmered in an amazing tomato sauce.  The sauce was rich and tangy and, after we raved about it, our server brought us a serving of bread to sop up the rest.\n\nI ordered the chickpea goulash, which was surprisingly rich, given its simple ingredients.  I also had the sauteed greens, which were a bit salty for my taste but still good.  My companion ordered the Chrurrasco beef, which was definitely the best thing we ate there.  The chimichurri sauce was perfect and the beef was tender and cooked to order.  \n\nWe split that evening's dessert special, an apple and carmel bread pudding, served wam with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  Delicious.\n\nif you know this place from when it was Mildred's, you'll recognize the layout of the booths, but everything has been redone in beautiful wood, dark, rich colors, and indirect lighting.  There's a small bar in the back now and a nice little patio.\n\nIf you're thinking of going here, do it now.  I'm sure that once word of mouth starts to spread on this place it will be difficult to get a table, especially since they don't take reservations."
4,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  The fried green tomato BLT sandwich with pimento cheese is divine.  It goes great with the pomme frites and a trio of aioli sauces for dipping.  The calamari is also terrific.  It is lightly breaded and cooked to perfection with this amazing Asian Love Sauce.
0,"This is the most unprofessional dentist office we have ever been to! From the first phone call to make an appointment to the first visit and exam, we have been completely unsatisfied! \n\nThey never explained what was being done and made us feel bad when my daughter had milk for breakfast when we were never told she couldn't have dairy prior to her appointment. \n\nMy daughter was in so much pain she came out crying. When I asked them if it should be pressure and not pain that she feels he dismissively said, \""sure!\""\n\nThen they never gave us after care instructions. I had to call them when I got home to find out if she needed to wait an hour before she could eat or if it was okay to give her motrin even though she had laughing gas. \n\nPrior to this, my daughter loved going to the dentist. If you do not want your child traumatized, do not go to this dentist. They are unprofessional and do not care!"
0,"Really, $100 for this cheesy show with mimes and practically nothing but drum music.  A big part of the show was the blue men catching stuff in their mouths.  Some drums had colored water on them and they made interesting effects when struck, and they had some unusual percussion instruments, but for the same money I enjoyed Phantom of the Opera and Jersey Boys much more.  They make some pretentious points about the isolation of man due to technology, but use technology to do it?!?  One act was to get an audience member, put him in overalls, paint him blue and smack him against a canvas, Lettermen did better years ago.  To end the show they T.P.ed the audience, yeah pretty much dumped something like toliet paper on all of use and we were supposed to pass it forward, Vegas can do much better."
4,"Its been a few years since I've been, but damn this pizza was good!. I remember it gets really hot (in the summer) and noisy on weekend nights. Otherwise, a wonderful place to go with friends, share a bottle, eat some tasty pizza, and go home happy. Clearly a must-try."
3,"Let me begin with how shocked I was once I entered the Golden Nugget. I did not expect it to be so nice. A couple of friends and I were going out for lunch. I was early, so I took a stroll around the property and was blown away by how modern and clean everything was.\n\nAt first, I was apprehensive about the separated dining area. During peak hours, crossing traffic to get to the part near the pool must be similar to playing Frogger with a banquet tray. The weather was gorgeous and the pool is beautiful, so I understand why they seat this area first. As the first party there, for lunch, we got a central table near the window. \n\nOctober is pizza month. They are running a chef's special for $9.99. The special is a basic cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil pizza. It was delicious and easily shared between two. So why in the world did we get bruschetta, chicken fettuccine alfredo, and lasagna? Both pastas also comes with an Italian salad. It was was overkill. Yet, it was also a death I am willing to experience again. I am not a huge fan of cream sauces, but I even took a few bites of the pasta. The lasagna was my favorite. It is a bit more saucy than I normally like, but the flavor was good. The pizza is a thin crust style that I was thankful for because I could not handle any more carbs. By the time all three of us were finished we had enough to send someone home with leftovers."
2,"Comfortably Decent\nBy no means the greatest bar in Madison, but I'd say it's quite a bit better than the handful of other bars within 1-2 blocks of it.\nThe decor is alright, but I'm easily mesmerized by a fish tank. The outdoor patio is large, but therefore quite popular. Menu is okay, but heavy on burgers. My tilapia sandwich was quite satisfactory, though. And I'm always a sucker for waffle fries."
4,"If you're planning to come here during Spring Training season; MAKE A RESERVATION!! They start taking reservations on their website a month in advance for this time of year, and there's a reason for that. It is very, very popular. We had a reservation for 8:15pm on a Thursday night in March. We arrived about a 1/2 hour before our reservation, and when I checked in, the hostess said our table would be ready around the time of our reservation. Not a problem. We went to the bar, got drinks, and then wandered around & looked/took pictures of all the incredible sports memorabilia on the walls/ceilings. The place is incredible.\nThe food: fantastic! If you check-in on Yelp, they've got an offer for a free onion strings or garlic cheese toast appetizer. My boyfriend go the prime rib & I got the ribs (\""Don's way\""). We both loved our selections. The ribs weren't fall-off-the-bone type ribs, but they were fantastic. I loved that there wasn't too much sauce. \nThe tables are pretty close together in the restaurant because they try to use as much space as possible. This ended up being great for us though because we met two awesome men who were on their 24th Spring Training trip together. They were very enjoyable to talk to & I'm really glad we decided to talk to them. They've been coming to Don & Charlie's since the very beginning, and we hope to make it a tradition as well!"
4,this place is great'' I would highly recomend this buffet to everyone who go to vegas. first thing was the pizza it was good and big.second was the pasta tortaini with the alfrado sasue.third was the sushi it was small but it was good and last but not least the dessert was awsome the puding was nice and creamy and the fruit was fruity and the chessecake was magnificent  everything in the buffet was good.
4,"My first review, for a place worth reviewing! Was looking for food places in north Las Vegas for when me and my friends come up from San Diego for the spartan race, and i am sooo glad I came across this! Best poke in the mainland!! So many choices and all of them are sooo good!!! I ended up getting the ahi furikake, garlic ahi poke with shoyu and salmon poke with special sauce... I only got less than 1lb of each cause of it being perishable and we had a 5-6hr drive back to San Diego. ;( ;( I wish they had a store in SD cause I would be hitting it up everyday! The owner and I think it might've been his son? were really nice!! They totally showed the aloha spirit. Now I know why the have perfect ratings. Next time I come to Las Vegas, I am definitely hitting this place up again! This place is def a \""must go-to\"" spot now for me."
0,"I absolutely love and know good sushi, and this was not.  The rolls were small with lots of rice and very little fish.  For a table of multiple people they put wasabi and ginger on only one plate! The service was terrible to say the least. Rude and was only there when she was not needed and never there when she was.  The price did not match the quality."
3,"Just got back from breakfast at the 40th Street Cafe.  For a Tuesday morning, it was BUSY.  Only a couple tables open.  My waitress Sherrie was a total delight; I never saw a smile leave her face.\n\nI ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant (75 cents extra, totally worth it), sub bacon instead of ham, and sub scrambled eggs instead of the over hard egg just like I saw in a picture here on yelp.  It was great!  Loads of bacon, the eggs were great (not dry like other breakfast places like to serve you).  The hashbrowns were good - although not seasoned at all, like another reviewer noted, so I had to salt them myself... but that seems to be a norm for breakfast places like these, since a lot of their clientele is of the older generation who can't handle salt.\n\nLots of regulars here, lots of people just sitting drinking coffee and reading the paper.  Although one woman was totally rude and annoying - my waitress was taking the order of a woman sitting at the table next to me, and a woman at the table across the aisle threw her wadded-up straw wrapper at the waitress while she was taking the order - it almost landed in the full pot of coffee on the table - then apologized to the customer getting her order taken, saying she was trying to hit the waitress, and let out the most ungodly hyena-like guffaw I've ever heard.  I get that you know the waitress and you're trying to be funny, but jesus christ.  Have some respect and try to contain yourself.  She was at least 60 years old btw.\n\nANYWAY, overall it was a great experience and I had a good time just sitting there eating watching the price is right on their 20-year-old television.  I'll be heading back there for sure."
3,"Very clean, fast service, very nice employees and good subs!!"
1,"If you like filthy buses, super high fares and about 50% rude operators then you will love Port Authority service.  Now if you like clean buses, reasonable fares and friendly service you will need to go somewhere else.  And no place for children as the language on the buses would make a sailor blush.  And in 14 years of riding Port Authority I have never seen a uniformed Port Authority officer riding a bus."
1,"Okay so I'm not really sure why so many reviewers are semi-positive about this place. I can't say I'd ever go back. One positive is the lobby of the Artisan is really cool. Great attention to detail.\n\nWe didn't know where \""Mood\"" was so we asked the front desk guy, who, rather coldly, just pointed in its direction. We then arrived to what we assumed was the restaurant (A giant menu poster gave it away, so we thought).\n\nWe then stood in front of this menu poster for 10 minutes waiting for some sign of life to greet us. We then decided to venture to the bar to try and get some understanding how the seating works in this place we nicknamed \""The Twilight Zone\"". The bartender told us to just sit anywhere. From that moment on the meal and the overall experience was a real snooze. The server had no personality and the food was okay and definitely not worth the prices."
4,"Just finished a wonderful dinner here!  Never had Turkish food before.  Will be coming back soon!  The Kuru Fasulye a white bean and chopped lamb dish was delightful.   The Lentil soup was velvety smooth and seasoned perfectly.   Turkish baklava is softer and chewier than most others, not overly sweet.  MUST have the Turkish coffee with it!   Awesome.   Staff was friendly and welcoming.   I highly recommend it.  Like a mini Mediterranean vaca!"
2,"First, it is dark and you can't tell if it is even still in business when we were walking up. They need some sort of sign of life out front. We went here on a week night thinking it was Happy Hour menu. There were 3 of us. We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all. And thinking Happy hour pricing. The server was training someone. You could tell they had both been drinking already. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there. I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering. The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available. We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived. Usually tapas comes a few things at a time. Here it took forever and then BAM, it was all on the table. I have to say everything was delicious. I refused to share the beef tenderloin. The Sangria was very good too. After we ate we couldn't take anything as it doesn't travel well. So, don't overorder. The check came and we were surprised at the amount. My daughter had just been there the week before and they had Happy hour pricing at the time we were there. We asked the waitress what was going on with the check. She gave a long winded story about new specials and hours for Christmas shoppers. And went on forever, about lunch specials. Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes. I know, we should have asked. But it is also good customer service to say \""sorry you just missed Happy Hour\"". Especially since it changed from the previous week. We would have ordered the same anyway. It's the point that of all the 1000's of places in Vegas, we went there for food and Happy Hour. I am undecided if I will return. The service is the lowest. But the food is really good. For sure it won't be until summer. I hate eating in a winter coat. Maybe by summer they will have better service and people watching?"
0,"The service at this place is by far the worst service we've every received in this service industry town.\n\nHere's what we love: The food is great. The portions are very fair for what you pay. And that's why we've eaten there 4 times...... but.... here comes the bad....\n\nHere's what we hate: The location stinks for parking (remember to bring your walking shoes!). The stupid black/yellow egg thing is a cop-out excuse for lazy servers (flip it if you need anything - Here's my first 'why are we tipping you?'). If you like more than one drink, forget about ever getting that refill. It ain't comin. Actually, when you order a diet coke, expect that not to come either (\""oops, I forgot\"" - Seriously breakfast ain't that hard, honey). You might as well forget your food too. Your dining partner may get theirs, but you'll have to wait 10 more minutes for yours without any type of acknowledgement; I suspect its normal because of the lack of reaction. The hostess' 2 out of our 4 visits acted as server assistants. The other 2, other servers brought our food. (Why are we tipping you, our server, when everyone else does your work?).  The cash register and hostess stand situation can make even the most non-claustrophobic person want to scream out 'stop touching me!' Crowded is an understatement.\n\nThe last time we were in the server ignored us the entire meal, never said a word to us (with the exception of 'what can I get for you?' to take our order), but as she dropped the check tried to start some half-hearted dialogue about 'our plans for the rest of the day' (woman, I don't know you. And after ignoring us, this isn't going to save your tip).\n\nWe'd love to talk to a manager..... but one never seems to hold any presence on the floor. (Is there even one?)"
1,"Food is usually pretty good.   I had the Fish and Chips this time and they suck!  The Chicken sandwich for $5.99 is great if they still have it.  Prices are OK, gets cheaper at night but the selection on the graveyard menu is poor.  I have probably ate here 50 times, yeah, I'll go back again.  Only 2 stars because the fish is terrible, didn't even finish it."
2,"We were here on a Saturday evening around 6:30pm, and we were told that there would be a 30 minute wait. We were okay with that, but as we walked to the bar there were a TON of empty tables!!! Why would there be such a long wait just for two?\n\nAnyway, we found a table at the bar to sit in and have dinner. We shared the mini corn dogs, Dirty Chips, and the bison burger.\n\nThe corn dogs were good. The Dirty Chips were pretty fantastic. It was a huge appetizer for the two of us. Between the corn dogs and chips, we didn't need the bison burger.\n\nThe bison burger was dry. We ordered it medium rare, and it lacked juiciness.\n\nThe service was good and the atmosphere was nice too."
2,"I went here with my wife and kid and have been eating to try it for quite some time. I've been in before with a friend and the smell was divine. We came in and were seated promptly. They had a booster seat for our daughter and were prompted with our order. The service there was very good. The food however was a different story. I ordered the chicken Marsala and my wife got the ravioli's. The ravioli's were good but the presentation was abut tricky. It was on this massive plate covered in marinara and looked like more than it actually was. We ordered a side of the garlic bread which, while it tasted decent, could've been so much better. The cheese on it was a bit bland and it just looked so much better than it actually was. My chicken Marsala which came with spaghetti was not to my liking. Way too much Marsala in the sauce and way to runny. You take a chance with anyones chicken Marsala and this time I lost. All in all it just didn't live up to what I would expect good Chicago pasta to be like. But then again we are in Vegas."
4,OMG Yelpers - thanks so much for your recommendations - we were in Vegas for the weekend and didn't want to eat on the Strip. We drove out to this place for dinner because of all of the Yelp reviews and it was fantastic. Everything was delicious and authentic (and spicy!) and the service was great too. We cannot wait to come back - yay!
4,I love this Home Depot. As a supervisor here transferring in from another store all the associates are friendly and very welcoming.  This team is great. I'm glad to be part of the team... As for any of you shoppers.. Please feel free to seek me out here if you need any assistance!!!
3,"This is definitely the best burger place I've been to so far food-wise, but be warned: don't come here when you're starving because the wait (both for a table and then for the actual food to come) will probably make you faint. \n\nThe feel of Burgr is modern and minimalistic, but spacious and intimate enough. I came here with a group of five friends on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm. We were told that the wait would be about a little over an hour, and we were able to leave a phone number so as to be notified via text when our table was ready. The actual wait was about an hour and a half, but we were seated quickly and our drink and food orders taken soon after. \n\nWe waited ten minutes for our drink orders to come (all of us had just ordered water) and then another HOUR for our food to come. I understand that everything is freshly made and that a lot of care is put into the food, but an hour for six entrees and three sides? After watching Gordon Ramsay's hardcore antics on his shows, I had much different expectations for service in one of his restaurants. When the food did come though, it was definitely just as good as I expected. \n\nChanterelle Burger:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=GQgBbOObWxl4NMnr2AUQNQ#GQgBbOObWxl4NMnr2AUQNQ)\nThis burger was grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with fresh arugula, roasted chanterelles, and a sweet fig jam. All the components were well-cooked and complemented each other well, although I wish there had been more chanterelles (I think there were only two pieces) and that the fig jam was a tad less sweet. \n\nTruffle fries:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=GQgBbOObWxl4NMnr2AUQNQ#vAwykqxeHJ6L9us0hwI6EQ)\nI love that these were thick-cut and fried to a crisp on the outside while still soft and mealy on the inside. They were served with two sauces on the side: one a variation of ketchup and the other a kind of tartar sauce (but with a few added spices I believe). Both were delicious with the piping hot fries. \n\nSweet potato fries:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=GQgBbOObWxl4NMnr2AUQNQ#whOTAAufI9XOoXYwTtCESQ)\nHands down the best sweet potato fries I've ever had, piping hot and topped with heavenly powdered sugar. These also came with a canister of powdered sugar on the side as well as a kind of sweet syrup dip. I wasn't a big fan of the syrup because I felt like it overpowered the delicate flavor of the sweet potato, but I've never had sweet potato fries anywhere else that were sprinkled with powdered sugar, and it was just so ridiculously delicious. \n\nOverall, this was a delicious meal, and I'd absolutely come back for the food. I hope the service won't take as long next time, but I'll come prepared just in case it does."
0,WOW! I normally wouldn't review a gas station but this place is so bad I felt it warranted it. The angle of the lanes is absurd and it seems everyone there is pissed about something.
4,"Killer little sandwich spot. They used to have a deli downtown, but now just do sandwiches and pasts. Fresh bread, killer Italian meats and super fresh veggies! I'm itchin to try some of the pasta dishes they have, but this is THE spot for a rockin Italian sandwich!"
1,"My wife and I were dying to go to Buddy's new place in Vegas. So I made reservations ahead of time and couldn't wait. We went earlier in the day just so we could know where in the mall it was located. I'm glad we did since it was off a corridor from the main forum shops. We liked how the place looked. Well set up and inviting. They had a long row of outside tables in front of the restaurant. \n\nSo we go to the place and they found our reservation and went to seat us. They brought us into the bar and sat us in the corner with a view of the strip. I didn't mind the view but if I made reservations why was I sitting at the bar? Kinda of set the mode already. It was not to crowded for a Friday night which we were very surprised when most restaurants are hopping. There were bread stick on the table already but they were prepackaged ones and not from Italy, they were made in New Jersey. \n\nWe wanted the best from Buddy so my wife ordered his wife's linguine and clam sauce. While I had Buddy's chicken rigatoni \""ALLA VODKA\"". My wife's meal was plain and not worth the $26 that they charged for it. It tasted like my wife made it herself nothing fancy or fantastic taste. Mine had maybe 6 pieces of chicken in it and the pasta was kind of chewy. It was like my wife made it also. Not saying I wouldn't eat it but not real fine dining. We have been to several restaurants in Vegas since we go 4-6 times a year. So I'm no newbie. \n\nOh I missed the garlic bread we ordered before the meal. Which consisted of three pieces for 9. Nothing special and little over priced again. My wife and I agreed Buddy should of opened a caf\u00e9 type restaurant and not fine dining. The food is more family food but over priced for Vegas. It would be totally packed everyday if the prices were lower and family orientated. \n\nBut not to jam on Buddy over his place. We had the Italian birthday cake and let me tell you it was no disappointment. We loved it and that what Buddy is famous for Cakes. I wish he had a bakery with the restaurant because that would go no stop. Hope this helps you guys out. thanks"
2,"I've always like Delux. I don't go that often, but it has always been good.\n\nThe last time I went, wasn't the exception. The burger was pretty good as well as the fries.\n\nThis time I ordered also the beet salad which was barely OK. Nothing in particular but the beets (the flavor and texture) are nonexistent. \n\nThe patio was super dark, I mean, you could have a whole braid of hair in your plate, that you would't see it.\n\nAlso the add sushi in their menu. That gives me the impression that the burgers weren't doing that great. But why sushi instead of improving their flagship dish?\n\nOh well, 3 solid stars. \n\nGo there and get a delux burger, you won't regret."
1,Barely mediocre bar food.  Our beers were warm and the food was blah and greasy.  I've had better food from a fast food joint and at half the price.  Not worthy of a return.
2,Good pizza but can be a little oily/greasy.  \n\nNot really sure what else to say here.
1,"If you like basic bland burgers that you could probably cook yourself by buying those pre-shaped beef patties and slapping them on the grill at home (topped off with your basic condiments on a plain bun), then this is probably your kind of place.  Also, the fries are thin, overly salted, and basic.\n\nI will give props to the shakes, which are very good and thick.\n\nAll told, it's a basic burger joint that so happens to be open at ungodly hours so you can get your post-buzz fix after partying all night.  At least the prices are reasonable..."
2,"I have been there several times over the last six months. No real complaints but not realy any WOWS! either. I enjoy the concept which is one of the main reasons we continue to go back. The \""sliders\"" idea is great especially in large groups. \n\nI had the  waygu, Wild boar and caprese salad on the last visit. The salad was standard so cant complain there. \n\nThe waygu was disappointing because I love Waygu steak but for the price not bad. The boar gave me as well my my friend stomach aches but we had never had it before so that may  be why. \n\nThe white sangria is killer I think I had like four. Its a fun nice clean and contemporary place for a weekend lunch and can pretty much please any kind of eater."
4,"Everything we've tried has been amazing, including the Blind Special. Friendly staff; great decor; one of our favorite places to brunch."
4,"This is exactly what Vegas started out as.  It's what it's supposed to be about. A great live jazz band, beautiful women that are great dancers and a wonderful singer. I would recommend this show to anyone looking for something to see in Vegas."
2,"Decided to try for the first time last night.  Really like the outside seating but bed careful not to sit too close to the air screen; it'll blow on you and your food! There was seven tables at 645pm, a little quiet but we were able to get seated immediately.  Our hostess gave us menus; when asked for a beer -wine menu she said all were being used!  Really? 7 tables!  But our waiter\nLuke brought the menus over right away.  He was vey friendly, attentive and knowledgable, especially when it came to the tap beers.  Great selection.\nIt was half price apps until 7pm so we tried the charcuterie board; nicely presented with three meats and three cheeses, pepperonis, arugula, roasted strips of red bell peppers and slivers of Kalamata olives. Fair amount of food but for $10 at full price I would expect higher quality meats.\nI had the Philly steak sandwich all the way with onion rings and chipotle mayo dipping sauce.  The steak is shaved in house, tender and plentiful but could have used a little seasoning.  Onion rings were made from real onions, not the paste filled style; but my disappointment was the chipotle dipping mayo.  No muy caliente at all!  It tasted like annatto colored mayo; not even a hint of smokiness or heat.\nMy wife had the white pizza; very nicely done.  A short bite at the center and a good chewy crust.  Very NY ish.  \nWe will return again to try other dishes and we wish them success for the future. Definitely a place for a cold draft avid a game.  How about stocking NCs Red Oak?"
2,"Stopped for a bite to eat the food truck rally in South End last evening.  There were  four food trucks at the rally: Herban Legend, a cupcake truck, Goody Woody's (tacos, burritos), and Sticks and Cones (ice cream).  I was told Herban Legend is currently one of Charlotte's most popular food trucks, so I went with them.\n\nThis truck serves sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and hot dogs.  Most items are in the $6-8 range.  Sides run up to $5 each and non-alcoholic beverages are $1 each.  No combos.  Everything's ordered a la carte.  There's a bit of diversity on the menu -- you can get a French dip, like one of my buddies got, a Cuban sandwich, tostada, curry chicken wrap, and fish and chips.\n\nI went with the shawarma, which is an Arab wrap, for $6.50.  This is one of the truck's top sellers.  I've had my fair share of shawarmas and thought Herban Legend's version was OK.  Theirs includes grilled chicken, Greek tzatziki sauce, tabouleh salad (cold minty salad made with bulgur and parsley), chopped tomatoes and french fries wrapped in flat bread.\n\nThe flat bread was grilled so it was hard and brittle.  This caused the wrap to break apart easily once I grabbed the sucker to bite into it.  It was packed with a sufficient amount of ingredients and plenty of sauce, so much so that the sauce was spilling all over the place as I ate.  Overall, it was satisfying, though I'd probably prefer softer bread and it'd be cool if they had some meat options like other shawarma joints offer.\n\nI also ordered a side of Herban's truffle fries, which at $5, is pretty expensive for a side of fries.  They've also got regular fries for $2-3 and honestly, I tried both, and the truffle fries weren't worth the five bucks.  Both styles of fries were alright.  One order of fries is good for 2-3 people.\n\nIf I ever get the chance to revisit this truck, I'll probably order the fried green tomato grilled cheese sandwich.  Someone in our group last night ordered this and she loved it.\n\nBeverage options were limited: Coke, Sprite, and bottled water.  The good thing about food trucks is you can BYOB.\n\nFast and friendly service.  Credit cards are accepted at a 25 cent surcharge.  You sign your receipt on their iPhone and can get the receipt texted or emailed to you."
4,"Great service, lots of tasty options spinach enchiladas were delicious also chips and salsa they give you are great, the green salsa is my favorite! Will be back to try more."
0,"So dissapointing! I ordered the club that claims to be \""piled high\"" with turkey ham lettuce mayo and cranberry sauce... Triple decker style.  I opened my sandwich and thought I had been given the wrong one. It was as tall as a sandwich with only 2 pieces of bread which was the first bad sign considering there was a 3rd piece of bread in there. The turkey was ok but the ham was minuscule and looked like Walmart pressed ham... Yuck! And the lettuce; one little sliver of iceberg. Waste of money!"
1,"I went this this location shopping yesterday on28th.stop by at aldo shoes store because they have a great deal50% off on sale.i saw a  pair of sandal that i really like i ask the guy works there if they have my size and he went in the back and brought it to me but it looks like lots of people tried on it so i asked him if he can order for me online. he looked at me just think am annoying and say \""what they r only about 20bucks\""even i order for u online its gonna all the same theres no guarante.\""\ni feel upset at this time just said thank u and walked away he act like he was not care did not even response you are welcome or have a nice day something like that.\ni mean its not about 20bucks im paying it i wanna get what i wanna or just be nice to your customers."
2,"The pasta was good, the staff was overly friendly but it took a while to get my food since everything is made fresh. I had a sandwich with eggplant, mozz, and tomatoes and the rigatoni special. If you are in a hurry just order the pasta from the window and you should be fine but I didn't. Fairly high priced which is my main reason to rate it 3 stars and the wait time."
2,"Since opentable wouldn't accept my review...seemed good for group (LV for bachelorette party). Party girls would probably choose more modern ambience but was in our hotel & compared to \""in\"" places in Vegas was decently priced although still expensive in our eyes. Host took group pic & printed out right there for free nice surprise! Took a while for waiter to get to us, get orders going, get refills & their antion in general. Be aware they charge extra for \""sharing\"" so be very clear even if you're just putting someone's order on your check. No help for a vegetarian (other reviews said there were options but the waiter said no substitutions and no help) so had to eat only the fried veg app & edamame. Waiter upsells by letting you think things are included & is hard to understand. Show was good though we enjoyed the cook!"
0,Not worth it.
4,We went here for lunch while on vacation.  The food was great and the portions were quite large.  3 of us at for $30 plus tip.
3,"Took my family (8 & 10 year olds) to the exhibit today.  Bought tickets for $22 each via the 1/2 price ticket booth in front of Planet Hollywood.\n\nOur kids are really into the Titanic story due to the movie and cable documentaries, so we took a shot.  \n\nThe exhibit was a good experience overall.  The sights, sounds and even the temperatures made you feel as if you were touring through the ship itself.  The many personal effects of the passengers brought the real story to life.  \n\nThe grand staircase was quite a site and we bought a family photo of it for $20.  (We very rarely do this but liked the shot.  They allegedly email you a digital copy as well.  Amazingly the lady said it takes 3-5 days.  Quite odd for 2014 email.)\n\nThe stop , which took about an hour, was a nice family activity in a city not really known for them.  $88 was a tad steep, but not terrible either.  I'm rating it 4 stars because I feel the exhibit could have had more to see. What was there was interesting but I wish there had been more of it.  \n\nOverall pleased with the exhibit!"
2,The food is good. Margarita is good but a bit weak. Getting something better than the house may be different. All together a good experience.
4,"My partner and I received excellent treatments from Kathy and Yolanda. Next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be returning for Kathy's strong and skilled deep tissue massage. We both felt our bodies reset after our massages with her - and we agree it was one of our best massages ever. Yolanda was also a wonderful pedicurist - very warm personality and quick, efficient work. Definitely recommend these two folks and the Well Spa!"
0,"Being from NY, I have some high expectations for my Chinese fare. This place misses the mark...by a mile. The sesame chicken was essentially glazed pieces of fried something, the wonton soup was salt water, and the best thing was the egg roll which could have come from costco. I rarely give bad reviews, especially for places that I love so close to, but I can't get around this one.\n\nOverall, skip this place."
0,Terrible service and terrible drinks!! Will NEVER go back!! Total waste of $200!! Ugh!!
4,Best pizza in Anthem by far! Actually the best pizza I have found in phoenix so far.  This particular Barros has way better pizza than some of the other Barros in the valley. ..not sure why but it is worth driving to this one if you want a great pizza.  The prices are awesome too.  Great value! Large 2 topping for under $10 it's a steal.  Way better than a $20 pizza at a major chain.
0,"The thunderstorms should've been a foretelling of what was to come.....\n\nWe have been to the location in Downtown Disney (and everything Disney is always uber-organized), so we figured why not, and came here with our nieces that we were watching for the day/night and little one while staying at the Signature. \n\nYou'd think that since this place is supposed to be about the experience and appeal to children that the kids would've had a blast. \n\nI should start off by saying that I called down to make a reservation from our Suite, and was hung up on twice within the phone actually picking up on the 7th ring!! Finally called down to our Concierge and mentioned we were unsuccessful for the last 10 minutes (I waited to call twice more hoping it was an \""accident\"" - I know glutton for punishment, but those who know me know I am a huge pushover and ALWAYS think that there are such things as 5th chances....). \n\nAfter confirming a reservation with the concierge, they called back to say that the Cafe said we would have to wait 2 hours for a reservation, but if we wanted to head down now that we'd be able to get seated right away...????? \n\nSo we headed down 2 hours later, just because the girls we're just too into the Lazy River. :)\n\nWhen we got there - the condescending hostess asked me, and OVER enunciated every syllable:\n\"" I AM SORRY - DO YOU KNOW IF YOU ACTUALLY MADE THE RES-ER-VA-TION FOR TODAY? OR A DIFFERENT DAY? DO YOU UNDERSTAND?\"" \n\nI blinked back in disbelief considering at 2 pm, half the restaurant was empty, and there wasn't even a line in the walk in area. \n\nSo I fired back with:\n\n\""Yes, Indeed I understand what you are saying. The reservation is at 2, I called your line from our OWNERS suite in the Signature and was hung up on...\n\n\""interrupted with - oh we're very busy - so that tends to happen\""\n\n\""NOT that that is acceptable, but I had our personal concierge call down for a reservation from the Signature - does that perhaps refresh your memory?\""\n\n\""She said, well, I'll see what I can do\""\n\nWTF ? Who the F treats people that way? You're not freaking Craftsteak or any of the fine dining establishments in the building, and we're not random idiots who wandered off the street.\n\nSo back with the person who thinks that I don't understand her English vernacular, or that I am said random Idiot - we will find something for you but how many children do you have. \n\n4, plus 2 adults, and one of the children needs a highchair. \n\nOK I didn't ask about the high chair, I want to know how many children - can you tell me that?\n\nOK - 4 children, 2 adults I said through a gritted teeth and a smile. After all, the kids are the ones who said they wanted to come here because their friends thought this was such a cool place. \n\nThe entire process to get to our table was like this. \n\nThe only consolation was that the guy who actually seated is was an older gentleman, very pleasant, and when he saw that within a few minutes of us being seated that we were going to have to encounter the wild Elephants bellowing in our faces within less than a foot, he volunteered to move us elsewhere - we gladly obliged. \n\nOur almost 2 year old, and the 7 and 10 year old nieces literally jumped every time the storm started because the elephants trunk would \""toot\"" in their direction and shriek whenever a thunderstorm came. Not amusing. \n\nIt took that long for the same cocky hostess to find us a table in a near  half empty restaurant. I think that is her way of trying to f with people with her \""perceived power\"".\n\nGood thing it usually takes us about that long to get the kittens in a box and figure out who wants what off the menu. \n\nThe server was nice enough at first.\n\nThen we had to remind him to bring 2 of our drinks, and oyster crackers for the 2 bowls of Clam Chowder. He brought them eventually, after the soup was half way finished. \n\nThe food is TGIF with a twist on the name of the entrees. Like the Rumble in The Jungle Turkey Wrap. Wild Turkey in a Jungle? That should only come in a bottle.... VERY unexciting food really - except for my coconut shrimp = I only had one. Everyone else at the table had one off my plate. Should say something about the quality of the other food. \np.s. WHO THE F charges 10 bucks for a kids Macaroni and small portion of bread? \n\nAt the end of the meal, he did end up bringing our bill to us once he saw the kiddies were done eating. \n\nAfter telling him to charge it to our suite - he proceeded to give me the bill to sign, and mention that if we wanted to leave him a tip that we could do so at the bottom. \n\nGood thing I looked at all the receipts included and noticed the only one that listed the 17% service charge that was already added, was on the receipt he was going to keep for himself.\n\nToo bad, no half stars - that would've gone to the older gentleman who really tried to be accommodating. \n\nThough we like the Restaurant Row available at the MGM/Signature - this place really takes the fun and convenience out of it."
2,"I was excited to try Pho here since they opened after hearing about it and passing by after it opened, the Yelp reviews were promising as well! I went with fellow Yelper Heather S. as we were in the mood for hot soup on that cold night! \n\nThe decor is nice, bright and clean and I like the open view kitchen so that you can see the cooks moving about while making every ones food. \n\nI was in the mood for something with shrimp in it and for Pho there were only two options for seafood. They had the seafood Pho which had, shrimp, scallops and imitation crab or Tom Pho which is what I ordered that only had shrimp.\n\nThe Pho noodles and the broth were good however my little shrimps had been cooked to death, overcooked then filled in a bowl with boiling hot water just killed it as those shrimps never had a chance to be good. That is a pet peeve of mine, over cooked seafood is a deal breaker and will ruin a meal as shrimp should not be hard as a rock and chewy. I do not suggest ordering the Tom Pho.\n\nI did like the fresh spring rolls with the peanut dipping sauce and my lychee flavored iced tea was a winner.\n\nIf you do not see a combination that is listed you do have the option to create your own up to three meats.\n\nThere is no ATM in this restaurant, they refer you across the street of crazy busy spring mountain to a Wells Fargo bank ATM. I have no idea why previous reviews state there is an ATM located inside of the restaurant when there is not. \n\nAlso no credit card transactions are accepted for less than 20.00 so it made it sort of complicated for us going dutch."
0,Walked in and ignored by both the bar tender and the server. When we got the server's attention and asked to be seated it seemed like we were interrupting her. \n\nWe walked....
3,"It's early November and I just returned from a 6 day getaway with my wife.  We selected this hotel after reading several reviews from past guests.  When we arrived we were greeted by the parking attendant who offered their assistance with true interest and not the -- I want a tip attitude.  FYI, self parking is not an option at the Platinum and quite frankly for a couple of bucks here and there, well worth it.  Checking in was a breeze with the same \""how can we help your stay more enjoyable\"" attitude from the staff behind the counter.  This theme by hotel staff carried on throughout our stay.  Our reservations placed us on the 9th floor looking towards the strip.  The view from our room was OK at best because you are looking out over an old large vacant parking lot and towards the back of the casinos on the strip.  At night the view was much better due to the lights.  Opening our room door, you enter into the kitchen which is a full kitchen to include, fridge, stove, dishwasher, plates, glasses, etc...  What was not in the room but we soon requested were pots and pans.  We choose to make breakfast in the AM when we got up.  A bit different having a full kitchen with no cook ware, but no biggie we just called down and they gleefully sent up anything we needed.  It also includes things like dish washing soap, sponge, etc...  The kitchen counter was granite and it separated the kitchen from the living room.  The living room was also quite large which included a large flat screen TV with a sleeper sofa couch, coffee table, etc...  There is a sliding door leading to the balcony that looks towards the strip that has a table and a few chairs for sitting.  Located in a separate closet off of the kitchen/living room are the clothes washer and dryer .  It too includes the all the necessities needed for washing your clothes.  The little things like no need to get soap, sponges, detergent, fabric softener, etc... speaks volumes in being a customer service oriented facility.  I say facility versus hotel because from what I gather, some units are owned by permanent residents and others are rented like you would experience in a typical hotel encounter.  Enough of that, back to the details.  Off of the living room is a door leading to the bedroom.  The bedroom is very spacious and the bed was very comfortable.  Not some cheesy worn out mattress but a seemingly new firm mattress.  There are the typical night stands, lights, clock radio, and chairs adjacent to the bed.  The bedroom has a clothes closet with a safety deposit box.  We didn't use it but it's there for your convenience.  There's a large window that also overlooks towards the strip.  Off of the bedroom is the bathroom that comes with a large tiled shower, a large Jacuzzi tub for two, a double bowl sink, and another clothes closet that has its own hangers.  There are two doors into the bathroom, one from the bedroom and another off of the kitchen.\n\nThe hotel has a inviting restaurant/bar on the first floor that was warm and comfortable.  We ordered drinks and had a few appetizers only once during our stay.  The drinks were fine but we did complain about the shrimp ceviche they offer.  I'm a bit picky on ceviche so if you are you too, you'll be disappointed.  To their credit they were apologetic and immediately took it off our bar tab.\n\nLocated on the fifth floor is an indoor/outdoor pool with a medium sized outdoor hot tub adjacent to the outside portion of the pool.  The temperature in November was in the upper 50's/60's.  The pool has its own towels so there is no need to bring one from your room.  There is no life guard on duty so be cautious with little children.  There is plenty of comfortable seating available.  The temperature of the water was very relaxing and I'm not a cold water lover so you gauge.\n\nAll in all I would highly recommend this place and return again.  Keep in mind this is a NON-gambling hotel so if that is what you want you'll need to walk/drive to the strip for that or find another place to stay.  The hotel is located on Flamingo Rd. and the walk to Las Vegas Blvd. takes about 5 min.  From there your right smack dab in the middle of things.\n\nNow for the bad.  The view from our room was OK.  There weren't enough towels in the room.  There were three sets.  I never asked for more but I'm sure based on past experiences they would gladly provide more.  That's it.....\n\np.s.\n\nThe cost of the room including tax was about:\n$230 on Friday and Saturday nights\n$170 on Monday, Tuesday, wednesday\n\nEnjoy....."
2,"Out of the four major malls here (Galleria, Meadows, Fashion Show), this is my least favorite. But there are some saving graces: Old Navy, Yankee Candle, the Pet Store, some promotions if you join the e-club. And I almost forgot Marshall's- just outside of the old Dillard's location.\n\nThere are a lot of empty store space up for lease.One wing looks pretty depressing. Once, with my husband, I counted about 25 empty slots! We went again this I don't think that count includes the food court. **UPDATE 7/24/10- part of the mall where a lot of the stores vacated, has been officially closed off, after Frederick's, making that wing feel even smaller (kinda like an Alice in Wonderland feeling) and more depressing, for that matter. At least, we actually went shopping here at several different stores- Game Stop, FYE, Macy's, and Old Navy. Sadly, the Pet Store closed! The McDonald's is still closed at the food court. Now, the other half is closed, due to renovations.\n\nIt's pretty crowded on Black Friday due to the department store sales and promotions. My last few trips here were pretty quick- a few stores and I was out of there. It's convenient if you're doing some shopping in the area- lots of shopping in the surrounding strip malls on Maryland Parkway."
3,"If you don't mind staying a little further from the strip, then this is the place to stay! It's not going to give you that luxury hotel experience that you'd get from staying at some of the hotels in Vegas, but I was very happy with the experience.\n\nI went with a group of friends to Vegas a couple months ago, so we booked two suites for all of us for 3 nights. Each suite had a full kitchen, washer and dryer, two bedrooms (one with a king-sized bed [with a Jacuzzi!!] and the other with two queen-sized beds), and a nice living room with a flat screen tv, couch, chairs, and a dining table. It definitely had a very comfortable, home-y feel to it. Everything was clean and there were plenty of extra towels in the bathrooms. \n\nThey also had a nice pool to relax and do some swimming. No glass allowed by the pool, but Solo cups are fine for drinks, if you know what I mean. ;) The pool is no Encore Beach Club by any means, but it's quiet and relaxing if you want to tan and doze off for a bit. :) \n\nI would definitely stay there again if we go back. My only complaint would be that they didn't have one of our suites ready by the time we checked in, and one of the doors to the bathroom had a huge hole in it, but Customer Service was really helpful in recording the damage and not charging us for it."
2,It's hard to get pasta wrong. Its also hard to stick out. Babbo does neither. A distinctly average yet affordable dining option located north of the 101 loop. They have lunch specials and decent pizza and wine.
3,"What a wonderful dinner!  My wife and I arrived in Las Vegas at our condo late afternoon and decided to go somewhere close...Steiners was close.  I explained my dietary restrictions to our waiter and came up with an idea not on the menu: a chicken dinner plate.  Chicken breast was wonderful; moist, seasoned just right, steamed veggies and plain mashed potatoes.  Everything was delicious.\n\nWe arrived at Happy Hour and got 2 beers for the price of 1; you've got to love Foster's on tap!\n\nMy wife ordered their version of a French Dip sandwich.  She said it was a bit dry, but ordered it with the onion rings (for an additional charge).    Yummy rings.\n\nWait staff was wonderful.  At least 4 different servers were at our table at one time or the other making sure everything was good and bringing what we needed.  Merited a 20% tip on my \""very good service\"" meter.\n\nWe will be back before the vacation is over."
4,"Im not a big fan of the food, but the dessert is great!   You can't go wrong!  Melted chocolate with tons of stuff to dip it in, how could it get better?!  They have great dark chocolate fondue, with excellent dipper things (bananas, cheesecake, strawberries, brownie bits, marshmellows, etc.)  \n\nThis is a great drinks/dessert place that i would recommend! :]  Enjoy!"
3,"After reading the reviews for this place, I decided that it was worth trying as we were checking out The Venetian anyway. I got the Kobe burger which was really good! The meat was nice and juicy and the fries were crispy and crunchy. This came with shittake mushrooms, caramelized onions, and a side of togarashi aioli. The BF got the Italian grinder which I had a bite of, and it was really good as well!\n\nPrices are about $12-$15 average for entrees, which I think is a good price for the food and relatively quick service considering how busy it was."
1,"The stm is a great way to get around Montreal. Fares are reasonable and have many options for locals and tourists. \n\nFares can be bought at opus machines in metro stations or some retailers such as jean coutou or pharmaprix.\n\nOne thing I dislike about Stm is their front line staff... Don't get me wrong there are some great staff at the stm but the majority of them just stink! I remember one time I was on the route 51 bus and asked the driver nicely for directions in my broken french, the lady who was driving the bus asked me \""do I speak French?\"" I replied \""a little\"" and she says \""well I do not speak english\"" and gave me a disgusted stare and started muttering something in French... I was like WTF??? \n\nI would of gave Stm 4 stars if the staff provided better customer service."
4,I recently bought a vehicle from this dealership and I have to admit it was the best car dealership experence i've ever had!!!! Not only was the staff pleasant and knowledgeable but they we very helpful and got me in and out in my new car. At first I pulled into this dealership and I was confused because they don't have a front lot like I expected. They keep all there cars in an indoor warehouse! The car was spotless clean and it ran and still runs great. They put brand new tires on it too! You will not find another dealership like this one. Take a walk around their warehouse and u'll notice every car looks brand new. Ive already reccomended them to family and friends and now to who ever reads this article. GET DOWN TO EAUTONICHE I PROMISE YOU'LL LEAVE WITH A SMILE!
2,"We haven't found many lively places to have dinner on a Sunday night in AZ.  So we usually end up at Kabuki in Tempe Market Place.  Last Sunday, we ended up in Tempe Market Place again but didn't feel like sushi so we decided to go here.\n\nFor a sports bar, this place is surprisingly nice inside.  We were seated in one of the booth with huge screen, we ordered our food, and the order didn't take long to get to our table.\n\n*Spinach and mushroom quesadilla - pretty yummy.  it wasn't oily at all\n*Black N Blue - it was....interesting but a little too weird...the gravy was a little burnt and you really, truly have to love blue cheese.\n*Grilled Pastrami Sliders - pretty good.  again, it wasn't oil or dry.\n\n*Location = very lively\n*Decor = cool for a sports bar\n*Food = ok\n*Price = a little on a high end for a sports bar"
2,"Before there were a lot of independent coffeehouses in Las Vegas (i.e., 7 years ago or so), places like Palio were the only refuge from Starbucks or other corporate coffee chains. What makes Palio interesting still today is that yes, it's in the Bellagio and so it's a Strip property, but it still manages to pull off great coffee and pastries, has a pretty cool European vibe and it's one place where service has always been good even though probably 95% of its guests are one-time visitors and not often very well-behaved.\n\nThe theme is Italian (Renaissance) and so the decor, pastries, gelato and of course coffee offerings all reflect that. Bold espresso, perfectly-foamed cappuccino and strong drip brews never disappoint and are served in a style that reminds you of Europe (until you turn around and bump into some wayward, lone tourist who's plopped itself down and claimed a 4-seat table without ordering anything, but I digress...) \n\nSeriously, the coffee's great and service is well-done. This place is also a pretty good date spot - try the eclairs, Napoleons or millefeuille along with that latte macchiato! - as long as you make sure not to go during high-traffic times. If you can snag one of the few tables near the windows, you can get a view of the Bellagio pool area with its trees and cabanas. \n\n3 stars overall, because it's a little cramped and when it's really busy, many tourists act \u00fcber-entitled, pushing in front of you or blocking out table space or hovering around the creamer/sugar area for no reason. Plus, the coffee and pastries are a bit expensive and hard to justify at the price...until you remember you are on the Strip. Besides, it's well situated near the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, not on the main casino floor and somewhere that you can easily grab a coffee and for a few moments forget where you are. And unlike some other places on the Strip, what brings you back to reality is not the often-typical \""OK, whatever\"" service ethic, but tourist behavior."
0,"I'm new to town and I picked this place because of the good reviews. The first time I went I had gel polish, but it came already chipping off after 7 days! I never had that experience before. Gel polish easily last 3 weeks and usually only has to be replaced because it grows out. Also, they don't have the same brand nail polish that they use for gel polish, so for your toe nails, you have to pick a color that comes close, but you see always a difference, especially once it's on your nails. I decided to give them another chance and went  back after three weeks, and when they took off the nail polish on my toe nails, I saw I had fungus! They reassured me it was 'normal'.  Then I had the manicure, the girl that helped me cut in my cuticles, leaving an ugly scab on my finger. Nail salons are all over the place, so there is really no need to go back here."
4,"This is the best Mexican food I have ever tasted. I know that's not saying much at all since I hail from NYC, but bear with me.\n\nThe tacos run you 2 dollars and are stuffed with meat, guacamole, salsas, onions, cilantro, and so much ugh. I ate about 6 - tongue, beef head, spicy pork, tripe (THE BEST!), carne asada, beef shoulder. They were all good, except maybe the beef shoulder because it reminded me too much of my homestyle Russian food. The tripe was the star though, with the intestines fried to a crunchy yet still a bit chewy perfection. In addition to the tacos, I also tried a carne asada quesadilla. My only knowledge of quesadillas being those flattened, depressing (yet still delicious) things in Taco Bell, I was mindblown. Everything had such a great flavor and texture.\n\nThey serve grilled peppers and scallions on the side for free, which have a great flavor. Also on the side for you to grab at your leisure are radishes and lime pieces. Mexican fountain sodas are also available but I didn't like any of the flavors, and was upset that they didn't have Jarritos.\n\nNext time I come back to Vegas, I'm definitely eating here again, and saying hi to my Mexican bro with whom I conversed in my rudimentary Spanish."
4,Un de mes endroits pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al pour relaxer avec une bi\u00e8re et un plat de tapas. Tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able.
4,"My co-workers and I will go here for lunch when we feel like being piggies. I have yet to go for dinner but I'm sure it's just as good!\n\nI typically get the 22 oz lunch cut prime rib, comes with choice of creamed spinach or creamed corn, mashed potatoes w/ gravy, and like a really small salad bar. IF you even have room for the salad bar you are a champion.  I think the meal is like $25 and it's super quick b/c everything is already made. You can be in and out of here in like 40 mins flat.\n\nThe service here is exceptional [like you can't even carry your own plates around the waiters will do that for you] to the hostess who is overly friendly and cheery."
0,"Roberto's\n\nCall me crazy, but when you don't get what you order, at all, get something cold, get a cold shoulder from the staff and get a confrontation with the wanna-be wise guy owner (grandson of the founder, who is more interested in having his picture on the labels of product that they sell in the restaurant and lower level gillateria and charcuterie), I would warn anyone off from this wildly overpriced, poor excuse for an Italian restaurant.\n\nThe evening started our simply enough, with my friend and frequent patron if this restaurant recommending it for a gathering of our party of eight. It was my fianc\u00e9e's birthday and we figured that a more upscale establishment with finer food selections and a more creative menu was in order.\n\nThe service at first was slow, but the place was busy and we had a great group of people around the table (near the bathroom I might add, which I hadn't noticed until the attitude of the owner, with his slicked back hair and \""in your face style\"" made it abundantly clear that he didn't care a bit about his clients, only about his appearance and cash in his pocket). My first sign that this attitude carried down to his staff was when I asked if the lasagna (the server noted that she ate the traditional version with meat in a ragout and loved it) for $9 was the same as the one for $18. Later in the evening, as I ate the $18 joke, that was cold, I realized that this pushing was strictly to bump up the bill. This poor excuse for an upscale restaurant can't justify $18 for a piece of lasagna with some strips of veal in it. \n\nWe made it clear, upon ordering that one dish, the shrimp fra diavolo, if it was too spicy, would be desired at a lower heat level, but when the server noted it wasn't too spicy, we said fine, leave it as is. That's when the headaches started (heaven forbid I complain about the lasagna being cold, or not up to snuff for $18). The dishes were delivered, a veal parmigiana, a family sized pasta in rose (vodka sauce), a salmon and a couple of other non-descript dishes. \n\nThe penne al vodka was priced at $30 and was no larger than a regular portion (unless dining in a nouvelle cuisine style restaurant of the 80's) and barely satisfied. At $15 it might have been more reasonable and it was also cold. \n\nThe veal was nothing special, the spaghetti was topped with a simple tomato sauce and the veal slathered in cheese. Any New York diner would do a better job for about $14 not upwards of $20. I've already talked about my lasagna, the salmon was overcooked and expensive and the damage started when my fianc\u00e9e received her dish that was a seafood pasta, not the shrimp dish. When the dish arrived, I tried a shrimp, my eldest tried two and my fianc\u00e9e asked to have the dish returned because it wasn't spicy at all and we were almost all done. The server protested slightly, but agreed to take it back and offered to take it off the bill when we said we didn't want anything else. We were looking forward to leaving the restaurant and going downstairs for ice cream and desert, when the server came back to inform us that the owner, the wanna-be, was not removing the imposter of a shrimp fra diavolo from the bill. \n\nThis after the marginal penne, the cold lasagna, the middling veal and slow service. My fiancee, not wanting to cause a scene, but expecting some level of professionalism and food quality for the astronomical prices, got up to speak to the owner. He immediately postured and shot back at my fiancee that she didn't know what she was talking about, too bad and \""what do you want me to do?\"" as if he was looking for a fight. I couldn't believe my eyes and ears and she was almost in tears. This for over $200 with tips!\n\nHe finally relented and we couldn't get out of there fast enough, my friend embarrased as he frequented Roberto's quite a bit and told me he was shocked and wouldn't come back. I just wanted my girls to have desert, so on the way out, the obnoxious, arrogant, idiot of an owner said with a smile, as if taunting us, \""thanks for visiting\"", like a poor cartoon of a restaurant owner. I replied \""I'm not so sure\"" and he said in response, \""I'm not so sure!\"" as if looking to get into an altercation. I just sucked it up and left, but couldn't believe the attitude of this poor excuse for an owner, maitre-D or otherwise. He should be fired by his grandfather just for that response, not to mention the over-priced, poor quality, cold food. Don't waste your time or money, when there are so many other exceptional restaurants in the same area, at lower cost and with staff and owners who care about their businesses. This guy is remedial at best and should go back to restaurant school..."
1,"We are frequent visitors of Vegas and like to try new places, well what a disappointment this was, the place when you walk in looks very nice, ambience is great, definitely looks like a high end place, until you see that all servers are wearing plaid shirts, jeans, shorts, etc... Basically they have no dress code which was a total shocker. We sat down, looked at the menu, ordered a few different things , 1 was the tartar, which came with a raw quail egg and it was blahhhhh... I had to return it, mind u there was a new person coming up each time, so we didn't know who exactly we were looking for when we needed something, the sushi definitely was not impressive and we left disappointed and hungry, and paid over $200, for a price like that I expect much more. Definitely will not return there again!"
4,Buttters never disappoints!! Their food is amazing. They also have fantastic gluten free pancakes and waffles!
3,"Went for Sunday brunch (around noon) and were all pleasantly surprised!  \n\nThe service was great -- you get your own pitcher of water and carafe of coffee.  The coffee was deeeelicious.  \n\nI made the mistake of ordering a tall stack of pancakes.  They were HUGE.  Honestly, all you need is a short stack -- they were at least 8 inches across.  The sausage were slightly overcooked, but still really good.\n\nAnother in our group had an omelette and we weren't overly impressed with it -- she commented she could have gotten a bigger omelette at IHOP (and probably better looking).  \n\nBut overall, I'd go back.  Those pancakes were delicious, as was the coffee.  Very good."
3,"When you are hungry at an airport - I find myself looking at the lines. Instead of going to the popular perhaps best place - I find myself going to the place with the shortest line and most of the time it isn't because they are the quickest servers.\n\nHowever, this place was actually different. It had a short line - it was quick on service and the food was exceptionally good for what it was. I wouldn't want to live off the food, but those fries - how do they do that - they were GREAT!\n\nThe value wasn't there though - and that's the problem with some of these food places at the airport. It isn't a 5 star restaurant, but they charge as if they were and that's a big turn off. However, if you are hungry and want something good and fast - check this place out for sure!"
0,"I took my Playstation 3 here after the laser stopped reading any of the blu-ray discs. When I got it back the PS3 could read the blu-ray, but the power button was indented into the PS3 case. I took it back to them and they said it wasn't them and they didn't do it, however, I haven't touched it since I got it from them. They wanted a receipt to prove that I went there to get it fixed before. They had saved their own copy of the receipt, but when the guy took out the receipts he had he looked through the first few then went on to the next set, not making sure to check all of the receipts. I found my receipt later, and gave it to them, then the guy told me he would replace it and said it would be ready in a few days. When I picked it up again, they didn't charge me anything for it, but after playing a blu-ray, a few days after, the PS3 wouldn't accept blu-rays anymore. I decided I didn't want to go through the hassle of trying to get them to fix it again, so I won't come back here and I'll just save the $120 they would charge and put it towards a new system."
4,"Paper Skyscraper is a fantastic and fun store. They have a little bit of everything. Everyone that works there are always so helpful and nice. This is a store that when my friends come from out of town, we always take them to shop here. Everyone loves it!"
3,"Five stars for food and three stars for prices. I love the Ruebens (yes, they have multiple kinds of them)! I am not so much in love with the price tag. Rueben with drink, tax, and tip comes in around $15. \n\nThat said, I have eaten at Chompie's around 30 times. I really do like the service and the food. Would recommend for others."
2,"Service at the boulangerie/patisserie is almost always attentive, and eight times out of ten, they're more than willing to offer free samples (as opposed to my asking to sample something and my receiving an eager \""yes, of course!,\"" or a stare that says \""I'm too busy to stop and acknowledge your request\"").  I'd give four stars in an instant if it weren't for the fact that every time I show up with a gift certificate to use (my employer issues out gift certs to Basha's every year for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas!), it's guaranteed that the transaction will take anywhere from ten to thirty minutes (or more) and at least one or more coworkers' aid.  Armed with this fact, I always make sure I have extra free time before shopping at an AJ's.\n\nIt's best to call early in the morning before 10:30/11 to catch the baker on site if you have any food concerns.  While some of the baked sweet goods are made from scratch, most are from \""proprietary\"" mixes.  On my last visit, I opted to buy a \""red velvet muffin with chocolate chips\"" without sampling it first, since the nice, young man behind the counter didn't immediately say yes to sampling the baked item (though he did offer to let me try any of the flavored coffees, if I wanted).  It turned out that the sign was wrong, and the muffin did not contain any chocolate chips.  FYI, the muffins here are made from a boxed mix, or so I was told by an older employee behind the counter, who seemed too busy to stop and help, much less greet anyone \""hello.\""  I returned the goods and asked for a refund.\n\nDrip black coffee was OK, and it's always nice to see locally-made chocolates on display..."
2,"Solid burrito spot at very reasonable prices, especially at happy hour ($1 tacos and $2 beers...felt like being back in college). The potato tacos are indeed quite interesting, so be sure to try at least one. Service was above average. Overall, nothing blew me away but I absolutely left full and happy and with hardly a dent in my wallet."
2,"Went around New Year's,  great location and hours. Good looking menu, next time I'm trying the duck bacon burger. The truffle fries are delicious,  I enjoyed the aioli but not the ketchup.  My fianc\u00e9e was first hesitant of the ketchup but at the end raved about it. I just got the regular burger and it was pretty good. I will go again on next visit.  Reason for three stars my waiter never checked on us until it was check time."
0,"I was seriously disappointed after I stopped here last night.  Both flavors of frozen yogurt  were filled with ice crystals, and were very bland. The staff was indifferent, almost to the point of surly, even though I was the only customer at the time.  I walked in with a smile, expecting something nice, but I can say I won't be back."
1,I only went here because my normal breakfast spots were really busy. Found the staff fairly rude and not very helpful. The food was overpriced for what it was. Coffee was bad restaurant coffee (brown water). There are much better breakfast options in town. I will likely not eat here again.
3,QT-Best gas station eva!
4,"yep, good ol' simple home cooking, and by 'home cooking' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving.\n\nif you've never gone, don't be scared off by all the butter references, it's not that bad. the place is teeny tiny, and our table of two had to wait about 10 minutes for a place, parties of more than four, you'll probably have to get split up. \n\nthe omelettes are wonderful, and the rosemary home fries are too good. the bacon is so good.. i can't even describe it. let me stress i am NOT a pork fan, and rarely eat it. i never eat bacon from a restaurant since i'm so picky about it. everyone raved about it here, so i dived in and thought, 'what have i been missing my whole life?' ha ha, yeah, i has an awakening of pork love right in the middle of the joint! seriously, it's unbelievable.\nit's worth the trek no matter where you're coming from, especially on a sat morning. afterward we checked out a small famer's market that was going on right up the street, and then popped in Circles records and tapes, also within walking distance.\n\n***Update 3/8\nI just went over the weekend and we waited more than 45 minutes. i was ok with it, but i was with someone who does not really place value on waiting a little longer for great food, which kind of put a damper on things. def do not bring someone here who is not willing to wait for a good thing."
2,"This location is always busy and unkempt and dirty.  I usually plan to wait for 15 minutes when I go here.  It's also very hard to find, so familiarize yourself with a map (or use google maps every time like I do) \n\nI try to use the location on Scottsdale & Williams as much as possible for an overall better experience.  It's located here:\n\n7339 E Williams Dr\nScottsdale, AZ 85255"
2,"Holy cow. Talk about needing to increase staffing. So I walk in and there's two people in the waiting room, this should go quick right ? Well I get told there is an hour wait. Well I'm already here, might as well wait. Hour goes by and were through both people in front of me and I continue just to sit there. They don't do appointments. So this is really the only choice. I would go elsewhere in the future. Extra star is because it is a nice area that is kept clean. The staff did acknowledge the longer wait time and apologized, which means a lot to me."
0,"WoW,  one star! Those are very rare for me, but here's why. The place its still looks really good and feel about it. The waiters are ill-trained. I came here with a groupon/google offer. I've always wanted to see what it is all about. I am so thankful that I was only out a few bucks and didn't have to pay full price. They screwed up my bill and took FOREVER to fix. Had to get the manager, who was very nice but about as incompetent as the serving staff. The food is very bland, the customer service is NOT horrible, but as bland as the food. Good news, I got my bill fixed after having to get in the manager involved and after a really long wait. With so many places in the vicinity don't waste your time or your money."
1,"Nach langer Zeit war ich Mittags mal wieder in der Karlsruher Filiale der amerikanischen Pizza-H\u00fctte. Bestellt hatte ich das Pasta-Mittagsmen\u00fc. Bei freier Auswahl von Pasta und So\u00dfe w\u00e4hlte ich Spaghetti Carbonara. Kostenpunkt mit 0,3 Pepsi relativ g\u00fcnstige 5,90 Euro.\n\n\n Die al dente gekochten Spaghetti wurden mit relativ viel heller So\u00dfe serviert.

2,"The bread is pretty good. The Italian bake was too watery for my taste. The meat balls were decent and the sausage was ok. A fairly inexpensive meal and you get what you pay for. The crayons and paper tablecloth are a nice touch, nothing better than a paper cut at dinner."
1,"Dined on Friday, 2/22/13. My wife and I recently moved to the Phoenix area from Chicago and I really had no idea about where to dine. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to dine at least at a 4 star restaurant- so I came to Yelp for advice.\n\nOur reservation was 8:15pm and we arrived at 7:55pm. We were invited to sit in the lounge area, which we did, and I expected to do so since we were so early.  We sat in the lounge for about 10 mins and were not approached by a server. In fact, I thought there were no servers since I saw none on the floor so I went to the bar and ordered myself, just like I would at a Chicago neighborhood bar. (Irk#1)Drinks were good and strong, but REALLY pricey- $26 for 2 drinks.\n\nAround 8:30pm, we went back to the hostess desk as no one came to get us for our reservation yet, (they said they would find us in the lounge). We were told our table still wasn't ready and to wait by the fireplace. I was a little peeved now and Iwould have expected to wait if I was late- but we were sufficiently on time I thought. \n\nWe were seated after waiting another 5 mins or so. (8:45pm-30 mins late)(Irk#2) The wait staff, I thought, were pretty good overall. They did a lot of table \""hopping\"", i.e. covered each other's tables, so diners were well taken care of yet not too pushy or chatty.\n\nWe both ordered the lobster bisque soup. I ordered the halibut and my wife ordered the scallops. Bread was not brought to the table until after we ordered dinner- which was 10 mins after we were seated. (irk #3) The sourdough bread was excellent. The focaccia bread was kind of bland and dry. There were 3 dipping sides offered with the bread, which were very good. \n\nLobster bisque was quite delicious. They put this \""hydroponically infused\"" basil seasoning on top of the soup that was very good. I thought the soup was a little overcooked (sitting in the pot too long taste) but still good. My dinner arrived hot and the halibut was bland and little overcooked. (pan-fried). I asked for 2 more pieces of the sourdough bread to eat with my dinner and we were told they were \""out\"" of sourdough. (irk#4). Friday night dinner service and out of bread? Really? My wife's scallops were cool as well as her vegetable sides on the plate. (irk #5)The waiter didn't check on us until 10 mins after the dinner was serves (irk#6) so it wasn't feasible to send it back to get reheated. The waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble, at least.\n\nThe last irk (#7) was that we asked for a bag to put our left-over take home boxes in- 3 total boxes. The waiter said they \""were out of bags\"". He checked twice and the 3rd time brought us a Home Depot bag. I asked if he went to his car to get it. How difficult would it have been for the restaurant manager to go down to the gift shop and grab a couple of dozen bags? \n\nMaybe my expectations are too high since I'm from Chicago(?), but when  a restaurant is rated 5 stars by all of you Yelpers, I expect a little better service when dropping a couple of hundred bucks. Other than the view and the ambiance- I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."
0,"the place looks great. it was a nice atmosphere to chill and relax in. HOWEVER, the service was the worst ive had in a very very long time. The hostess seated us on the outdoor section, took our first drink order, and set us up with our hookah which was awesome, but that was the end of it. we didnt get a waitress until i approached the hostess who originally seated us and asked us if we would be getting a waitress. at that point our drinks had been empty 20 minutes. the waitress then came over took our drink order and it took her another 15 minutes to get them to us. The next round of drinks i had to go to the bar myself to get because the waitress was too busy sitting down talking with some of the other staff. On top of the horrid service, the drinks were exceptionally watered down. All in all, the nice atmosphere is not enough to encourage me to go back."
4,The food was really good!  Great spice!  \n\nReally enjoyed the meal!
4,"The Sunset Caf\u00e9 is quite a find. The food is incredible! I would suggest the jumbo tamale or the enchiladas. That is if you can stop eating the chips and salsa. This place is a hole in the wall, but super clean with a very friendly staff."
3,"The Spotted Donkey is a great restaurant at el Pedregal at The Boulders.  One of the most scenic patios in the Valley of the Sun with top notch cuisine.  Great margaritas and ice cold Negra Modelo (yum). We started with the shrimp ceviche that was cool and refreshing, filled with flavors of pineapple, red onion, jalapeno, shrimp and lime juice.  For dinner I had the Pork Tenderloin served over green chile mac-n-cheese.  It was wonderful and bountiful serving so I was able to bring some home for lunch today.  Great for date night, lunch or with the family.  Chef Esteban serves up his delicious versions of mexican favorites."
4,"We did this for a Sunday activity for the girls for my sister's Vegas Bachelorette weekend- it was beyond AWESOME! I can't see enough good things about Roxanne and her all lady staff! Danielle did the bride's makeup and mine and we both LOVED it! Roxanne made our hair look beautiful and took the pictures. Their studios has some adorable sets and Ricky helped all the girls pick out clothing that was so sexy and flattering for each body! It was so nice have her opinion.  They all made of feel very comfortable and sexy while taking the individual pictures and we just played around for the group shot.  The individual photos came out gorgeous, especially the poses that they suggested, TRUST them!  The group shots came out very fun :).  The bride got pretty comfortable with vodka and didn't want to leave the shot she had so much fun!\nWe will totally be back again next time we are in Vegas for more photos and for their makeup class!"
1,"I was staying at the Hilton Grand Vacations across the street and down a way. I ended up gambling at the Riviera every day. Most bartenders at the poker bar are very nice and helpful. Many of the dealers are just nasty! James and Bruce are awesome. After losing hundreds to Tang, without even a smile, I wonder why anyone would keep going back to 3 card poker. If I was with the guys and not my family, I would never play here!"
4,"I feel human again!  Thanks to Toni and her mad skilllls! \n\nI went in for the first time today to get my eyebrows done.  The service was free because it was my first visit which was a plus!  However, I will be going back to Toni regularly for my waxing needs.\n\nLike mentioned in Carrie's review, Toni uses a hard wax (which has a pretty awesome color...teal hehehe) that I had never had used on me...it makes the process quick and painless.  She was very aware of how I wanted my eyebrows shaped and consistently checked to make sure I was comfortable and happy.  \n\nWhen I was all finished, she applied some cortisone to help lessen the redness that usually occurs after waxing.\n\nI was extremely satisfied and will be going back very soon!  \n\nBONUS:  When making your appointment...note the ease! Book your appointment online and you will be done in just a few clicks, followed by a text or email or BOTH reminder a couple of days in advance!  \n\nThanks, Toni!"
4,Service was wonderful ! We ordered beef cheeks stew which literally melts in your mouth and my husband has fish n chips flaky crispy batter with the delicious peas. We really enjoy the beet selection of my favorite beers was the Fullers ESB it's English and went perfectly with my meal. We were one very happy couple and will be returning soon .
0,"NOPE! HUH UH! DOO-DOO! Ok. This is pretty harsh. I was there for the first time on 9/2/2010 before the last of the Cardinals pre-season opener for a bite before the game. There was a wait....ok....got it! However, their were open tables? Don't GOT it! The hostess said \""Your table is ready\"" yay! \""Oh, by the way would you mind sitting on the patio\""? We were game for it. The Hostess then walks us through the patio and out to.....wait for it......Arizona beach area?! Low back, low to the ground wooden benches and beach style chairs. Yeah, sure in Arizona 100 plus heat. Not happening. So, we wait for an inside table. We eventually get one. The friendly waitress Jesse takes our drink order. We wait about 4 minutes or so.....perfect. Jesse takes our food order. We wait about 50 minutes for not so good food. I was with 2 other people. We ordered the following. Person #1 ordered Nacho's w/ sour cream on the side. Person #2 ordered a grilled chicken Quesadilla and I ordered fried Ice Cream. They were all terrible. The Quesadilla was as thin as Taco Bell's and three times the price. I mean they were SKIMPY! The Nacho's I was told were chewy. Nice, just what one would like, chewy nacho's. Jesse our server did apologize for the wait saying this \"" Im so sorry you had to wait. I keep telling the staff to hold off on seating people to give the kitchen a chance to get caught up\"" WELL, that explains why we could not be sat inside when there were tables open. So, like I said. Pretty bad execution, bad food, long wait. NO GOOD! If you go keep in mind too the menu is extremely limited. So, ADIOS....thats goodbye in.....well I'm just sticking with the theme, using my resources!"
4,Make your way over to paymons once and you'll be hooked. Stiff drinks and tasty mediterranean dishes await you. Make youre u get the ice base on your hookah. it burns all night long! \nDont forget tuesdays are local nights and select appeitzers are half off!
1,Stayed here for 2 weeks had a group of 20 staying here. I didn't like the place . Rooms where outdated . Casino was always busy and couldn't enjoy myself so spent the whole trip at other casinos
2,Foods okay. The chips were cooked there and its kinda quiet inside and not busy at all when I came on a Thursday's at 330 pm. I did a Togo order ...and order a salad ....and when I finally went to eat my salad ...they did not put a fork in there.....I was to far to go back....Was upset about that ...and the atmosphere was down ....the sandwich guy looked mad.... and the girl at the register was a little sad ...like she didn't want to be there.....this was my experience when I went.... Wow it's been sitting in rough draft for 1 or 2 years.... I wonder if it's still there and if so.... Is it the same ?
3,"Finally had a chance to try this place after a year driving by it. Glad I did! had their Philly Cheese steak. Meat was a good quality sliced very thin. Great taste, people there were very polite. You just need to get their during the off peak hours. When they are busy it's very hard to find parking. But it's still worth it."
1,"Got a table and that gangster'd up the eve, but overall just meh. The terrace was the only thing open the night we went, and no one was dancing on the dance floor. What? Why? Dunno. This was fine, we partied at our table, but when we tried to invite some others in to help finish our bottle (uhhh it was 5 of us, all small girls - a bottle is a lot for us to finish, don't judge) the bouncers tried to tell us we weren't aloud. Um no, we paid a ridiculous amount for this table and if we want to invite people in, we damn well better be able to. \n\nWe had an awesome time because we will pretty much have an awesome time where ever we go, but again, bouncers are d-bags. If we hadn't have had a table we'd have been in and out and ready to move on with our eve!"
1,"I was really irritated with this place.  I called up prior to heading over for a problem with my wife to check on ER wait times.  The woman on the phone was extermely rude.  She told me she could not give me that kind of information.  When I followed up with 'Is there alot of people waiting?' I received the same answer, just with more attitude.  \n\nI followed up with an additional question about insurance.  After being transfered to admissions or billing (?), someone who should know, asking the question again, a non-answer was for some reason rudely given. \""We bill all insurances\"".  OK, thats great, are you an in-network provider for my insurance?  \""I can't answer that question!\"" ...CLICK!  She hung up on me!\n\nI would give it less stars, but I really don't know how the medical staff actually is.  Support staff needs wrk!"
4,"We live in northern Arizona and whenever we go down to Phoenix, we try to go to Halo Halo Kitchen for lunch to get my Filipino food \""fix\"".  Local filipinos frequent this place (a very good sign!)  The prepared foods are always good and fresh!  Love their pinakbet, mungo beans with spinach and the upo dish!  Love their sticky rice -- not dry like rice at other Filipino and Chinese restaurants!  Always have their special halo-halo (the Best!)  The prices for combination dishes are very reasonable!  When sons of the owners are serving, they are always friendly and very accommodating!"
0,"Buyer enjoy...consignor beware.  I've been a loyal shopper for over a year and spent well over 4K in this store.  The staff has always been inconsistent, but I wasn't looking for service, at the time.  Then, I became a seller.  I gave them a few designer items, which they held for nearly a month and still hadn't placed for sale.  I went in 3 days before we were moving out of state and requested my items back, since they hadn't yet been placed on the floor.  Something which is clearly stated in their contract that they will do for a small fee.  I was met with nothing but rude and unprofessional behavior by Ashe, the \""manager\"".  She questioned me about why I wanted them, told me to leave them and then just keep calling to find put when they'd sold so they could put a check in the mail...and more questioning.  When I finally stated I wanted them back period, she told me that could take awhile, since \"" as you can see, we are very busy\"".  I said she had two days to find them, she said that was likely not possible.  She promised a call later that day with an ETA, and I got nothing.  I called the next day, they said she couldn't speak with me but would call me back.  No call.  No help from anyone.  Same the following day.  Apparently, you have to be a hostage negotiator to get YOUR OWN property back upon your request. When I called again to surrender and just change my address with them for the eventual sale...they said they couldn't do that.  Really?\nFrom a matter of principle alone, I would never shop here again, regardless of the fact that I now live elsewhere.  Just ridiculous behavior from any business.  Keep my stuff and my money, Sisters Closet...you clearly need it more than I do.  Hopefully, you use it to pay some folks to work for you that represent your business better."
1,"We went there mid day just before Thanksgiving. I can be a bit hard to find, it is right next to the AMC Theater. In fact, the back door is just steps from the entrance area of the the theater. \nIt was before their Grand Opening, so they did not have any of their beers on tap yet. (we went their to try some of their beers) What they did have on tap was an excellent selection. Our bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. We were going to have lunch as well. My son had one of their sandwiches. It was huge and he said it was very good. I opted for the carne asada tacos. The meat was all gristle. I actually had to spit it out on plate. (ugh) The tacos came with rice and beans. Those came in a small container (the kind used for a side of ranch dressing) the Spanish rice was all dried out and the beans were just a small amount of black beans. We are talking $11 for this meal of two(gristly) tacos. (they did take it off the bill without me asking)\nEverything else was just fine. We went to a movie and decided to return to BRI for a bit. Had another beer then decided to just go to Red Robin on the other side of Stapley for a burger. \nI was excited about a brew pub in Mesa. I live in far east Mesa. I will probably stick with Four Peaks."
1,"Slow service, and drink order was messed up. Not a very busy night and had to wait too long to get our appetizers and meals.  Nice visual appearance but very dissapointed in the restaurant atmosphere with what is suppose to be new orleans style hospitality.\n\nBut I have to say the food did not dissapoint!"
2,This place is just OK... Not terrible and not great. The food is good but you will not find anything on the menu that is heavy and greasy. It would be nice to have something crisp and light when it is 105 degrees outside. Also the atmosphere is pretty good... It is really more a BBQ place than a bar.
4,"Great ice cream (Perry's, which is especially exciting for me since I'm from the Buffalo area), great flavors, great service and for a great cause.  I'll be trying to earn that 11th free ice cream!"
0,"Don't do it. Just don't. You're better of with some frozen boxes out of the freezer section of the grocery store. \n\nOur dish was half hot, warm in the middle, and cold on the other side. The dessert was stale and bland. \n\nBF was BLOATED like he was in his third trimester and miserable for TWO days after. Ew."
2,"First off, this place is not a club. It's a bar, so treat it accordingly. Personally, I had fun, but I did not expect much either. Maybe it was an exception of a night, but it seemed like everyone was having a good time here.\n\n We got in for happy hour, $2 beer, 2for1 on drinks and no cover, and decided to stay longer. The girls on stage kept pouring free shots for the ladies and even the guys, most girls in the place could get up on stage and dance and a few girls left their bras on their trophy ceiling. The place was pretty full but not packed and it was a pretty young crowd. The music could have been better, but then again for a while they utilize the jukebox, so it's up to the patrons what is played. Lots of Sweet Home Alabama and 80s kind of stuff."
1,"Descriptive phrase: a promising pub run poorly.\n\nMy friends and I used to practically live at Lucky's. We were as close to being regulars as you could be without working there. The bartenders knew us, the food was good and plentiful, the suds were flowing, and good times were had by all. My, how time changes places.\n\nLucky's is one of the few bars on Regent that used to openly accept the college scene while still trying to cater to the locals. The place itself is rather large inside, with a hidden back area. There are tons of flat-screen TVs everywhere, with a few games and blaring music. \n\nThe specials used to be great, with dollar corn dogs and beers on Thursdays being my favorite. We knew the bartenders by name and they made good and cheap drinks for us, serving the food quickly. \n\nAt some point, it was like a light switch flipped (a former bartender later told us the owner lost it and started demanding change). Immediately the bartenders were sullen every day, making weak drinks and complaining, yes complaining to a customer, about any request that wasn't \""vodka sprite\"" or \""beer\"". They went from loving us (we must've spent hundreds of dollars there over the course of one school year) to verbally expressing their frustration with serving us. \n\nThe bar started catering more to the fratty crowds coming from smaller colleges in the area and capitalizing on their drunken tastebuds and open wallets. Some staff left, and the staff that stayed got either lazier or more frazzled. They even lost my friend's credit card one night in their rush. \n\nI will always have fond memories of the past Lucky's, but I don't plan on returning anymore. It's not a horrible place now, but it fell from such heights."
3,"Are you supposed to be drunk for this? On drugs?  Well I was neither and man, was it weird! \n\nThis was my 2nd Cirque show (I've been to 3 now) and my first on in Vegas.  As always, the acrobatics were great and the production set was beautiful.\n\nThis was by far, the trippy-est Cirque show I've been to though.  The baby giggles and head were so creepy and weird!  \n\nCirque is always beautiful but I get the impression this isn't the best they can do in Vegas either."
2,"Bij binnenkomst goed geholpen. Keurige kamer zo op het eerste gezicht. Ruim, met woonkamertje, keukentje, slaapkamer en badkamer in een. Best netjes voor het aantal sterren. \n\nWiFi is slecht, je wordt er steeds af gegooid. Maar goed, who needs WiFi in Vegas?\n\nHet bijbehorende casino+bar is best grappig, alleen niet voor muggenzifters/kleinzerigen. Terwijl wij lekker een drankje dronken en een gokje waagden ontstond er een vechtpartijtje achter ons, waarop direct werd ingegrepen. Ja, er komen hier dus ook asociale omwonenden gokken en drinken. \n\nDe shuttlebus naar de Vegas-Strip verdient een groot compliment, deze rijdt gratis van 07:00 tot 22:00 en brengt en haalt je. Topservice!"
0,"Went here for drinks for one night. They called last call and 5 minutes later they kicked everyone out, making my friend chug her beer. And meanwhile it wasn't closing time yet. Very crappy service."
1,"Since ditching the pirate theme, TI is hotel with identity crisis.  Not impressed with the room which had broken fixtures & loud A/C.  spa is a joke which have to pay $17 extra.  Only plus is good location.  Stay at Rio for $50 Less and much better room"
3,"Burt says - Oscars Beef, Booze, and Broads. (that's really their logo) is Old Vegas style!!!\n\nFinally a restaurant that's not afraid to use seasoning.  \n\nThe food is NOT top notch.  But it's  a very good restaurant with a really cool room (make sure you sit in the Dome Room or don't even go).  The \""old Vegas\"" atmosphere is charming.  The view straight down Fremont Street is great, other than the new Zip line ride blocking the view under construction.  How does a guy who used to be the mayor and is married to the current mayor allow a Zip line to block the view at his own restaurant?  I'm guessing when construction is completed it wont be as obtrusive..........Or else.  \n\nThe Prime rib was extra tasty.  Burt's hint - Order it one degree under what you would usually order it at.  \n\nMom ordered the Schnitzel and loved it. Also the Caroline cocktail.  Burt's broad ordered the Halibut.  She didn't \""love\"" it, but if you ask Burt, what the hell is this broad ordering Halibut for in a steakhouse?  \n\nFor a side make sure you order the corn.  It was great.  The mac and cheese and the au gratin potatoes were OK.  \n\nGood cappuccino and very good chocolate moose.  NY style cheesecake was good.\n\nAgain, NOT the greatest food.  But, very good and as a whole the experience was fun."
1,"La Condesa, I give up on you. We try and try to excuse the terrible service, but no more. It's not worth it. It's too slow and inattentive and they just don't give a damn, so I'll take my $33 elsewhere.\n\nThis time we were disappointed by the food, too. We returned our horchata for being too thin and tasteless, and you brought us new ones after we finished eating. You drizzled a pretty crema all over the top of my torta (sorry, lonche). How do I pick it up and eat it? \n\nIn the past we forgave the dirty tables and loudness because your cochinita pibil was pure bliss. But not even that makes up for the service. :("
4,Lily Barajas is an awesome manager!! Just remember it takes time for the great food!!
0,First time ever there!!!  Ordered a salad with apples and cranberries among other things...no apples in the salad..what's the point of paying extra for a salad if you are not getting what is supposed t o be in it??  Never again!  I hate rip offs!!!  P.s.  Their french fries suck...my husband ordered them and their hamburgers were not even thick!
2,The BTL Sandwich is okay. The bread is from Home. If you like how your mother make sandwich then okay. I think the bread fatter...
1,"First and foremost I would like to say that the pretzel fondue is amazing...although it is something familiar that I have tasted before so I wouldnt go out of your way to go here. Their drink combinations are pretty good. Their food is small portions for the price! Atmosphere is unique and almost every table has a different set of chairs and style which is different. \n\nThe reason I am giving Culinary a terrible review in stars is because my poor boyfriend got food poisoning from the Beef Stroganoff! We came into AZ to re visit my college town and friends and he was out all day saturday, most of sunday, and still not up to par on Monday! I realize this was not their fault that their food was possibly contaminated, however, it was the aftermath that I was unhappy with...\n\nI called the restaurant to talk to the manager....he didnt seem to sympathetic with saying things like \""did he go to the hospital?\"" or \""I served 27 of that dish Saturday Night and I have not had one complaint yet.\"".....definitely not looking for any type of discount but with working in customer service for 10 years that is NOT the way to handle things. He was proceeding to tell me the length of time it can take and how it could have been from something earlier that day or the night before...really?! Needless to say even though I did not feel sick from the food I will NEVER return to this restaurant again!!! I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone!"
4,Thank you so much for making my husband's birthday party such a wonderful success.  We had the most delicious salad (greek was amazing) pizza (all fantastic) and stromboli (delicious and our 1st time having one)  The owner was so helpful and generous with us and we loved our meal so much.  We look forward to visiting Las Vegas again and having Biaggio's delivered to our hotel room!!!
2,"The Pros: Inexpensive menu, fresh food, great malts, clean restaurant, friendly smiling employees, pepper bar. \n\nCons: Stale and not creative dining area, awkward layout in the dining room, seen before menu options, pre-made salad dressings.\n\nGood for a quick burger. In my opinion there are other burger options in town that I prefer."
2,"This place was surprisingly good, considering it's at a food court. After a long night of partying, I really wanted some hangover food.... and I found it! \n\nAt first glance, I thought this place was your typical fast-food chinese place, but when I looked at the menu, I saw that they serve udon - yumm! I ordered the tempura udon and my boyfriend had the seafood soup. The broth was super hot and reallyyyy soothing. It didn't have a ton of flavor but I didn't really mind - I just wanted something hot. The noodles seemed pretty fresh and were also really good. The udon came with 3 tempura shrimps. It was a bit heavy on the batter but it was alright when I soaked it in the soup first. For $8, it wasn't a bad meal.\n\nI think I read on someone else's review that they charge $0.10 for water? The lady that helped us was really nice and gave us 2 cups of it for free."
4,The pour over coffee was very good!  I found it because of all the great reviews on Yelp and they all are correct - it's a great place to get a cup of your favorite coffee drink.
4,"Although not much to look at, the pizza, pasta and salads we had were fabulous (including the gluten free pizza!). The staff was great. And those garlic knots . . . mmmmm."
3,"This was my favorite stop on Saddlebag Trail on a recent trip to Scottsdale. The staff was friendly and the drinks were reasonably priced. The place did not have the huge lines like Hi-Fi and Whiskey Row which even made it more popular to my group. \n\nAlso, there is a mini skee ball game in the back and a lost & found vending machine."
1,"Every time you move to a new city and ask about the places to go for good food, there are a few names everyone rattles off.  Salt is one of those in Pittsburgh.\n\nIf this were a quasi-French restaurant I might understand the price point, but no such pomp and circumstance.  The decor I think is great for a casual dinner, and a fancier date that you don't want to feel too stuffy.  I don't care that you have your own place setting and fancy silverware-- it's at a communal table (unless you reserve upstairs).  The service was no different than anything you'd expect at Elbow Room, it's fine.\n\nMy barometer for any restaurant is a simple protein.  It says a lot about how they pick ingredients, their philosophy about bringing flavor out vs. marinating, timing in the kitchen.  So I got a hangar steak. Why? No idea. This is a cut closely resembling flank, the stuff people use in fajitas and beef stir fry (read: marinade the shit out of it to make it taste good).  The dish came out looking like an art piece, but the meat was so thin it didn't retain any heat and it felt like eating the steak off the top of a fancy salad... without the salad.  To their credit, it was cooked well and I could see the idea behind it, just didn't taste good because the cut itself was lacking.  Scallops were the same story.  Good ingredients, great plating, light fluffy flavors and not too buttery.  \n\nWe had two drinks a piece. I don't tend to get fancy cocktails but two Hendricks tonics and two Rieslings brought the total to $130 with tip.  Humbly two stars from me because feeling \""fine\"" after leaving a place like that is disappointing.  Went straight to Wendy's afterwards and got some chicken nuggets."
1,Not very good. Edible but not good. I could go into details but why. I've had great Mexican food in Cali and this is not even close.
2,"This places food is so delicious I seriously love their cheesesteaks, what telly brings them down is there service. The people working there show no customer service skills what so ever, they would rather stand around and gossip than assit a paying customer. But the food...is a 5/5 in my book only reason I keep coming back."
2,"Join CF because it's the only full service gym in the downtown Madison area. I was attracted to the fact that they include a lot of free classes & all the yoga you could want, it is big enough to have your own space and it has a Kidszone.\n\nPros:  \n\n1. As far as I can tell, I have always been able to get on equipment that I want. I normally don't go at peak hours so I can't tell you if this is true all the time\n\n2. Locker room seems clean, has two saunas and a steam room if you are into that. Plenty of lockers between the two in the building.\n\n3. Doesn't have a smelly gym smell to the workout area or locker room. \n\n4. Easy to get into classes if you plan just slightly ahead. Some classes are more popular than others. Over all very good yoga instructors. \n\nCons:\n\n1. Kidszone is a complete joke!\n\nThey either need to embrace the concept or give it up. Right now, it's a poor excuse for a place to take your kids while you work out. It would seem like the person who is responsible for managing the Kidszone isn't a parent or forgets what it was like to have little kids....\n\nThe kids play area is lacking any real activities. I have a 5 & 3 yr old and they absolutely hate going there. They say it is boring and I can't blame them. There are a few mats to play on and not much more. There needs to be something more to play with... ie: TOYS! You know, those things kids love to play with... They don't have to be fancy... a few books, some blocks, a few cars and trucks, maybe a small dramatic play area.....  It doesn't take much to keep a kid busy for an hour but they really need more than a few gym mats.\n\nAlso, they won't change diapers or help older children use the restroom... What?? If you are going to have a kidzone, it comes with the territory.... Diapers, maybe but little kids & bathroom, you need to help them if they're toilet trained. The restrooms are not equipped for little kids so it would be hard for a little kid to get up on the toilet. Also, anyone who has little kids know that they may have to go 20 mins after they just went...  If you won't change diapers, you need to have a bathroom equipped to change diapers... diaper changing table would help! \n\nNon-engaging kidszone employees. Being so close to Univ of WI, you would think Capitol Fitness would have access to a ton of early childcare majors or even early education students who would like to have a chance and work at a place to gain some real work experience.   At least from the the few times I was there, there was no real engagement happening between the employee and the kids.   It's like my neighbor's kids are watching my kids. \n\nOn the flip side, if Capitol Fitness is just doing the kidszone so they can say they have one but don't really want to have kids actually in the gym, then they are very successful.  \n\n2. Parking is definitely a hassle during the week if you want to be close. If you don't want to pay for parking, go after 6:00 pm when the meters stop or park a few blocks away in the neighborhood.\n\n3. The interior of the gym is definitely looking somewhat dated. It's dark and dim. The atmosphere is sort of muted and not very motivating. The gym is starting to show it's age.\n\n4. Not a lot of sanitize wipes  / hand sanitizer around which is why I see people skipping off the equipment without cleaning it.   I've been in gyms where they are all over the place so it unavoidable not to clean the equipment after you are done.\n\n5. Towels. I know people already talked about this. I will say that they do have a ton of hand towels and a limited number of small gym towels available to use without charge.  If you need to take a shower but forget to bring your own, you could make due with two smaller gym towel. \n\nOverall, the gym is about average and you get what you pay for ($44 mth). My old gym in DC was twice the cost but provided twice the service.  So for this price range and if you exclude the consideration of a kidzone, I would say the gym is average. There are better gyms in the Madison which are probably a better value compared to service but, you have to drive out in suburbs to go there... if you live anywhere near west, near east or downtown, this is probably your only choice for a full service fitness center. Until Capitol Fitness has a full service gym close by as it's competitive, we probably won't see much change.   \n\nThe Bright Side!\nThere are a lot of new big buildings going up in the next few years on the E. Washington Ave corridor so it will be just a matter of time until we'll see so other gym move into the area... It's up to Capitol Fitness Management to see if they can stay ahead and keep the gym relevant before people leave for something better..."
3,"Food and service were wonderful, and the tomato salad and rack of lamb (which I ordered rare) magnificent.  Only complaint was the steady thump-thump of the music (if you can call it that) which sounded like a grim heartbeat - the most depressing sound I've ever heard as background to a fine French dinner."
2,"the portions are generous and the staff is friendly and helpful. but the food is just ok. nothing to write home about. i was really interested in going here for quite sometime, maybe that had something to do with why I thought the food was so bland. I had it built up in my head to be better than it was."
4,"Great tourist attraction. feature shops, botquies, night clubs, art museums, Good Luck with finding a place to park. I highly recommend valet.\n\nThere is so much history in Old Town. You can find historical museums or take a ride on the trolley. My favorites are all the options to dine at after taking a stroll through all the shops. \n\nFarmers Market on Saturday's with local vendors. That is another great perk about old down many local shops and boutiques with a variety of things to enjoy."
2,"So this hotel is about 30 minutes by car from where you want to be in Edinburgh. I came with a tour group, so it might not be your typical experience. \n\nThe staff is amazingly kind and extremely helpful, but wifi cost something like \u00a37 per hour or something like \u00a316 for 24 hours! There is free wifi in common areas like the lounge, bar, caf\u00e9s with a very strong signal, but it's not great when you are having an emergency at home and end up bawling in the lounge area like I did. Another guest brought me tissues and a very nice employee brought me water... \n\nThere is a great gym, pool and even workout classes are offered! I'm not sure about the golf, but it looked pretty. The beds were very comfy, but while doing yoga in the room, I encountered hair belonging to someone else which made me think it wasn't vacuumed well.  \n\nBest breakfast so far this trip with omelette bar and amazing number of hot choices."
0,Do not go here! Horrible service! Horrible attitudes!! Stay away!!!!!
1,Meh could take it or leave it!  Cashier took 10 minutes to write our Id numbers down when ordering wine with dinner because a person in our party looked under 21 but was in fact 30. Food was so so aside from salad other dishes were just meh. The French onion soup was good tho. Prolly won't eat here again
3,"Oh the Deuce Double Decker bus transit system! How much I love you! Cause walking is for suckers! I just wish you would show up on time more often... but for $3 for one way, $7 for 24 hours, or $15 for a three day pass, you are so worth it! They only take cash on the bus, I never had the opportunity to purchase a pass from the select Deuce machines along the strip, but I'm pretty positive it's the same way. \n\nThe Deuce stops quite frequently on the strip, I wouldn't say at every hotel, maybe every other hotel. Most of the drivers are friendly, I did experience 2 of the drivers with road rage, which I think was more entertaining than anything! LOL \n\nI have noticed how much busier this bus transit is now than it was, 4 years ago... in mid February of 2010, there were times where we had to wait for the following bus 3 different occasions because of the bus being full. If your not in a big hurry to catch a show on the strip, it's not a big deal, but if you have all the time in the world, this is the bus for you!"
0,"We came here because we live across the street and really wanted to have some yummy food close by. \nWe ordered crab puffs and spring rolls/egg rolls (depending on your menu), crab puffs were a huge disappointment not enough crab meat or cream cheese.  The spring roll was ok tasting but it didn't have a lot inside of it.  \nThere is no children's menu, I find that not to be family friendly, we ordered garlic noodles minus the mushrooms and sliced BBQ pork for my kids.  When the garlic noodles and BBQ pork came out it looked and smelled delicious, and they were both tasty.  BUT halfway through eating the garlic noodles my daughter noticed a DEAD fly in the noodles, yuck!  So they took the noodles and remade them but I was disappointed that they still charged us for the noodles.  \nMy husband and I split the orange shrimp which had way too much breading and tiny shrimp inside.  They also skimped on the orange sauce which I would loved to have more of.  \nOverall disappointment...will not be back."
2,"Seeking fried goodness and cheap beer? Belly on up to Vinnie's. And maybe bring some stretchy pants. \n\nI've been to Vinnie's a few times and I'm always intrigued by their super cheap brew specials (as Michael E. points out). This is a great little spot to grab a beer and some grub and watch the game. The waitresses here are always friendly and sport teeny little tanks - which I'm sure is a big hit with the guys. \n\nI'm really happy that smoking is outlawed indoors, as this place used to be almost unbearable in the evenings. No one likes to have a big side of smoke with their shrimp po' boy. And by the way, although a ton of their menu is fried (and well made), they do offer a great crab leg special on Monday nights that I am just itching to try. \n\nPer hubs, this is an amazing place to score oysters, too! \n\nNow...which Monday am I going to plant myself for unlimited crab legs...?"
0,This use to be one of my favorite pizza places till it took over an hour for my Delivery to get to me and then they charged my credit card and when it got to me they tried to make me pay cash when I already paid. I'm not happy with the service I have received from them and this will be the last time I order from them. I don't feel it is Appropriate to charge your customers twic
2,"I had heard soooo much about Body English I was a bit nervous it wouldn't live up to the hype.  It didn't.  \n \nTwo years ago when my husband and I were in Vegas we didn't really understand how the clubs worked.  So we made a feeble attempt to go to Body English....we waited in line for an hour (the first, last, and only time I've ever waited in a line for a club....) until we just decided to drink and gamble in the Hard Rock.  2 years later we are much older and wiser.  And better connected.   I gave my host a call who put us on the guest list.  Because we listen to everything she tells us to do we got there at 10:30 right when it was opening.  I was the first one in the club that evening.  The bouncer looked at everyone else and decided on us.  This is why I love my host.  The bouncer was even nice enough to comp us the admission price so we were the first to be let in with no waiting and no cover.  Just how I like it. \n \nUnfortunately, that is really where the fun ends.  Body English is really just one room.  There isn't much done to make it aesthically pleasing either.  The music was awful.  AWFUL.  I love Common, don't get me wrong, but a nightclub isn't the place.  I also wasn't impressed that they were relaxing their dress code policy and people were coming in and tshirts and sneakers.  If you're going to have a strict policy make it strict and keep it strict.  I was so underwhelmed.  I think it is just too clubby for me.....I'm more of an ultra lounge kind of gal."
2,"Not too bad!  Been to this location several times, still have not loved it yet.  \n\nThe antipasta platter was ok.  The mozzarella was good; the brushette had too much pesto; and calamari was not crispy enough.  The chicken marsala was ok too.  I tasted more of the grill of the chicken than the marsala sauce.  The mash potatoes were good.    I should have stuck to my usual pasta carrabba.  \n\nThe service is always excellent!"
4,"The husband and I love this place. We have been coming here ever since we moved to the neighborhood and both the food and service is consistently amazing. We have tried most of the breakfast menu but haven't dived into the lunch menu. Our favorite is the Gouda brizza (breakfast pizza) - smoked gouda, bacon, hollandaise sauce, and scrambled eggs. Yum! On lazy weekends, we order this to go and enjoy back at our place. When we dine in, it's a mix. Their Costa breakfast burrito is delicious - something the husband orders frequently. I really like their mushroom and bacon omelet, but I also enjoy their \""two eggs anyway\"" meal. I normally get scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, and fruit (instead of potatoes). Super delicious and filling. Another favorite are the Biscuits and Gravy. Now this is amazing! The biscuits are super soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. They just melt in your mouth! The gravy is the perfect accompaniment. It's thick and filled with sausage. These are some of the best B&Gs I've had! The best part is how inexpensive yet utterly delicious they are! \n\nI love that it's a local place that uses local food. Everything is fresh and the staff is outstanding. We've taken both sets of parents here as well as friends. This is definitely the go-to breakfast place. If you are ever in the area, you should definitely check it out!"
1,Customer  service  was horrible my wife waited for 10 min. For someone to take her order. Then I waited for a refill for 15 min while one of workers walked  around the kitchen not doing anything. She looked straight  at me and didn't ask if I needed anything. Food is OK not the greatest. If customer  service is better I would recommend  it.
2,"These cupcakes can be hit or miss.  There are certain items like the chocolate peanut butter which  can really cause addiction, while there are others like the key lime, and red velvet which taste like any other key lime or red velvet cupcake.  These cupcakes are seriously expensive and there is always a pretty large line to get one.  With those two things in mind I am not so sure that its worth the trip. That is unless you are already addicted to a certain flavor."
3,"I like MadHouse, but this actually isn't a review at all--I just wanted to say that when I try to access MadHouse's website, I ALWAYS get a trojan warning from my browser. I think the site is infected. I hope the owners see this!"
4,"My dog Raegan has been a patient at CVMH for 2 years. I absolutely love the care she has received here and completely trust the doctors and friendly staff.  In addition to very competent care we also enjoy the fun events held at CVMH, like the Christmas Santa pictures event. Finally, I am a big animal lover and greatly respect the work CVMH does with the big cats animal sanctuary!"
2,"Good coffee ... i'm not eating doughnuts or bagels at the moment, so it's hard to rate their signature foods. Ask me again in 40 pounds."
3,"I love whole foods ! The groceries are soooo fresh and decently priced but the only drawback is the employees... \nThey're kinda rude and don't have much of a personality... The cashiers don't hold much of a conversation, they seem so miserable working here! \nEven though the employees are lame, it won't keep me from giving whole foods my business that's why I am giving four stars!!"
2,"I honestly really wanted to like this place, but it unfortunately ended up disappointing me.\n\nLets start with the good. This place is seriously nice inside. There's a great patio area and it seems like a really cool place to hang out with your friends. Very clean inside and very friendly staff. I'd be happy to spend a few hours here with some good company.\n\nFrom then it starts to go bad. I was just passing by and decided to try this place. It was such a slow night that they were closing up 3.5 hours earlier than their listed hours (closed around 10:30pm). I got a beef taco to go and price to size it was actually a really good deal. The tortilla was warm and reminded me a little like flat bread. There was high quality lettuce and everything looked great. Then I bit into it. It was way too salty that I couldn't taste anything at all. \n\nI think I'll come back in a couple weeks (if they're still open then) and try the food again. It has a lot going for it and other than the salt content would be an awesome place to relax."
4,"Loved the warm garlic bread with Gorgonzola fondue, yummy! \nTheir porterhouse with baked/mashed potatoes was the bomb!\n\nAlthough it is pricey the food is excellent."
4,Saw Mike Tyson! Hahaha Sweeet
3,"Sky Zone! Jumpies! LOVE IT!\n\nThey have a full adult area where you can jump and flip to your hearts desire... or fall, like me, hahaha. Often times they net off one or two ends for competitions/special events. Every 30 min they let in a new crowd and it cam get VERY crowded to show up early-  Like Opening!\n\nIf you have kids, they have a kiddie area, which is a lot of fun as well, you can throw balls around and the don't let the words \""kiddie area\"" fool you, it can get pretty rough in there (but in a fun, not dangerous way). \n\nIf you've never been, you've got to try it. And don't be afraid, just let go and enjoy!"
3,"Clean, really good service, quiet, and delicious of course. :)"
0,"If you could give zero stars, I would.  Seated on a Wednesday afternoon for a drink and sat, then sat, then sat some more.  Apparently no one was interested in taking our order as no one stopped by our table so we left after 10 minutes."
1,"Went this restaurant last weekend for a late breakfast. Had SUPER Sweet with TONS of whipped cream triple chocolate cappuccino, tasted just okay Egg white omelet, and weird sour flavor smoked salmon Benedict. The place is fancy, however, the food is not okay and the price is a little bit too high. Maybe I should just order liquor or dessert over there next time."
1,"Apparently, I am in the minority with my opinion of this place.  While the coffee is good, it shouldn't take 20 minutes to process my order.  I don't care if they are personally flying to Columbia right after I order to hand pick the beans right before they make it...20 minutes is unacceptable. \n\nAnd then when I place my order, I shouldn't be insulted by the guy making it.  Yes, I asked for non-fat milk.  I didn't ask you to put Ketchup in my drink, I asked for non-fat milk.  Don't treat me like I am mentally challenged.  I weigh 165lbs, do you really think I order non-fat because I am concerned with my weight?  No business should EVER ask a customer what the point of their order is the way this dude asked me.  \n\nI want to like this place, I do.  The atmosphere and location were great, and the hot tattooed blond sitting at the counter was fun to flirt with (I think she could tell the guy annoyed me).  So for this, I will give it another shot.  A lot of the people I know rave about this place.  Maybe I just hit it on an off day.  If I get the same attitude the next time, I might drop trough mid store."
3,Great German beer and food. I will be back!!
1,Don't understand the 3-5 stars for this place.  It smells divine when you walk in though that is for sure.  Ordered the organic agave margarita - good drink but the appetizer (shrimp brochette) was only meh and my grilled fish tacos (yellow tail) were not good - fish was dry and I like some mango or pineapple type sauce with it to counteract the savory fish - overall ok but won't be back.
3,"If you read my review regarding LAX in Hollywood, you would know that I hated it mainly because I didn't get in after standing in line for 2 hours.\n\nTHIS time, however, I waited in line for less than an hour AND got in for free thanks to our Luxor room key card.  I highly suggest staying at the Luxor hotel if you plan on hitting this club up, especially if there is a special event going on.  That night I got to see Nicole from the Pussycat Dolls sing 3 songs as well as Dwayne Wade making it rain.  I don't remember the latter part because I was too gone to notice.\n\nAs far as the club goes, the dance floor is really small and you have to fight for a spot.  Once you have enough drinks in you, this will of little significance, especially if you have other friends making room for you to dance.  It was really easy to buy a drink and the bars were not that crowded at all.  I had a really great time but it was mostly because of the intoxicated state.  Otherwise, I would probably give this club 2 or maybe 3 stars for ease of buying a drink and crowd."
0,"Haven't gone here in a long time and I have to say things haven't changed. \n\nI decided to see if it had gotten any better, I am referring to the service. it doesn't matter who you get they are all equally terrible and rude. This will be my very last visit here since nothing will ever change. \n\nI ordered a Thai Chai tea with milk (cold version). The lady delivers my drink and I tasted it and it was pure sugar you couldn't taste anything else but sugar! On prior occasions this was not the case! I asked her to take it back and add more milk less Thai tea. So she brings it back but no change at all even after adding more milk. So after taking one sip I told her I could not drink it and she actually had the $&@;! to tell me not to order it again that it would always be like that. She was lecturing me like a child and for the sake of not making a usual scene like I would if I was alone. This time I was quiet and didn't talk back. \n\nSo it's safe to say if you like crappy service and being lectured just go here!"
2,"I hate being the person that brings bad news to a business.  But I would rather Yelp about it and people know rather than it goes unnoticed.  More on that later in the review. \n\nI booked this stay about two months prior to me showing up on New Year's Eve.  Check it went fairly smooth with a little bump.  I forgot one of my IDs in my car and could not be checked in until after I had that ID in hand.  After walking back to my car I returned and everything went smoothly afterwards.  Kudos to the front desk staff for allowing me to leave my bag there instead of having to drag it back to my car and back to the hotel.\n\nThe room itself gave the impression that it was huge.  As several people have already stated, the ceiling were very high.  I was lucky enough to have a front facing room that looked out over Penn Ave.  I kind of loved this as I could watch the New Year's Eve parade from my room and save myself from the freezing temps outside.  However, you could tell that this was an older building as the floors creaked as I walked around the room.  I could also hear the person above as they walked about.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean.  I am not sure how this happened, but I got a handicap room.  So I am assuming that this is why everything felt so spacious in here as well.  Everything about the room screamed modern, from the paint colors to the carpeting.  \n\nNow, to get back to what I was referring to at the beginning; the bad news.  Upon arriving at the hotel and after checking in I decided I needed to take a nap in preparations for the night's festivities.  It was a fairly short nap, roughly about an hour.  When I woke up after my nap and turned on the light, I noticed something crawling across the sheets.  *starts itching*  Yes people, it was what you are thinking, a bedbug.  BEDBUG!  I immediately grabbed a tissue to dispose of the hideous little monster (I know, it did me no good by doing that, it was more of a reflexive response than anything).  I have made contact with Courtyard about this, but have yet to hear back from them on how they are going to rectify the problem.  I felt dirty afterward and moved all of my belongings into the bathroom, on the counter for the remainder of my stay.  I also slept in the other bed (I know, that may have been futile) and with the lights on for the rest of my stay.\n\nOther than that snag, I really have no complaints about this place.  Everything and everyone was pleasant.\n\n*Things to note: there is room service available, valet service, or if you prefer, park in one of the city garages and walk to the hotel, business center, fitness center, ATM and Starbucks available around the clock at the front desk."
4,"Let's face it, we all have our favorite sushi restaurant and we hate to waiver from what we \""know\"".  Trust me, there is green grass on the other side.  This place has an amazing staff and sushi with a flare.  Hayley my server was the best.  Thank you!"
2,"YAY! They have SPAM!!!!!\n\nI was going to go for Meat Plate #4 but when I saw the Grilled Spam with Eggs, I was in love. I don't care what you Spam-haters have to say. I'm Asian through and through and will stick to my Spam. Mmmm.. sooo salty and meat-like. \n\nIt was just what I expected, Spam, fried eggs and rice with some macaroni salad. It was good. Reminded me of the days when my parents didn't cook and we would fry up some Spam to eat with white rice and soy sauce. \n\nMy friends were kinda 'eh' about their dishes. It also took a long time for the food to come out for them too.\n\nOne cool thing about this place was that the Phoenix Fire Department eats here.... so hot! Too bad I was busy stuffing my face with Spam and eggs. That was probably not hot."
2,"I'm a sushi junkie. I've hit up almost every sushi joint that I've been able to find in Phoenix including the places that identified merely with a yellow sign outside that says...\""SUSHI\""! \n\nThat's why I was so excited to try out Yen. I loved the place the second I walked in. The atmosphere was great, the people were friendly, and the location for me is excellent. Unfortunately for this sushi joint...I really only care about the sushi. That's why one of my favorite places in town is a hole in wall over on Dunlap and 19th Ave. I was so disappointed with the quality of the fish and the actual rolls. We ordered about eight rolls and only finished two of them. You basically have your choice of eel or fried and these are tempura battered rolls I'm talking about. I enjoy light sushi which is the way sushi is supposed to be. A fried tuna roll that weighs over a pound is just too heavy. I'll give it another shot for sure because I really do think it's a nice place but I was shocked that it's Yelp score was as high as it was."
4,"After stumbling through various Japanese restaurants that serve decent bowls of ramen, I've finally found a place that specializes at it. In fact, it's pretty much all they serve. Their menu reminded me of an In-N-Out menu: You either order a tonkotsu ramen or a miso ramen. If you don't want ramen, there's fried rice and some basic Japanese apps. Not much in terms of variety. But, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.\n\nI started off with an order of gyoza for an app. Simple stuff and what you'd expect. Nothing to write home about. Then, came the steamy bowl of tonkotsu ramen. The broth was a real winner here. A lot of places that I have tried never really got the broth quite right. This was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. Even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. Next time I drop by, I will probably give their fried rice a shot.\n\nMonta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when I went. It started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles. I wouldn't expect a wait for a table, but I could see it happening if this place picks up in popularity."
2,"Oh Sally's... Always an adventure. \n\nThis store has the stuff I want at great prices. You save more if you buy a member card ($5/year- not too bad). \n\nLike the reviewer below, I would also agree that the employees are less than helpful. They don't attempt to ask if you need help and don't have much to say when I ask questions about their products. They look miserable- like they can't wait to get out of work. Oh well, it doesn't seem like there is any manager/supervisor type of person so I accept that this is just the way it is...\n\nLuckily I know my way around Sally's and the website has customer reviews to help you decide on products. That does mean that I have to do research online before coming in since I can't rely on the employees which is just a little inconvenient. \n\nAll-in-all, a great selection of products at good prices but mediocre service."
2,"Very cute. We went here for breakfast at 7am. before we had to fly out, so I can't really rate this based on their busy time. Our waiter was really nice and polite. The bread was real good. Breakfast was yummy too. The eggs and hashbrowns were made well. My husband got the steak and eggs meal. They made it nice and juicy. \n\nAlthough, this place is really expensive for breakfast. For the price, you think you'd get \""knock your socks off\"" type of food. Orange juice was $4.00, AND our waiter didn't even come back to see if my husband wanted more. Which leads me to believe that there's no free refills on that. \n\nI guess you can say it's okay if you don't mind spending that much on your breakfast. In Vegas though, you could probably find better for a cheaper price."
0,"You know how they have all those television commercials saying, \""If you have a job, we'll put you in a car?\""  This is supposed to be regardless of credit history or location of said job.  I took it for what it was worth, and provided a legitimate job offer to them, one with a starting salary of $55,000/yr, in the door.  I know I have a bad credit rating, as I am still recovering from filing a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy just over 2 years ago, so I am expecting a higher interest rate, which I will have no problem paying to re-establish my credit rating.\n\nI was told that my possible trade-in car wasn't worth much as a trade-in, but if I could come up with $1,000 as a down payment, they would be willing to waive the trade-in requirement and pre-approve me to get into a newer car.  I took the salesman at his word and found a third party individual who was in dire need of a car, and he bought my car for over $1,000.  I called up my insurance company to put in notice that I was purchasing a newer car and needed to upgrade my State minimum to full coverage.  My premium was duly increased, but since I was still covered until the middle of July, I didn't have to make any payments until next month, so all is well so far.\n\nI find out my loan was approved by the bank, but there was a small hiccup:  The bank would not release the funds to the dealer until the first day of my new job.  The new job starts on June 6th, 2011, and the dealer's owner decides at the last moment that he doesn't want to approve the deal because, Heaven forbid, the new job is in Washington, DC...700+ miles away from the middle of nowhere.  The dealer is afraid that just because I have a job offer, it doesn't mean I have been hired, and if I take their 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis to Washington, D.C. and am unable to pay for my car, they have no way of getting their car back.\n\nSo I am now left out in the cold, without a car from O'Brien, without a car that was actually running because I had let someone else purchase it from me, expecting to get a newer car, and now I have to take a bus or train to Washington, DC with just a duffle bag full of clothes and $1,000 in my pocket.  Thanks O'Brien, your false advertisements made such a difference in my life.  So where's the fine print saying that the customer's job offer has to be within 150 miles of the dealer?"
4,"I buy all of my tires at Discount Tire and my recent experience here just reminded me why. I noticed on Saturday morning that I had a nail stuck in the sidewall of my tire and decided that before waking up on Monday morning with a flat I'd better get it taken care of right away. Because the nail was in the sidewall, the tire had to be replaced, not repaired. However, because I always purchase the replacement certificates with my tires, it only cost me $20 for a brand new Pirelli tire. As always at Discount Tire, service was outstanding and my tire was done and car ready within 45 minutes. \n\nDiscount Tire, I am a lifelong customer!"
2,"On one hand, the Sea Life Aquarium is an aquarium. If you've seen one, you've seen this one. On the other hand, it's in a mall. That's right. An aquarium in a mall. I mean Concord Mills isn't your typical mall, so what did you expect? The attraction (they say that a lot) is run by a group that has a few of these - this is apparently the sixth in the US, and there are another couple of dozen scattered around Europe. So you may have seen them elsewhere, but this is the first in the area. The closest in the US is halfway across the country, so there's that.\n\nFirst, you buy your ticket. It's not cheap (though you can save a few bucks if you buy online, or if you buy an annual pass if you want to go a lot). Expect to spend a good percentage of $100 if you have a family of four - and well more than that if you hit up the souvenir shop on the way out.\n\nOn the way in, it's not unlike a Disney attraction - you get a little countdown timer, and cute animation and everything. Only the images aren't centered properly, so the porthole of your sub isn't exactly where it should be. Ignore that and pretend the room is moving, so you actually feel like you're in a submarine, so that when the doors open, you feel like you've moved, when in reality, you've gone nowhere. A bit more money in this department would do wonders. Even a visit to a Disney property would help explain why it's needed.\n\nRegardless, you then enter a cave-like aquarium, and the fish aren't bad. They say there are thousands of them, and there could be: But there aren't a huge variety. If you've been to the NC aquariums, you've seen otters and beluga whales and all sorts of wildlife. Not here. Just a bunch of fish. Even the touch tank only has a few starfish and some hermit crabs (admittedly, they are big hermit crabs). But you can see a bunch of those at Wings when you visit Myrtle Beach, it doesn't cost you anything, you can get your favorite team painted on the shell and if it dies you can usually get a free replacement.\n\nThere are a couple of nice displays - the horseshoe crabs are perhaps the most active I've seen anywhere, and they don't look dead (like they often do). The rays swim, rather than burying themselves. The blacklight display of jellyfish is cool to look at, but you can see things like that in Spencer Gifts (at least, I assume you can - perhaps I am dating myself). And the sea horses are always fun to watch. Perhaps the best display is near the end, where you can walk through a tunnel and see the head of Poseidon attached to some tentacles in some strange mythological mash-up. Most of the sharks were hanging out here, including the only hammerhead I saw the whole time.\n\nOne word of caution: The displays say not to use flash, which is fine because it usually reflects off the tanks. In fact, all of the plexiglass reflects horribly, so you get exit signs, display signs and the lady from Waukegan in your pictures. Try and take one looking up in the glass tunnel and you'll get nothing but LED lights and no detail on the fish because the lights are above you - in other words, pictures are almost a no-go here. But it is a reasonably interesting half-hour, especially if you have little ones.\n\nThat's right, I said half-hour. While it's a big place for the mall, it's not a big aquarium. You can stay about as long as you want, and you can cut through at the end to go back around again and again, but you probably won't stay very long overall. Keep that in mind, and understand what you're paying and you'll be fine."
0,Ghetto! No wi-fi and room service stops at 2pm!! Seriously disappointed. Jacuzzi didn't work right. Furniture was falling apart. Very sad hotel.
1,"Pre-renovation I was a huge fan on Tyber, and yes, due to it's proximity to my abode, it still gets more than one star, but taking out the games upstairs and replacing them with booths... not okay. \n\nThe food has always been decent (especially for midnight fare), the bartenders have always been great, but walking upstairs was a disaster. I never noticed a seating problem before, but apparently the owners did... oddly enough, the high tables were still busy as usual, but all of the booths sat empty. Only once the upstairs bathroom line grew too long did people start to occupy the nearest cushion. Also, instead of people being able to gravitate to a high top away from the stairwell like they used to, they were stuck standing right near the stairs (or the bathroom) and walking from one side of the upstairs to the other was more hassle than needed be. \n\nTyber has definitely dropped on my list of near-home stop ins, but on an off night where I think it'll be slow enough I don't have to head upstairs for a seat, I'll probably be back."
2,"I came here with Kelly C. after purchasing a Groupon to try this place out. It had really good reviews so I was excited to try a new painting. We are no strangers to BYOB instructor driven painting, so perusing a new calendar was fun. \n\nWe decided on the abstract painting, because it didn't look difficult and can be modified with the colors. Our class size was small, I think there were 9 of us, and everyone was really positive. I don't like it when people think too much about where things go, just have more wine, and paint! \n\nOur instructor, was ok. I can tell that she paints a lot in her free time. She told us that the picture wasn't meant to be put on the calendar, but the owner liked it so much. Because she painted it at home, I don't think she was thinking about just how she would teach the class. She had a bit of a difficult time explaining how she got to where she did at which point. She also didn't finish her painting, which was strange. \n\nOur class was very independent and didn't need to be coddled, but I just think it could have been more instructional. She was nice, and I liked the studio, I just don't think the teaching style is for me."
0,"If you like sausages, EDM and the smell of bleach, this place is for you! Trying way too hard to be swank in a town much better suited to chill lounge. The only good thing is that I discovered Ami's next door."
2,"Stopped in here for lunch with Mike C. today.  We split a Large \""Bull Durham\"" Pizza, which had salami, pepperoni, ham, sausage, beef, & Linquica.  There's a clean, simple decor, it's a little expensive, &  the pizza is very good!\n\nLg. Bull Durham Pizza (14\""), piled up good with everything above, $20.69.  (A 12\"" Medium at $17.09 would have been sufficient.)"
2,"Busy atmosphere and can be a bit of a wait. Food is decent enough and the price O.K.. \nI did find the most memorable thing about Big in Japan, was the service."
2,"This is more a 3.5ish?\n\nThe dessert selection is quite amazing :) Some are good, many--however--are not. I definitely recommend the mango-passionfruit mousse cup though, as well as the mini cheesecake! Their desserts are not too sweet, so for all you sweet-tooths out there...this may not be your type of dessert!\nI loved the vast selection of appetizers and the meats are always tender and delicious! \nOnly thing I don't like is the entire \""Asian foods\"" selection. Everything was either way too salty (curry clam), technically wrong (Asian banh mi does not look like that...), or just tasted really off/not Asian. \nOverall, there isn't a HUGE selection, but it's not too bad. I probably wouldn't come here again, but it's not bad for a buffet...but not quite up to par to the other Vegas buffets such as Wynn or Rio Seafood."
0,"We planned our trip late and El Monte Las Vegas was the only company with available RVs. In retrospect, a bad sign.  \n- Customer service: We waited 4 hours before anyone would acknowledge us about the RV we reserved. Others renters had been there more than 5 hours waiting to check out. While some of their team members are well intentioned, others sit around unwilling to talk to you unless your name is next on the list. Similarly, returning the RV took 1.5 hours. Add travel time to their location and El Monte ate an entire day of my vacation! \n- Hidden Charges: The RV pricing looks good on the web, but then EL Monte adds on numerous charges and set up fees. Worst of all: Their RVs don't come with bedding or kitchen supplies, but they'll rent these to you at exorbitant rates. For example, a set of pots and dishes that could be purchased for $40 at Walmart cost $125 a week to rent. A set of blankets and sheets for one person rents for $50!\n- Equipment: before we drove off the lot both the toilet and the cap to the fresh water tank needed to be fixed. In the case of the latter, a locking cap was replaced with a cap with no lock,  so potentially someone could access and pour anything into our freshwater tank.  Pretty unsafe. \nOn the road, the whole rig rattled and the engine whined up any incline. My kids named it \""the hunk of junk.\"" These RVs have been ridden hard.\n- My advice: book ahead somewhere (anywhere) other than El Monte, even if it's more expensive. In the end, you'll save money and your precious hours of vacation."
2,"Yuck! Shrimp Tacos not so good. Salsa not so good. Waitress was dumb as dirt. \n\nSan Felipe's looks like a fun place to grab a drink but I wouldn't eat here again! We came here on a double date last night and it seemed pretty busy for a Sunday night. The atmosphere is crazy. They made it look like a cheap bar in Mexico and there is all sorts of things hanging from the ceiling like sharks, inflatable bottles of Suaza, and pinatas. \nAs far as the food goes I knew it would interesting after I tasted the salsa. Our poor waitress didn't have a memory which made things interesting. More Chips? Sure twenty minutes later! Ketchup? Sure another twenty minutes. She was a sweet girl but it got really annoying."
0,"1. The place was filthy! the window we sat at had algae and/or mold over the entire surface. The ceiling had water damage and had been spottily fixed. (Imagine what you can not see.) \n2. From the time we ordered the soup and salad portion took 40 minutes. Dinner was far over 60 minutes. \n3. We had to get up and find someone to get our drinks refilled for just water and tea. 4. The appetizer orders were half wrong. \n5. One dinner order was wrong. No manager came to talk to us or apologize for a thing. \n6. Potatoes came without sour cream..others came without butter. (which never came)\n7. Staff was not at all friendly or nice. They kept saying they were extremely busy but the dining room had only two tables with customers.....and there were more than 5 servers with at least two boys for busing, so I have no idea what they do when actually busy. \n\nIf you are looking for a nice marina atmosphere try Red Fin Blues Instead. SKIP THIS PLACE COMPLETELY!"
1,"This place has the potential to be great!!!  The new menu items sounds so yummy, but it just doesn't deliver.  Its bland bland bland.  Tastes like a frozen meal i could just heat in microwave.  My pesto pasta with chicken was such a disappointment--my husbands spaghetti was bland as well.  The the price of entrees, the nice atmosphere, the friendly service--why isn't the food better?  Save your money and make pasta at home."
1,"Due to unfortunate events at this gym, I am highly disappointed in the unprofessional goings on that have occurred here. I am satisfied with the way I was treated here but after careful consideration, I will seldom be using this facility.  Thanks for the memories and great friends but I am disappointed that one of the best trainers is leaving here."
0,"Dr. Camp is unprofessional, money-hungry and does not care about patients or their conditions."
1,"Service is spotty, we had a bartender reading a book about juicing while out drinks sat empty but another bartender when he wasn't on break was fabulous.\n\nDrink prices are high, as expected.\n\nWe ordered french fries which were alright but nothing to write home about."
1,"Pretty old crowd in here, but all the women here were gorgeous. The drinks were pretty good, but a little expensive, but i'am in phx so i guess i should expect it to be a coastly night. I guess I was jst looking for a place to kick back and relax and I found hat hard to do with the older crowd and all the men in suite's. Maybe I'll try this place on a friday or saturday next time. This was posted on yelp events I didn't see many people taking pictures of the place and didn't feel that I should take a lot of pictures in there last night. I think I took one, and I didn't get a chance to play bouchey ball. bummer."
0,"While the concept is great and the eyeshadow selection rivals other great makeup brands, the lack of service really turned me off. My niece introduced me to Inglot as we share a love for great makeup. Once inside the store, she was being helped by a salesperson with vibrant wine-colored hair. I was very intrigued with some of the sample sets on the wall and asked her which colors were the ones in certain sets b/c I wanted to get them. She replied that I had to just figure them out. Ummmm .... ok. No help ... Whatsoever. Instead of leaving with sets of cool new makeup, I walked out empty-handed."
1,"OMG - I hate writing this review for I've heard so much about this place!  We've been meaning to check out this place since it opened especially since the Roosevelt had closed.  We had family visiting over the long Columbus Day holiday and needed a night out with just the two of us especially since it was my birthday!  We even left Grandpa at home to try this place by ourselves!  When we arrived we walked into a \""please seat yourself sign.\""  Hard to \""seat yourself\"" when the place is packed.  We finally was offered a table at the back per a group who graciously gave up their table for friends who were a no show.  This was a table with a perfect window view of behind the scenes of the keg taps.  We waited about 12 minutes or so before a \""waiter\"" felt bad for us to ask if we had ordered yet.  We asked for a drink menu only to be told we should have either looked at it on the way in or take a step outside to see it!  We told him what we wanted to drink and he said he would do the best to match our needs.  We get our drinks and the menu looked good and we figured out what we wanted to order but then another 15 minutes went by without any waiter attention and we decided to head off to another local place that we knew we would get better service.  We were forced to simply leave a $10 bill on the table for no one every came back to check on us and we promptly made our way to the door!!!!  I don't think we will be making our way back here anytime soon, we really should give this place a 1/2 star but we liked what they did with the place ;o)."
1,"I hadn't been to a Macaroni Grill in a number of years. I most likely won't be back to one for a very long time. Unlike other reviews, the service was actually very good, except for the copious amount of perfume our waitress bathed in. Very off-putting when so much of taste depends on smell. The food came out quickly but was still warm at best. I got the chicken scallopini and it was ok, other than the lack of heat. My wife got Mama's Trio. She didn't really care for any of it. I tried it and agree that none of it was very good, and also lukewarm.  The saving grace was that was that we had a gift card and didn't have to waste too much of our own money. If there is a next time, we'll re-gift it."
4,My girlfriend had to drag me there Because I did not want to go to the palace station for seafood. Boy did I eat my words... It was awesome the food was amazing and cooked fresh to order. Not only was the food great but so was the service big thumbs up to Steve and Ricardo.
3,"Great food, good atmosphere, just a little bit pretentious."
4,"What a surprise THIS place turned out to be! My friend Brion and I were meeting for breakfast, and since he's from Vegas, he was picking. Well, the place HE picked wasn't open at 5am (which was when we were meeting) so I suggested the Kopper Keg because it was almost right across the street from where I'd just made a delivery, and it looked \""Open\"". \n\nI parked my truck around back (lots of parking at 5am!) and he parked right in front of the door. Perfect.\n\nVery quickly we were greeted my Sarah, a happy, friendly, and quick to laugh young lady who actually seemed to like her job. We got menus and made our selections. \n\nI opted for the Corned Beef Hash with eggs and toast. Oh, and country fries with it as well. Not sure what Brion ordered, but it was BIG, and he wolfed it all down.\n\nWhen my selection came, it was PERFECT! The hash was crispy through and through (just as I'd ordered), and my fries were also well crisped - as I ordered. I'm liking this place already! \n\nThis is a classy looking sports bar. There's TV's everywhere, so no matter where you sit you can see several. Each one has something else showing (football, tennis, golf, auto racing, baseball - you name it). I wish I lived near a place like this. I'd go broke hanging out there. It looks like it's a lot of fun in the evenings when the place is packed. But for our casual, intimate breakfast it was fine. We had a few years of tales to catch up on. \n\nSarah made her presence known just often enough to refill coffee cups and water glasses. \n\nThe menu looks fairly well represented by all sorts of options. I think if you can't find something here to eat, you should just quit eating..."
3,A bit pricey but the subs are so delicious it is hard to resist. I wouldn't say we are regulars but we return every once in awhile.
1,"I heard so many wonderful things about the Wicked Spoon, so when I finally tried it, I was incredibly disappointed.\n\nWe went at 10:30 on a weekday. No line whatsoever. Was it our timing? I don't know. All I know is that the hot food I put on my plate was already cold when I sat down. I should've done what the husband did: get a made-to-order omelette. By that time, though, I was no longer interested in any more savory food. Cold, tough potatoes and a cold, flavorless eggs benedict will do that to you.\n\nAt least the desserts were good. The chocolate covered strawberries were excellent.\n\nThe hype, and the $26 price tag for brunch, set my expectations pretty high. I was pretty cranky- and not close to full- when I walked out of there. Unless someone else is buying, I won't be back."
1,"While vacationing in Vegas, we decided to come here for our last meal before making the 12 hour journey back home.\n\nIt was Christmas day, and Ihop was very very packed.. we waited for 20 mins to be seated. Ok, understandable. \n\nWhat was not understandable was we had to wait another 10 mins to even get greeted. Someone came to our table and said, \"" what would you guys like to drink?\"" \nWe politely answered \""water\"" and let him know we were ready to order. He said, \""Well I'm actually off work and just helping [insert name here]. She's the one that will be taking your order.\"" Okay, whatever.. \n\nAnother 5 minute wait, and [insert name here arrives]. She takes our order, and we're good.. or so I thought.\n\nChris points out that none of the tables in our section have their food. Red Flag.. we really should have left right there and then. They were here first and that meant they would get served first before us.\n\nNeedless to say, the guy that was off work already helped our server, thus making it a somewhat faster process. We did get free oj, compliments from our server, which was nice. Food was good. We quickly ate our food and headed back to our hotel room. Just in time for check-out. \n\nSince we did go during a busy period, I do not know if this is how slow it usually is. I did read other reviews, and apparently they are slow. Only suggestion/ tip I would give is, do not come here if you are on a time crunch. You will probably be late to your appointment"
3,"Probably one of the \""hidden gems\"" in Charlotte, I discovered Wing Haven during a Bike!Charlotte Bingo Bike Ride on a nice Saturday afternoon.  The bike loop started at SouthEnd and cut through downtown/Noda/Plaza Midwood/the greenway and led us to Wing Haven.  \n\nI have lived in Charlotte for 17 years now and this was the first time I had ever heard of Wing Haven.  It's really tucked inside the middle of a neighborhood street - almost inbetween the Dilworth and Sewlyn areas.  I'm sure the houses that surround Wing Haven are used to the business being there but the \""NO WING HAVEN\"" parking signs our in front of people's yards give me a good sense that this place can draw a crowd when it wants to.\n\nIf you are a bird lover, outdoor lover, or unique place lover... this is definitely a good spot.  I think you can rent out the space for small events and there are plenty of activities for small children to do and see."
4,"I come here often for lunch and dinner, and love all the vegan options. The Crazy Pita salad and Mediterranean Salad are both great, and their hummus with whole wheat pita is delish. Crazy Pita is great!"
1,"I'm a Chicago native living in Vegas for a while now and I get the usual cravings for Chicago food.\n\nI was in the mood for hot dogs tonight so I decided to try Tasty Dogs for the first time. \n\nI've read the other reviews here and I really wanted this place to be great, but unfortunately it didn't live up to them.\n\nAlthough they had all the right ingredients, Vienna beef dogs, neon green relish, poppy seed buns, sport peppers, etc, the final dogs served to me were pretty sub par.\n\nFirst- one of the buns had a stale end- like the end was hanging out of the package and dried up. How do you serve a customer a rock hard bun? Next they really skimp on the toppings, Two TINY slices of tomato (seriously looked like they sliced a cherry tomato as thin as possible. A pickle spear on the dog looked like it was shaved off the pickle with a vegetable peeler. Then just a bare minimum of the other toppings covered the dog.\n\nI understand this stuff is mostly all shipped in from Chicago and it's expensive, but I'm paying a premium- the 2 dog special is $8.99 + tax!!! For that kind of money, give me a decent topped dog on a fresh bun! I felt pretty gypped.\n\nThe one good thing I can mention are the hand cut thin fries- very tasty.\n\nI may go back and try the gyros and Italian beef and hope it gets made with a little more care. Maybe I just had an unusual bad experience."
2,"Aaaaahhhhhhhh! I walked into this place happy, and instantly turned into hipster emo girl. what is going on? The music is really sad and there are a lot of flies around. Get me outta here. The coffee and treats are always good though."
1,My wife and I stopped here for a quick bite while we were in Mesa just for the night.  I ordered the fish tacos and a Birria taco.  My wife ordered the green chili pork burrito.  None of them tasted that good...compared to many similar taco joints I've been to in the past.  The fish tacos for instance simply had way too much stuff on top which made it difficult to eat.  Sorry this was a miss for us however I do give them at least 2 stars for packaging everything so nicely on our to-go order.
1,"Kitschy name, cute concept, a little indie place in an area consumed by monolithic chains -- Oink really had all the potential in the world. \n\nThe space is simple, open, and clean, although very sparse --  what some may interpret as modern simply reeked of half-assedness to me. \""Hey, let's throw some pink paint on one wall and call it a day!\"" The bathrooms had fancy schmancy modern sinks and fixtures, although the weekly cleaning form on the back of the door was, disconcertingly, completely blank.\n\nThe service was super average, better than I expected considering I had heard it was atrocious. My breakfast-loving SO and I did our usual, each of us getting our own separate egg things followed by a shared short stack of blueberry pancakes. My omelet was nice, steaming hot and full of nice fresh veggies. The home fries on the side, though, were cold. The English muffin was barely toasted, also cold, and so slathered in butter it was slippery. My SO inhaled most of his Hollandaise-slathered Benedict, but let's face it, he'd slurp down a dog turd if it was drenched in Hollandaise. The pancakes were completely and utterly unremarkable, as was the OJ (watery and bitter) and coffee. \n\nThe sucker punch was the bill: with tip, over $40 for two for breakfast. If I wanted to shell out $40 for breakfast, I would stay in my own hood and go to Taylor's where I know the food will be spectacular and the service top-notch. Alternatively, I could go to IHOP across the street, where I know the food will be reliably above average for half the price.\n\nSorry, Oink, your prices make you little piggies. You've gotta step up your game, because no one wants to pay Paradise Valley prices for a Glendale experience."
4,"Best Happy hour in pittsburgh! I went before going on a gallery crawl. They have an array of specialty cocktails \""half price\"" 5-7pm and Tapas. I enjoyed the Caparrhina, a glass of full bodied pinot noir, and a green tea martini. So refreshing. My BF and I split several appetizers too. Empanadas, Ceviche, Tuna tartar, grilled skewers, duck quesadilla, crabcake, and the filo shrimp. We just wanted to try everything. \n\nThere are still many I saw come out of the kitchen that I am dying to try. The presentation was lovely. I probably won't get the ceviche or grilled skewers again because there are other more interesting dishes that suit my tastes better. I think it's a very nice addition to the variety of restaurants in Pittsburgh. Eat, Drink, Enjoy!"
4,"I visited today to try out the weekend special on key lime tres leches. Let me just say,  mmm mmm mmm! Since I can stop by on my lunch hour, I have managed to try some of the other tres leches flavors offered here since they opened, but the key lime is my favorite so far. I hope everyone can make it in to try it out before they sell out. Perfect variation on a classic dessert like key lime pie. Can't wait to see what they come up with next!"
1,"El Toro is not horrible, but its not great Mexican either. Don't let this reflect on  Wedge. There are no better margaritas in CU than Wedge's. \n\nWe got nachos and a chicken verde quesadilla. The nachos had cheese sauce instead of cheese. Not our thing, but the sour cream and guac were super fresh so that made up for it. The quesadilla was soggy and wet and lacking cheese. I didn't hate it but my boyfriend wouldn't take a second bite. \n\nOverall it's acceptable, but there are better Mexican places if you look elsewhere."
4,Posh is one of the coolest restaurants I have experienced.  The menu consists of all the protein they have available that day and you get to mark off what you do not like.  The number of courses depends on how much you would like to spend.  This place is so fun because you really have no idea what you are going to get.  I had the most amazing scallop app and short rib entree. I would highly recommend this place.
0,"Just about the worst event I could imagine.  My brother and his wife were in town and I was embarrassed to have taken them to an event like this.  I also treated a chef friend of mine to it - and even though he didn't pay for his ticket I was also sorry to have brought him as well.  \nI'll just quickly rehash all the issues.\n\n1) Lines were way too long.  You stood in line for 30-60 minutes at a time for, at most, a few bites of food.\n2) The food, when you got it, wasn't good.  There were some standouts but most of the places served terrible food.  Even great places I know like Raku dipped their meat in a bucket of teriyaki sauce.\n3) Special shout out to Jet Tila and Eddie Huang for perhaps the worst experience of the night.  Subjected to a long line while the chefs and his buddies took time out to booze it up, spend minutes at a time talking to who knows whom, and the chef himself light heartedly but LOUDLY chastising one of his cooks for apologizing for the wait with this gem - \""Hey man, don't ever apologize for how long it takes to produce art.\""  Art being dry, terrible bao bun, an overcooked pork belly, and over sauced short rib in the taco.  I mean, they DRENCHED that taco in sauce.  And the sauce was gross.  I guess the tortilla for the taco was fine though.  :)  I had to give a special shout out to those jackasses.  Because their food is nowhere near good enough to have that kind of ego.  \n4) Many of the vendors closed TWO HOURS before the event ended.  What?!  \n\nI like the idea.  And I would give it another chance.  But triple the number of vendors or don't put it on groupon and keep the number of people down.  It was absolutely ridiculous.\n\nI will give a positive, not sarcastic, shoutout to Shirley Chung of China Poblano.  That sandwich and those ribs were delicious!"
4,"First time at this hotel and I love it here! Rooms are nice, hotel Is nice, no smoke smell, 24/7 Starbucks in lobby, got a cab right Away and most importantly they are pet friendly:)  walking distance to battistas yummy Italian restaurant.  Also walking distance to the strip.  Across the way from ballys hotel. Ill def stay here for future trips!"
2,Why do I remember Gyro Time as being the place to go? What has happened to the Gyro Time I remember on West Charleston that at this location is missing? Well for one no one is slicing your gyro meat anymore...microwaved? Is that what I saw? Anyway the place was clean....so clean that they at 2:00pm on Saturday afternoon they were scrubbing and mopping the floors with wet soapy (bleachy) water as food was being prepared and a place full of patrons. Not something I wanna hear or see when my food is being prepared. It must be nostalgia I remember - not the gyros. Easily forgettable.
1,"Stopped in for a drink before a show at the Carnegie Music Hall. Was hit by a wall of vomit/sewer aroma when we walked in the door. Horrible, never fully went away (the bathrooms smelled better than the main room). As a result, did not try the food. Decent beer list, and enjoyed the dark & stormy. But not worth a special trip & not worthy of the Chiodo legacy/standard for dives in Homestead."
1,"I have no idea how this place has so many good ratings - even from people with many reviews.  I've driven by here many times and knew from my Yelp app it had good ratings.  However, I was a little hesitant to come here because most of the people whose reviews I follow and deem reliable did not give this place a good rating.  Should have listened to them.  \n\nBasically, the food is not very good.  It's NOT bad...but it's not even average for a breakfast place.\n\nI had country fried steak and eggs.  The eggs were too runny (ordered over medium) and the CFS was just bad.  Bland, tough, and the gravy served on top was really thick and useless.  It was small, too.  Came with a biscuit -  bland, chewy, and dense.  \n\nI'm not accusing the folks who run Norms of successfully manipulating people into giving it a high rating.  I have no proof of that.  But, yeah, that's what they did.  I'd bet plenty of dough on it.  Good for them, I guess.\n\nThere's literally 30+ places within 10 minute drive from here that are loads better for breakfast.  And the price isn't really cheap, either.  Looks like they raised prices above what they used to be.\n\nI really feel like giving this 1 star for the fact that so many reviews from before were not accurate or biased.  But I don't know for sure so I'll give it a deuce."
0,"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. The food was terrible, if you like something like church's chicken  you might approve. We ordered the prawn appetizer; there were 3 1/2 sized  prawns fried and skewered sitting on a GREASY OIL SOAKED napkin with a mayonnaise based dipping sauce on the side....happy hour priced @ $9.00. The 2nd  appetizer was their cieviche of which ive seen similar representation in the deli department at Albertsons.....not impressive at all, and it was served in a 4oz mason jar with crackers laid out on a plate like Grandma would serve, also $9.00 happy hour priced.  Eeeeeek! The drinks were also unimpressive, the dirty martini had oils floating on top and the supposed blue cheese olive was a creamy cheap imitation  @ $15.00 ea including the tax! We had to ask the waiter twice for napkins, by the time he brought them we had finished the 3 measly greasy shrimp! Sadly, the best part of the outing were the mints at the door on the way out. Never, never, never! What a gigantic disappointment!"
3,Fast service.  Ordered extra crispy chicken.  The food was good as usual.  Will come back again.
1,"I've been here about 4 times. \nI think 3 out of 4 of those visits were negative. \n\nThe rapidity of the service is totally non-consistent. Sometimes the food takes too long and other times the waiter/tress never stops by. At one visit, for myself and my neighbor our sausages were extremely cold. It was embarrassing for everyone, and all they did was take our plates as they were and changed the sausages to fresh ones. \n\nThe smoothies are totally w-e-a-k. It's not real fruit they use in there. It's thick frozen mud. Not authentic at all.\n\nTHE MENU IS MESSED UP ALSO. For breakfast, on the eggs page it says at the top: Includes toast, potatoes - showing it at the top that all of them come with those extras, then you get your plate with nothing?! So you ask and they say \""Oh the menu is like that, but with this plate those are not included.\""\n\nLike, what the HECK is that?!"
3,"So Miquel's is definitely a perfect definition for a \""Hole in the Wall\"" but let's be honest those places clearly have the best food. \n\nAs a self proclaimed Mexican fanatic I was excited to see just what this place had to offer. \n\nWe started with the chips and salsa and they were classic. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa had just the right amount of kick! \n\nMy friends and I ordered a little bit of everything...fajitas, shrimp quesadillas, tacos, rice and beans. \n\nEverything was delicious...and the portion sizes were perfect! Add to that good service and super reasonable prices! I'm absolutely coming back."
2,"Three stars for kabuki. \n\nFood: 5 stars- Excellent rolls , and i must recommend the sunkist roll's , which are specialty rolls. They are California rolls with raw tuna over the top and some sort of delicious sauce. Also, the Philly rolls are amazing. They also give you edamame beans, which are tasty ! \n\nPrice: 4  stars - So, in comparison to likes of Ra sushi, Kabuki's price's are amazing. Regular rolls are 4-6 dollars for 6-8 rolls and around 9 dollars for 6 specialty rolls. \n\nAtmosphere: 4 stars- The restaurant is decorated in a modern, and artistic fashion. \n\nService: 2 stars- The servers at Kabuki are not attentive what so ever, once they get your order it seems like simply forever until you finally receive your food. Once, you finally do they will not give you the time of day from there on out. In fact, one time our server completely deserted us and a different server came and brought us our check. They never even asked how the food was. They spend more time talking to each other then tending to the customers."
0,"DO NOT use this pharmacy!  These people are incompetent, especially the \""manager\"" Jerry who does not even return customer phone calls.  It has been 3 days and many, many phone calls and I still do not have my Rx.  I will never use this pharmacy again.  Don't waste your time...find a different compounding pharmacy!"
0,"Called us on Father's Day, an hour before our reservation, to tell us they were going out of business!  Horrible!"
1,"Blah. Stayed here over Illinois Homecoming weekend, and with my friend's wedding block rate it was still ~$90/night. The room was moderately okay upon first sight...but then things just started going downhill. There were cigarette burns on our blankets, a shower that looked like it had been pulled from a foreclosed doublewide and, much to my chagrin after realizing I had forgotten mine, NO HAIR DRYER. That made for a pleasant morning of tailgating in late October. \n\nThings didn't really get bad until the day we checked out and I noticed I had some sort of rash on my torso and legs. Are. You. Kidding. After Googling bed bugs for about 20 minutes I got an email asking to fill out a survey about my stay and was not very polite. Thankfully, I got an email from the manager shortly after who wanted to \""make things right\"" and ended up cutting my bill in half.\n\nSo....good customer service after the fact...not so great hotel stay. Never again. Until next year, that is, when I'm scrambling for Homecoming weekend accommodations without a wedding discount."
3,"This restaurant is so good! I love the Teriyaki Chicken and rice dinner. The only reason I give this restaurant four stars is because it is always so busy. They don't offer call ahead seating and don't do reservations, so the wait can be long. It's definitely a good place to eat though! Sit out front so you can see the statue show and aquarium!"
2,"It was my first time here and I brought some friends. I was really excited about the meal since I've always heard great things about it and thought this would be a great time to try it out during Restaurant Week but that excitement fell by the wayside as the night progressed.\n\nWell, the food was \""ok\"". Despite my friend's duck being a bit on the dry side and the soup being served in bowls that were too wide which made them cool off faster than they could be eaten, it was decent.  The ambiance is pleasant and definitely romantic.  \n\nService wise... definitely left room for improvement.\n\n1) Some of our dishes were taken while we were still eating.\n2) On more than one occasion we had to ask for more water.\n3) When announcing the food the waiters were presenting, some forgot the descriptions. Not a super big deal but if you're going to open your mouth to announce what is in the dish, shouldn't you remember what is in it?\n4) There was a 30 minute wait between the appetizer and the first course\n5) The servers chimed into our party's conversation unexpectedly. This is something I'd expect of Dennys, not Quiessence.\n\nIf you go here for dinner, bring a flashlight for the parking lot and the walk through the courtyard to the restaurant.  An older couple I saw leaving almost couldn't find their way through the courtyard and I was a bit worried one of them might fall.  Considering the rough terrain, you'd think they'd light up the pathway a bit more."
1,"The following is a precautionary tale.\n\nAs I was eating, I started to think about what I would write as a review. And it was going to be pretty good, you know... for the money that is. It's cheap for an all you can eat setting. \n\nEverything was going well until I went to the bathroom. And I found myself face to face with the two dirtiest crustiest urinals I have ever witnessed in a restaurant. Let's get something straight right off the bat, they don't clean here. If they're not cleaning the bathroom (something we can see) what makes you think they're cleaning the kitchen?\n\nA fellow Yelper mentions that the Kanda on Bishop has failed multiple food safety inspections.\n\nI even took a picture, and I considered posting it. But this isn't the place, you'll have to take my word for it."
0,"Just wanted to have some decent chinese food this weekend nothing too authentic because it's not available in town. So Pf Chang's right? Wrong. Steam rice was dry,\nOrange chicken not on the menu, sweet & sour pork was not crunchy and something new on the menu, Curry noodles of some sort not so delicious. My kids were hungry so didn't even bother to complain just ate really fast. Been to pf Chang's a lot but what is going on?"
4,"This is my favorite place to stay in Vegas!! The suites are amazing!! Very clean and quiet rooms, spacious with spa tubs, shower, vanity, gorgeous view, and bathrobes and slippers. Best pools in Vegas, with outdoor running path, plus spa, restaurants, etc. Fabulous customer service and prices are reasonable for such a nice hotel. Tram is available for transportation to other hotels which makes it so much easier than constantly paying for taxi. Love, love this place!!"
0,"Great products. Worst customer service ever. My diabetic mother,my aunt and i were called liars. We were told we had been in earlier when none of us had ever been in the store! If you want to get treated crappy go to this store otherwise buy overpriced cosmetics elsewhere. If i could rate this store negative stars i would. Never again"
1,"I've only been here once after work one night, and the experience wasn't too good.\n\nI remember ordering some kind of burger with a side salad. The salad was very delicious, the best part of the whole meal. I don't remember much about the burger. That kinda says this place is forgetful.\n\nI also believe that the pricing here is pretty ridiculous. That's the main reason why we haven't gone back for such a long time. Maybe we will in the future.\n\nThe customer service also sucked the last time we were there. The lady that helped us was rude, and the decor is not too flattering either. It needs to be updated."
3,"Well I've stayed at a few hotels since I've been in Vegas for a couple of months and the Downtown Grand isn't bad at all. It has a very retro feel to it with the ocean scenic colors. It also has some very modern furniture that I would not expect for the cost of the room. Flat screen tv, full size closet/cabinet and dresser draws. Basically everything you need except for a refrigerator...\n\nThe biggest dislikes I have is all those hidden fees. They say free internet but I believe that's part of the hidden $12 daily hotel fee that they failed to mention. Also there's a $50 a day hold for damages if need be. Also if you opt to park across the street at the self parking, be prepared to look over your shoulder in that spooky garage.  \n\nAll in all not bad for it to be downtown Vegas. The restaurants in the lobby are what I consider on par with the rest of the Grand experience."
4,"$10 for a mimosa and brunch. Breakfast sandwich: bacon cooked perfectly crispy, the blend of guacamole and applewood smoked bacon is a true pleasure. The perfect breakfast treat!  The steak and eggs was a larger portion than expected and the chimichurri sauce was the perfect accompaniment. I'm surprised it was not more busy! They have a dog friendly back patio. Honestly, how amazing is that? The service was attentive and the options of beers is impressive. You must try as many as you can before you commit to one. \n\nIt's a must try. If I lived in town if be here every Sunday."
0,"I'm sitting in my car waiting for a pizza that was promised 15 minutes ago.  Hope it's good because a second chance is unlikely.  Called 45 minutes ahead for a good 'za to take home for movie night, waited until they told me it would be ready and here I sit.\nThe pizza finally comes with appropriate apologies.\nCan't argue about the quality of the pie: Schreiner's sausage, tasty mushrooms, MJ crust  - all good - but it's a pizza.  You shouldn't have to wait at the pickup window longer than it takes to make the pizza from scratch.  \nEven the best food tastes bitter after a bad experience with service."
1,"Don't eat anything but the chicken. Everything else is nasty. Charlotte should be a BBQ mecca, it isn't because of the chains. Go back to Florida, they like it there."
4,"Came here due to the numerous 4/5 star reviews! I had to come here to try it myself plus who doesn't eat sandwiches?\n\nFound in the Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino, there sat a crowd of people and a line in front of the register awaiting their turn.. I was thinking, are you serious? Dude, there's like a ton of other places to grab something to eat, are these all yelp people here? haha! Whatever, I would of waited an hour to try this place.\n\nThe breakdown:\n\nFull Montagu: great combination of quality meat, veggies tasted fresh, bread wasn't the normal subway style bread I was expecting but it was soft and delicious.\n\nHoliday Turkey: I almost cried after eating this!! You know the \""Bobbie\"" sandwich from Capriotti's?.. Well, this is similar but to the 10th degree!! This sandwich was out of control! The turkey meat soft and juicy and cranberry filling was sweet and mouth watering!.. It really is indescribable, try it yourself.. I think its only available for a limited time, don't miss out.. Trust me\n\nTuna Melt: Unbelieveably Fluffy and another Jackpot Sandwich that I don't have words to describe. One of the Best Tuna Melts I've ever had! And I love Tuna Melts and have tried many different ones..\n\nBest BLT: Bold name for this sandwich, which does taste how it should. You really can't go wrong with bacon, lettuce and tomato. Nothing special though.\n\nMeatball: A little salty for my taste but nevertheless it was good. I love meatball sandwiches and I've tried many others better than this. \n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nHOLIDAY TURKEY = 6/5 Stars\nTUNA MELT = 6/5 Stars\nFULL MONTAGU = 4.5/5 Stars"
3,Best beer selection in Champaign. Cool atmosphere too.
4,"Best meat in town! The delmonico is a cut you can't possibly go wrong with. They also have great pork products and sausages. Everytime we go in, we immediately put the delmonico on our list along with rib eyes and/or ny strips. Chicken and a brisket are the next things on my list to try from there. \nThe staff is always friendly and willing to help. If you have questions on cuts, they will fully explain what is best for your recipe intentions. \nThe place is always clean and never smells like, well, meat. There is absolutely no smell to this place which makes me feel that it is top quality. Good quality meat should not have a smell. \nTheir frozen section has a few random things that you should def try out. Game hen, buffalo, other gamey meat. Give it a try! \nTheir shop also has some great sauce and spice accompanyments for your grilling and marinating pleasures. \nThis place is definitely top notch in my book and I am a meat snob. (part of the family ranches angus up north, so I like to think I have good taste ;)  )"
1,Not very good.  I had the salmon and the BBQ wasn't very good.  The veggies were supposed to be grilled but didn't appear to be.  My father had the ultimate fajita which included pulled pork.  We've never been to a Mexican restaurant that had that in it.  He was also disappointed with his food.  On the plus side the staff is friendly.
3,"We were looking for a totally different resto to lunch at in Old Montreal when we accidentally walked by this charming little restaurant. We were warmly greeted and shown to a great little table looking out onto the cobblestone street and it's occasional passing horse-drawn carriage. It was all very touristy, but in the best sense possible.\nHaving heard that Polish food tended toward heaviness we carefully chose our lunch portion to match our appetite.  I had the tripe soup (Flaki)  and an entree level order of pierogies whereas the Missus had Barszcz and Kielbasa - their typical beet soup and sausage meal.\nThe honeycomb tripe's texture was OMG wonderful, as was the hearty broth. The pierogies were completely unexpected. They were delicate little pouches, their translucent skins glistening and  hinting at the promise of meaty yummy goodness. A dollop of sour cream just sent the meal over the top. I almost started planning a trip to Poland solely on the strength of these nibbles it was that good.\n\nI think that the Missus's meal met her standards because she wouldn't share any of her dishes with me. For shame, Missus, for shame! ;-)"
2,"Small but decent downtown farmers market- a major pluses are that this one is indoors AND parking is free and easy to find on-site.\n\nThree different product booths were present, along with two food trucks (Rika Arepa Express and 50 Shades of Green), a coffee shop, live music, and a handful of artisans selling jewelry and kitchen supplies.\n\nInterested to see whether this market garners more participants in the fall."
4,Best croissance that's all u gotta say.....
4,"Yes, this is a car dealership, however, to make a long story short I needed a car.\nI've had a Volvo in the past and thoroughly loved it.\nI was totally freaked out about having to go car shopping for the first time without a guy there who knows more about this stuff.  Being a woman I figured they would totally take advantage of me. I knew what I wanted to put down and I knew what I wanted my payments to be.  I don't remember who the sales manager was (I'm sure it's on my paperwork).  Anyway, I fell in love with a gorgeous 2011 C70 which was in my price range.\nVolvo of Tempe made it work.  It was totally painless and I was on cloud 9 for weeks.\nI still love my car  and I still think of Volvo of Tempe often and how amazing they are.\nI'd recommend them to everyone."
0,"This Rosati's is not listed as one of the franchises on their website. I ordered chicken strips from the appetizer menu and received processed frozen chicken strips. I have had better frozen strips from the grocery store!\n\nThe pizza is disgusting and tastes nothing like a Rosati's pizza should. Being the only delivery company in Gold Canyon, you think that they would want to have the best quality. I would not recommend this place to anyone who actually wants to eat a good meal. If I could score it a zero I would!"
1,If you like more head in your Guinness than beer than this is the place for you. Not impressed with this venue whatsoever! We bought tickets to the 8 pm flogging Molly show on 3/15/14 and they didn't even open the doors until about 10 after 8. Went to the the bar to get the most horrible poured Guinness and a Cosmo where we paid $40.00!!!!!! We about fell on the floor. Here we are 9:55 and still no flogging Molly so we left. This place is a total rip off! We will not be going back.
4,Friendly staff and I come here for the $5 gyro sandwich lunch special. Someone else ordered meatball and pasta and has been very content.
2,Banana Shake and Seasoned Fries. \n\nStick with that and you are good to go!
1,"Sanctum is memorable but not my cup of tea. I liked the music but it is too loud to have a conversation. The venue was very hypnotic but also impersonal. \n\nThe dance floor is too small to do anything but free-style but that doesn't matter because nobody there seems to know how to dance -- and they don't care anyway. The point of dancing at the Sanctum is to wriggle for hours to the unending techno beat. The interior is dark with flashy strobe lights, which gives anonymity to everyone there. It's great for people who are self conscious because people flash in and out of our universe into different dimensions.\n\nI don't know how people manage to hook up there but I'm sure they find ways to do it. It proves that you don't need conversation to procreate. Sexual pre.ference makes no difference at Sanctum as there are all manner of persuasions that come there. \n\nI enjoyed sitting in the stadium seating to watch two lesbians who put on a stunning duet of free style dancing. Their sexuality felt very liberating.\n\nRestrooms are cool and the gothic art is worth seeing at least once.\n\nI had a drink that was spiked with plenty of alcohol. I have read many reviews saying the drinks were watered down but based on my sample of one they are strong enough to get the job done.\n\nDon't forget to take your ecstacy before you come."
2,"I've been to Max Brenner's in NY before...not to eat, but just to check out the gift shop and goodies. It is one cool place to visit that's for sure and the chocolate gift shop is pretty awesome...especially those chocolate syringes :P The vegas location isn't as big as the NY one, but still a pretty restaurant, which isn't surprising because it is in the Caesar forum shops. To be honest, I like chocolate, but an excessive amount of chocolate just seems a little to saccharine for me. And that's kind of what it feels like in Max Brenner's. Like you're Augustus Gloop drowning in Mr. Wonka's chocolate river.\n\nSo we tried the famous \""Chocolate pizza\"" that this place is known for. And it really wasn't anything too special. The crust was kinda...meh. Like the edges of a pop tart that no one really likes to eat because it's so bland. That's what I thought the crust tasted like. We got the works, which is every thing on top...so marshmallows, chocolate, peanut butter, drizzled caramel...basically ingredients of your favorite chocolate bars laid out on a pop tart crust for you to cavitate your teeth and be your dentist's dream come true. And it was just okay...I felt like I could have made that at home if I really wanted to. Key word = if. \n\nWhat was partially redeeming were the banana split waffles. This was actually pretty delicious and it even came with a cute little mini beaker/flask of chocolate syrup to drizzle to your delight over caramelized bananas atop vanilla ice cream and mini waffles. Plus a little bowl of those crunchy rice krispy-like chocolate balls. Mm...this was sweet but balanced well with the bananas and vanilla ice cream. \n\nOne of my friends also got a burger which actually looked quite delicious. (He attests to this) we munch on some of his waffle fries which were also good...and hey, if you did want to grab a bite of real food and not diabetes, you could still try their menu for other food! The server was really nice and overall, it was still a fun experience. I probably would come back for the banana split waffles (to split with friends of course) but everything else on the menu seemed just a little too chocolate-y for me. But if you're a huge chocolate fanatic, by all means, this is probably the place for you!"
1,"Pretty disappointing. I was curious about what the Linq had to offer, and if this is it, I am concerned. \nWe went on a Saturday night and although bowling was advertised outside, we were unable to even enter the bowling area- it looked like a group had rented it out. There was ample seating around the bars, which was nice, but the drinks were expensive and mediocre at best. In fact, the mojito crossed from mediocre to un-drinkable. For those prices I would rather go next door to Yardhouse where there is a far better drink selection, not to mention some yummy appetizers."
1,"I wish I continued reading more reviews instead of just the first 3 and looking at the pictures.\n\nFirst I'll say is the wait was wayy too long.  We came into this place for a breakfast before we went to our volunteering event, and the wait for our food really made us pushing it to get there on time, not to mention the fact that we had to send our food back because it wasn't thoroughly cooked,\n\nNow onto the meal... Certainly not work the money!  The eggs were raw (and sent back as previously stated), the sausage was disgusting, the mushrooms dried out quickly.  They got my friend's order wrong, but since they didn't enter it correctly on the receipt, they didn't offer to correct her order either.  When I sent back my eggs, the waitress said \""just so you know, this is a french-inspired restaurant and this is how they eat their eggs\"".  Good for the French, but we're in America, and I want my eggs cooked all the way through... and not even an apology.   \n\nAs far as the service goes, they were just slow.  The staff came across as unapologetic and stressed, which I don't know why because while I was sitting there, I only saw them bring out food for the couple that ordered before us.  The other 4 sets of people that were there before us either didn't order food (I'm assuming because no food ever came for them) or already had their food.  \n\nOverall, it was just a bad experience.  If I can say anything positive, the macarons were good.  My friend enjoyed her croissant, and the timing for our replacement eggs were much quicker.  \n\nIF and its a big IF I ever go here again, it will be strictly for the pastries."
2,It's a fun place to go with a big group of friends. With indoor and outdoor bar seating I really enjoy sitting back on the patio. The blood orange margarita is my most preferable drink. The food there is decent. The service is as well.
4,"Trattoria Cinecita is fabulous! When I say the word \""delicious\"" I am not referring exclusively to the food, but rather inclusively to the the way the Manager George Benchimol textured the entire meal with genuine warmth and expert service! As a foodie I would recommend this restaurant to all, but the dining experience was made truly extraordinary by the leadership. Bravo! A real find!"
1,"Was my 1st time at Carlos O'Brien's, it was a friends 40th birthday dinner and this is her favorite place to go. I went with high expectations because she has told me over and over the past few years how good this place is.\n\nI arrived couple minutes after everyone was there and saw that the party (there was about 25 of us) was broken sort of into you, half the party down one side and other wrapped around the middle and the birthday girl was kind of not at either tables, just in the middle of the 2, which made it difficult for conversations to flow, you could talk to your half of the table, but if you want to talk with those on the other side of the restaurant, get up and walk over their then, needless to say, I stayed where I was at and talked amongst my fellow friends on my side, kept giving the bday girl a shout out and drinks to let her know we are here to party! \n\nLet's start with the salsa, their where 2 types, a pico de gallo and a hotter blend, which reminded me more of a smoky chipotle sauce.  Well the pico looked great, but had absolutely no flavor, no pepper ,no onion, no tomato flavor, not even the cilantro, which is my favorite ingredient to cook with, had flavor, even if you added salt and pepper to it, it didn't help.  The hotter of the two did have a nice smoky chipotle taste to it, so that was the one I went with it.\n \nI went with the filet of Salmon with mango salsa with Spanish rice and black beans.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and even though the top of the fish appeared to have some sort of rub on it, it too was lacking in flavor, I tossed on the mango salsa to see if that would help and sadly it did not, no flavor at all. I topped it with the smoky chipotle to give some sort of flavor and appearance that I'm not eating mush. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, no issues there.  Had this dish had flavor to it, it would have been amazing, but nope it did not.\n\nNow like I said we were spilt into 2 along one sided booth table things from one end of the room to the other, and there was apx 25 if not more of us. But by the time my end of the table had gotten their food, the other half was already paying and leaving.  It was not because I was late; I got their in time for orders to be taken. This was poor planning on the server's behalf, half the party had ready left by the time we got our bills.  I was bummed because I was wanting to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and poof she was gone .  I wanted to like this place, but I'm afraid I am a onetime diner here."
2,"Great outdoor seating area for good weather months, and there's a lot of people watching to be had from these seats.  Service & food quality are the same as the other Yardhouse locations in the valley, but this location is a little less rowdy (which I consider a plus).\n\nBeer selection is great but not so great.  If you're a beer enthusiast, you've already tried at least 90% of the beers.  If you're not a beer enthusiast, you probably won't care that there's so many beers to choose from.  I think they missed the mark by having tons of widely available beers at one place rather than having a lot of hard to find beers that people will like to try for the first time.\n\nPrices are too high - $6 pints, $10 for Spinach dip, etc.\n\nKona coffee ice cream dessert and homemade brownie are nice desserts."
1,"I wanted to love Scarpetta, I really did. I was still mesmerized by the striking view I got to take in during the grand opening and determined to prove all of the reviews about the mediocre service wrong, but our waiter left me no choice but to report otherwise.\n\nI want to point out the highlights before I rip Scarpetta to shreds. I came in for Restaurant Week so got the pre-fixe menu and chose the yellowtail, short rib agnolotti, and coconut panna cotta. I thought the yellowtail had great flavor and was presented beautifully. My only complaint was that it seemed to be served a little on the warm side to me which is a concern when it comes to raw fish.\n\nThe coconut panna cotta/guava soup was not only delicious but beautiful too. The almost tart soup was a nice contrast to the creamy panna cotta-probably the best panna cotta I've ever had! Not too rich or too sweet, and again, perfectly balanced with the cold fruit soup. I usually don't go for dessert soups, but I'd probably come back just for that.\n\nThe view is killer-great front row seats to the Bellagio water show!\n\nNow for the bad.\n\nStrike one: Maybe this is just me being very nitpicky, but the presentation of the short rib agnolotti was just gross. The pasta was served in a wide, shallow bowl and the appearance of pasta in one thin layer with hardly any garnish (save the breadcrumbs which had a nice flavor) was just unappetizing. Also, the pasta was incredibly greasy. I've had pasta in brown butter sauce before that didn't look like that. The filling was good, very rich and flavorful, but the sauce was just off-putting. \n\nStrike two: for the duration of our dinner, a toddler continuously screamed at the top of his lungs, banged on the table, stood on the booth in which his family was sitting and annoyed the crap out of the surrounding diners. As a fine dining restaurant, it's your responsibility to make sure that the experience is just that, fine dining. Which means if you need to tell this family who cannot control their spoiled infant to beat it, in the interest of preserving the experience for surrounding diners, then do it. After an hour of embarrassing behavior and ugly stares from other tables, the dad who was elegantly dressed in board shorts, shower shoes and a baseball cap removed the child from the fine dining situation. I feel like the management should've handled this earlier, but God forbid they offend one person who is offending the entire restaurant. \n\nStrike three: our waiter was a dud. I get it, everyone has their off days, but I think this waiter's life was a series of off days. I'm hoping that his service standards weren't lowered because we were getting what was essentially a discounted menu, but I can't help that think this was the case. Discounted menu=less tip? Not always. But if your behavior warrants a tip to match the discounted bill then that's what you'll get. It took about 15 minutes for bread to come out and for the waiter to bring water. Then another 15 minutes for him to take our order for wine. And about another 20 minutes to take our food order. I shouldn't have to flag you down and tell you we're ready to order. That's not my job as a patron of the restaurant. I wasn't in any rush, but those lapses in time mean either this dude was just straight up inattentive or suffering the early stages of dementia. Everything about the dinner just dragged on unnecessarily. He was inattentive and seemed disinterested in our table-there were only two of us and we're definitely not high maintenance so I'm not sure what the issue was.\n\nOur waiter was in no way personable and just rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe we caught him on a bad night. Maybe he didn't feel like we deserved the attention that someone who was ordering off of the regular menu did. Regardless, in these economically unbalanced times, when so many people are opting to eat cheaper or stay home and cook, I feel like the restaurant industry should feel the pressure to give diners the experience they pay for. Even if we were getting your dishes for a reduced price-we are still dining in your restaurant and your standard of service should be equal across the board. You are a fine dining restaurant and I hold you to a higher standard than, say a Denny's. But if you perform like a Denny's waiter, I will tip you like a Denny's waiter. \n\n\nI'm not sure I would come back because I was truly annoyed with the service. Maybe I'd come back for the guava soup...and have it at the bar."
1,"--lost its traditional feel through the remodel. where has the personality gone?\n--bulky dark wooden chairs need cushions, the whole place needs more fabric. great potential with lots of light and high ceilings. More bright mexican ceramics please. stark wall of crosses and exposed wood and wrought iron takes me straight to Nathan Lane's Birdcage apartment. LOL.\n--remodel great for small (150ppl) wedding parties with dance floor in the center of the room.\n\n--rice dry and unflavorful, no savor. beans again with no flavor.\n--table salsa is canned tomato sauce with pepper seeds and BASIL and the touch of sugar you get from Ragu! It's salsa, not marinara, people!\n--guacamole has cottage cheese as a thickener! ew!\n--chili colorado is just thick, no flavor.\n--service is slow and unhelpful, but prices are high high.\n--$9 for the cheese crisp is worth it. great crispiness and good cheese blend."
1,"Hash House A Go Go in the Plaza is a family friendly diner with portions meant for sumo wrestlers and competitive eaters.  The food pile is truly a spectacle in a place where quantity seems more important than quality.\n\nWe tried the Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles, the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, and a House Salad.  \n\nThe Fried Chicken and Waffles was average.  The chicken was crispy enough, but wasn't juicy and didn't have a lot of seasoning.  The waffles didn't have a bacon-y flavor, we wished they had just given us some strips of bacon instead.\n\nThe Fried Chicken Benedict was like three separate dishes piled into one--literally stacked right on top of each other.  One dish would be fried chicken and mashed potatoes, another would be a biscuit with gravy, and the last would be an eggs and bacon scramble with spinach, tomato, and mozzarella.  With all that on one plate you can't really distinguish one flavor from another, but you can make every bite different.\n\nThe House Salad was the standard bag mix of iceberg lettuce, nothing special.\n\nIf you do want to try Hash House A Go Go split a plate with someone and come for a true diner experience."
1,"This place has pretty good food, but the service was horrible for big parties and people with kids.  I have previously been here before with just my husband and it was better.  Our experience this time with a party of eight including two kids sucked. They sat us at a booth that was too small for us.  The server took forever to take our orders and did not come back to our table until he brought the bill towards the end of our meal.  I had to ask different waiters for things that we needed such as napkins.  When we asked for a refill for the kids milk, he charged us $4 more and did not even fill up the kids cup, I was just so pissed off by that point I just wanted to leave.  I asked for a comment card and they wanted me to write on scrap paper, which is bull*#@.  They said that I can call a manager for me to talk to but he was taking forever and I did not want to wait, so I'll just let yelpers know that the service is horrible."
1,Awesome atmosphere. Bartender was laughing on his phone while we were patiently waiting for our order to be taken. Then he wanted me to yell my order across the loud bar to him while he continued to stay on his phone. Very inconsiderate. Worst tortilla soup I've ever had!
3,"Went to Lulu's for brunch this past Sunday. Great atmosphere, delicious food, super friendly service!\n\nStarted off with french fries and aioli- Probably the best fries Ive eaten in Charlotte. We had four or five dipping sauces from which to choose. They were eaten quickly and with fervor (that's for sure!) \n\nFor my entree I had the burger with jalepeno relish and a fried green tomato on a challah roll - Oh the Challah roll, I wish you were utilized more often. An awesome burger all around!\n\nEveryone I was with seemed to enjoy their dishes as well. \n\nI will be back shortly !"
0,"Disgusting! Ordered Guacamole & chips, though the guacamole was green that was the only resemblance, flavor was horrible. Pork for the taco was similar to the consistency of baby food but flavor was so bad my boyfriend actually gagged when he tasted it. Food was cold, not even room temperature. Will not go back! No stars are warranted for this place."
0,"It really takes a lot to agitate me and yet the girl(s) at Rebel Oil #66 on the corner of Decatur and Flamingo managed to do just that.  I went in for gas.  The card reader at the pump was not working so I went in to pay for my gas.  There are two girls standing behind the counter talking ane one doing some type of inventory in front of the counter.  They ignore me for nearly 3 minutes.  Now you may be saying,,, \""Come on, its only three minutes\"" but when you are the only one other than the three of them standing there it seems like an eternity.  No \""Hello\"", \""I will be right with you\"" Nothing.  They just kept talking to each other and refused to acknowledge me until I cleared my throat.  All I got was a look.  No greeting, no inquiry, no nothing she just gave me the \""What do you want?\"" look.  So I ask for my gas, she rings it in and I walk back to my car.  No salutation,,,, nothing,  Just the look of irratation that I had interupted her morning coffee conversation with her coworker.  I am sure it was important and had something to do with cold fusion, world peace, molecular chemistry or something like that.  (Insert sarcasm here).  I get to the pump and low and behold.... nothing.  The pump wont turn on.  I go back in.  Still no inquiry what so ever so I say. \""I am not getting anything on the pump\"".  She goes over to the register and a few seconds later spouts out  \""Ok, go ahead\"".  Wow, she actually does speak.  Back to the pump.  Same problem.  I go back in.  I ask if they can just change my pump number.  She says \""Did you hit the green button?\""  (No, dumbass, you did not tell me I had to hit the freaking green button.) Since fairness is always in order this time I did not say anything I just turned around and walked back to the pump.  I finally get my gas and as I pull out the first thing in my mind is I am going to rip this joint on Yelp!  \nYou would think that with the hundreds of gas stations around (a lot with cheaper gas), the people working in them would make at least a tiny effort to be polite and friendly.  I guess Rebel Oil #66 on Decatur and Flamingo does not think that is necessary.  \n\nJoin my quest and get your gas somewhere else please."
1,"Tough review to write, because it's hard to separate how happy I am in my marriage from how happy I was with the wedding. But, this review needs to be written.\n\nNichole was our wedding planner. It was a small wedding, just 20 guests total. That isn't an unusual size for the Forever Grand chapel. There are two chapel rooms, one for weddings about our size and one for weddings about twice that size. It would be easy to say that we didn't get the stellar customer service because of the size of our wedding (oh, they must have been focused on bigger events) which is why I bring up the size. If anything, this is in the sweet spot for Forever Grand. Events the size of ours should be where they excel.\n\nMost of the folks who get married here do not live in Las Vegas. It's a destination wedding, and we were no different. We were really taken by the Hollywood Glamour package, which was around $1200 and included vintage hair and makeup, some flowers, some photos, videography, the chapel, the officiant, and the services of a wedding planner. The price seemed very reasonable. And no running around trying to schedule and arrange all those different services? Was exactly the \""no muss, no fuss\"" we were looking for.\n\nWe booked four months in advance. From the very first contact with Forever Grand, I was nervous.\n\nThe first email reply from our wedding planner, with the contract for us to sign and deposit to make to hold the chapel? It was wrong. In fact, it listed that day's date as the date of our wedding, and listed that as the date to pay the remaining balance as well. Not a good start. First contact and the attention to detail is not there. Any bride (or groom who has a bride) can tell you, weddings are ALL about details. You go on a website like theknot.com and you find out you have a couple hundred decisions to make before your wedding. You need all of those to run smoothly.\n\nBut hey, maybe it's just a one time thing? So we get the corrected version of the contract. It looks ok. Send it back. Yay, we have a wedding started!\n\nNext couple emails are pretty slow replies. But hey, she is mostly working on weddings that are only a few weeks out, so no worries right?\n\nWe get the questionnaire via email that lets us make about 100 different decisions. So we spend a couple weeks getting those nailed down and send it back. Our wedding is really simple. Just a matron of honor and a best man. No other bridesmaids, no groomsmen, no flower girl, no ring bearer. No rehearsal. Should be as easy as pie.\n\nThe only real customization we had was that we wanted red and cream sand for our sand ceremony, we wanted a completely civil ceremony (not religious at all), some upgraded flowers at the front, and special music to play when we exited (which we provided on CD). Four things total that we were deciding. Everything else was pretty much, do whatever you normally do.\n\nSo we get our confirmation email, and it has someone else's name and email address on it. WTF? Seriously? Another call back to Nichole. Oops, sorry, we will send you the right one.\n\nOk, here we go. Check it over, looks good, looks, good. Hey wait a minute. Our contract said there was a $100 weekend premium. This says $200. Another call to Nichole. Oops, sorry. Send you the right one.\n\nAlright, I am now pretty nervous about whether anything is actually going to turn out ok. And mind you, I am the groom! I shouldn't be nervous about anything other than oversleeping the morning of the ceremony.\n\nSo we show up a couple days in advance to Vegas. We stop by the chapel. Everything is good. It's all going to be fine. Sigh of relief. We will be ok.\n\nOr not.\n\nDay of the ceremony. Everybody getting ready. Stand here. Walk there. When this happens, you do this. Ok, we are good to go. Stand. Wait. Stand. Wait. aaaaaaaand. Here Comes The Bride! Yay! We are getting married! Father of the bride makes his handoff. Female guests are crying. We turn to face the officiant.\n\nHe starts in on bible verses.\n\nWHAT. THE. FUCK.\n\nWhat part of \""we want a civil ceremony\"" was not understood?\n\nNow mind you, I have been to church plenty of times. And the bible verses used in weddings aren't exactly the worst sentiments ever. Heck, we all like to hear that we are going to be happy forever with the support of our families. And I am sure some of the people in the audience were happy to hear those verses. But we didn't ask for them.\n\nGo through the steps of the wedding. It is far too late to try to change anything anyway. Just take them as kind words. It's a beautiful day. Smile and enjoy.\n\nTime for the sand ceremony. And, the sand isn't red. It's tan. So instead of the red and cream, we have tan and white. Sigh.\n\nAs we leave, our music plays. And we are caught up in the joy of being married. It is a wonderful day with friends and family.\n\nIf you don't care about details, Forever Grand is 4 stars.\nIf you do, or your bride does? Expect maybe half of your requests to be honored and accurate. Two stars."

0,"Why is it, there are 20 something registers but only 3 open? Every time I go there in the evening, there's always a line and I mean line as in 10-15 people in 2 lines. \nAlso why the crap do I need to show my receipt when you just seen me walk from the register after paying for my items?"
4,"i can now update my review. The croissants are fine, butt they are pricey, and I am not sure I will often bother going there to buy croissants for my breakfast. \n\nThe highlights are the pastries - I tried 5/6 of them and they were all delicious. They know how to do their mousses (lemon, pistachio - the latter was amazing), and their \""frians\"" (the crispy bottom of some pastries - e.g. chocolate) are terrific. \n\nVery nice gift for a party"
1,"Needed to get a quick pedi and couldn't make it up to see my regular gal in N.Scotts.  So I found Pro Nails by Julie via yelp.  \n\nHad the regular pedicure with callous treatment, paraffin, and nail art added.  The gal that did my services was very friendly.  \n\nThe callous treatment, some of it was starting to burn the tip of my toe and I told her.  She immediately dunked my foot in water.  The paraffin treatment was too hot and I informed her that it was burning my feet.  The nail art, she did a good job initially.  Then got sloppy with the thin metallic nail polish (you know the stuff that they use to make squiggly lines, etc).  A huge glob came out at the end and ruined a good portion of the nail design on my one toe.  \n\nThey use these plastic inserts in the tubs, which one may think helps with sanitation.  But I think that technically (I'm about 95% sure) they're still supposed to use a disinfecting solution between clients.  Letting the solution circulate 10 minutes.  \n\nAfter all, just because there is a liner, doesn't mean that the water that your feet are sitting in isn't touching the jets that propel the water to make the circulating action and bubbles.  \n\nThat's what I get for cheating my on my regular nail gal....being out $40 for a pedicure.  \nI probably wont be back."
4,"Love it when a place is fast food and doesn't taste like it. \n\nCarambas is my go to when I need a quick Mexican food fix without killing my wallet. \n\nPollo Fundido is great, the salsas are awesome and put together from scratch. \n\nWhat's even cooler is that they have a little mini bar at this location.  The other locations don't have that from what I've seen.\n\nLove it that they are home grown too."
3,"4 stars, because I'm a little picky with my 5 stars for when places make me want to hustle rides and instigate with people to get back somewhere.\n\nThe pesto chicken was decent like others said (I prefer D'Lish's more), and the tuna melt makes me want to rethink my strategy on healthy food and add more gooey, melty cheese to things...\nbut what stood out to me as more \""craving worthy\"" was the avocado turkey. The croissant was buttery and flaky and had really nice flavors with the aioli and avocado. So good.\nI did try the California toast and wasn't the biggest fan of the sundried tomatoes on top... just something about them. But I like that any menu item with avocado usually has a generous helping of it.\n\nI really like the hummus too (and the pita bread pieces that come with it, though don't let them get cold or else they'll be hard as rocks)- it's plain hummus with the sauce of your choice drizzled at the bottom of the cup and on top. I tried the garlic and the prickly heat (though it's a lot more sweet than spicy) and both were tasty. The garlic wasn't \""my coworkers are going to hate me in our afternoon meeting\"" strong, so luckily they can just hate me for calling afternoon meetings. For $2.50 it was a nice side to my sandwich to make my meal of sandwich+hummus more filling.\nYou'll probably find that it's \""just enough\"" food - you won't get stuffed or squelch a ravenous appetite.\n\nI've tried a sample of their Java Mocha Blast and it was pretty good. There are similar drinks at Coffee Plantation and D'Lish, so much so that it gets hard to rank them but this one has a stronger coffee flavor and adds Nutella for their own unique twist to the peanut butter+banana+mocha.\n\nOh and it might be good to note that they serve the full menu the whole time they're open, so maybe next time I'll grab breakfast at lunchtime.\n\nOne downside is that they seem to run out of the hummus often by lunchtime :("
0,"The kids wanted to watch Disney's Million Dollar Arm and Suncoast was the closest to home playing it.  It had been a while since visiting Suncoast, and the stench of cigarette smoke when you walk into the casino reminded me why we prefer Red Rock. \n\nI walk up to the cashier and ask for 2 adults and 3 kids for the 2:10 showing of Million Dollar Arm.  We walk in and the ticket taker tells us we're in theater 8.\n\nY'all should know that the children in our group were 5, 9, and 10 years old.  \n\nWe stop by concessions and load up with hotdogs, popcorn, drinks, candy...  $60 worth of junk!!  We could barely carry everything but we found our way to theater 8.  Something was playing which we figured were trailers.  We found a seat and sat down.  \n\nTo our horror, the characters on screen were cussing and making sexual motions.  The boys start giggling.  Wth?!?  Disney wouldn't show inappropriate trailers...would they?!?  \n\nI look down at the tickets and the lady sold me tickets to the 1:30 showing of Million Ways to Die - Rated R.  \n\nHow can you even sell children tickets to a rated R movie?!?  \n\nI was annoyed and mentioned to the assistant manager what had happened.  I wasn't asking for anything free.  I just thought they should know that they might be selling rated R movie tickets to minors.  \n\nThe asst manager giggles when I tell her what happened.  Really??  Then she offers to exchange the tickets.   I asked why?  I told her we would just walk into the right movie.  The theater was empty at 2pm.  As I left, the assistant manager was laughing with a co-worker about what had just happened.  Unbelievable.  \n\nThe ticket mixup was a nuisance.  The response from management was ridiculous."
1,"For some reason, as some point in my life I thought Stereo was a decent club. I think that had something to do with being in first year at uni, the first year away from home so everything in Edinburgh is big and shiney and new. \n\nBecause Stereo is most definitely not a decent club. Its one of those clubs where if your not a Chav, then you have no business being here. Unless you like to make out with random strangers while heavily petting said stranger, you're probably not going to like this place. I have seen people thrown out of here for almost completing the deed on the dance floor. Yeh, its that kind of place. \n\nA really annoying part of Stereo is their bouncers. They are on some uber power trip and seem to think they are the secret service and your trying to enter the White House or something. They grill you on where you have been all night and who with and why. Its a little extreme. \n\nHowever the saving grace of Stereo (which is why it gets two stars, not one), is the little known white room on the top floor. Generally the Chavs are too drunk to make it all the way up here so its usually empty. And on a Friday night its 80's night! So if you gather a huge group of super fun friends you can head up to the white room and have your own little private party. Complete with 80's music!\n\nBut the rest of the time this place is awful."
4,"I am super glad my guy found this place for me.  It's comfy and yummy.  And, the staff is really thoughtful/friendly.  \nSee my 'tip' for this fun coffee shop.  ;-)"
1,"What has happened to this place? Used to be delicious, but something's changed! Rude host...pointed us to a table (of course the personal cell phone BS going on with a friend was far more important) for a noon lunch, in a nearly empty restaurant. Nor good signs and we should have walked out then. We started with a bland egg roll. Moved on to fair won ton soup. Entrees of cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken, both on brown rice we're disappointing. Left us both wishing that we had gone for Thai food down the street instead! Save yourself and opt for one of the other fabulous dining experiences in Shadyside!"
2,Excellent food as always
1,"I stopped by here today with my parents and sister for breakfast.  We were debating over a place to eat in the Strip District and I offered up DeLuca's as I have had decent experiences there before and there is always a line out the door waiting for seats.  We arrived at around 9:15 and walked right into the restaurant and were seated in the upstairs portion.  The inside of this place is nothing special and looks like many other diners.  They did have a t shirt from man v food (circa 2006) on the wall above us.\n\nFor my breakfast I decided to start off with a coffee which was poured within seconds of ordering and delivered to our table.  Then after a few minutes of deliberating over the huge menu I ended up going with the Huevos Rancheros for my breakfast.  After ordering our waitress disappeared and I am pretty sure that I never saw her again until we had to ask another waitress to get her for our check.  That meant that after about 10 minutes of waiting with an empty cup of coffee, I ended up helping myself to the pot that was sitting nearby.  I never did get a third cup which would have been nice.  Anyways, after a reasonable amount of time our food made it out to our table and my Huevos Rancheros looked pretty good.  The egg was sunny side up and whenever I cut through it, the yolk dripped nicely onto the tortilla, cheese, salsa and chorizo underneath it.  It tasted decently enough although I would have personally liked it quite a bit spicier.  After I was about half way through my my meal the avocado that was supposed to come on it materialized to our table.  It was maybe 1/4 of a total avocado cut into 4 very small slices which were quickly gone.  Whenever my family and I had finished our meals we proceeded to wait about 10 minutes for our waitress to come to our table.  Finally giving up on that we asked another waitress to ask our waitress for the bill.  She did and about 10 minutes later and after again asking our waitress for the bill, we were able to pay.  The sad thing is that we were trying to get out of there and there was a huge line of people outside waiting to get in.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would probably avoid coming here in the future.  While the food was decent tasting I found it to be overpriced and our service was just miserable."
2,"After updating my driver's license photo on a Friday morning (because that's how I spice up my vacation week), I wanted to eat somewhere outside of my general dining zone. By chance, I happened upon El Mesquite and was pleased with my breakfast. My server brought out chips and salsa; man, their salsa kicks ass! Great flavor and fantastic heat. That held me over while I was waiting on the chilaquiles. As others have stated, the beans are on the runny side. But mixing them with rice fixes that.\n\nThe staff here was super nice, too. And for the prices, I'll definately be back when i find myself on the south side."
2,"The BF and I went out to this place this morning/afternoon to get some coffee and try some of their famous -ish cupcakes. The coffee was good, strong, but not too strong and the latte was prepared fairly well. The cupcakes, however, were nothing super special. I got the pina colada and the BF got the something glam cupcake (?)...the cakes were very pretty with glitter and sprinkles, but as far as flavor goes...it wasn't that great.  Definitely no reason to drive out to BFE....now, if you live in BFE, at least you have a coffee shop that's not starbucks and is fairly good. So there's that. and the surroundings are pretty and a nice change from Phoenix."
0,"Went here for my honeymoon. The air conditioner was making a loud noise when we got to our room at 2:30pm. I called the front desk and asked if we could switch rooms and was told that they would have maintenance come look at the unit. The guy shows up to our room at 10:35pm. He looks at the unit and says that they needed to replace a motor. Said he would come back the next day at 11:00 (Saturday). He never showed up for the rest of our stay. When I checked out (three days later) the clerk at the front desk showed no remorse or apology. Not much good to say about the Luxor. I am sure they were good in their heyday but they really need to get their PR together. The carpet looks old, the elevator felt like it was going to come loose and fall down the shaft. I am DONE with the Luxor and say never again! Thumbs DOWN Luxor #0 on a scale from #1 to #10."
4,"this place is amazing!  everything is made to order and they have fantastic breakfast dishes and a great selection of bread, beer, wine and cheeses.  i was very impressed with the quality of their food, espresso and cleanliness of their store.  it is dog friendly and a great place to eat.  i hope to come back to this place whenever i am in town---they offer something for everyone and also have a very good gift shop with shirts, cards and books and other unique stuff.   for those seeking quality food at reasonable prices, this place is very hard to beat.  i only wish they had one of these in Seattle."
4,"Once upon a time there was a restaurant named Vig. It lived in Arcadia.  It wanted to be cool, but was only half cool because it was constantly infiltrated by the evil clan of douche bags named Scottsdalians.  Then one day Vig met a better neighborhood called Cenpho/Uptown.  They fell in love and made a new Vig in a beautiful mid-century mod Bank in Uptown.  This new Vig was about a zillion times cooler.  Proof that sequels can be better than the original.  (Please see Back to the Future 2, Empire Strikes Back, or Evil Dead 2 for more confirmation of this.) \n\nVig Uptown has an awesome Bocce Ball court in the restaurant.  The food is all good... Ask Juan Schwartz.   The drinks are all well poured.  The bar staff is excellent... They have Tito's handmade vodka in stock and its very well priced.  The crowd is way cooler and the valet's are always on point.  I am a regular at the Vig Uptown, you probably should be too. \n\nOh, and if you live in the neighborhood, the Vig Rig will pick you up and take you home.  He works on tips only, so leave the ride at home and tip the Vig Rig instead of the valet... SO worth it.  \n\n...And i lived happily ever after."
4,"Joey is a wedding photographer extraordinaire!  At my wedding he had something like 5 cameras hanging around his neck. He knows his stuff. I used Joey for my enagament photos around the strip (7/3/13) and for wedding (10/17/13). I decided I wanted a non traditional intimate wedding but wanted something special with family and close friends. When I decided on a Vegas wedding... I thought I probably wouldnt be able to get an amazing photographer.  I know in other area like the bay area (where Im from) and southern California (where I currently live) the average rate for wedding photographers is around $3000+ that would have been around 30% of my wedding budget! Having amazing photos of my wedding was one of the most important vendor decisions (above floral, makeup, even venue etc). I love photography and these photos are how I will forever remember my wedding. I was delighted to find Joeys website. He had an extensive portfolio and he even posted his AFFORDABLE rates on his website.  He answered all my emails promtly. My photos are gorgeous!  I get so many compliments on them. He almost made the ceremony look even more beautiful then it was... how does someone do that? My mother-in-law commented about the ceremony photos \""this is how Heaven must look like\""...which is funny because I thought the same thing. He really went above and beyond. During my engagment shoot, he met us on a holiday weekend on the strip at 9pm and worked with us until after midnight to get thousands of shots (he charged a low flat rate for this). It was 110\u00b0 at night and the streets were packed! At my wedding he worked tirelessly throughout the 8 hours we hired him for... he wouldnt he even take a break when I asked him to have something to eat. My guests even remarked on how hard he was working.  Thank you Joey for giving us amazing wedding photos that we will treasure for the rest of our life!"
0,"Extremely unprofessional. In the waiting room I heard the secretary have to reschedule several appointments because \""the system doesn't update properly and they're looking into it.\"" They can't copy Xrays so the entire reason we went there is useless. Had to get another xray at the oral surgeon, and they still billed us for the Xray that we couldn't use."
4,"My girlfriend and I have been to several yogurt shops in San Francisco (which there are plenty), and this is better than all of them.  They offer more flavors and more toppings at way cheaper prices.  You get nearly double or triple the amount for the same price as other places.  Plus, you get to pump the amount of yogurt and apply topping yourself, which not all other places offer.  \n\nThe only drawbacks this place has is that it is too popular so lines can be 5-10 minutes long.  Also, there is no indoor seating, and there are only 3 tables outside.  It's disappointing to beat the heat with frozen yogurt only to have it melt while you eat it in 100+ degree heat..."
4,The ice cream is so rich and creamy. They make the ice cream homemade at the stand so it is really fresh.
1,"Today was my second time going to Parkway House Family Restaurant and I did not enjoy it.\n\nA week ago a friend of mine introduced me to is and I ordered the porkchops, eggs, and toast breakfast. It was delicious! My friend's daughter got Chocolate Chip Pancakes, and my friend got a BLT Sandwich with egg. Everything came out quick, made to order, and delicious. Our waitress was real friendly and quick to get us refills and checked on us regularly. I knew I'd have to come back.\n\nToday I go with a different friend and order a bologna and egg sandwich (add cheese, tomato, and lettuce) while she got a bacon, sausage, and egg sandwich (add cheese). We both ordered hashbrowns with add ins (cheese, mushrooms, onions, ham). We waited a good 20 minutes for our food and then it came out cold and the hashborwns were burnt/rubbery chewy and disgusting. I added tomato and egg onto my sandwich but it was not on my sandwich when it arrived. I asked for it and it took another 10 minutes for the waitress to bring it out. Upon bringing it to me she says, \""I'm glad you didn't eat it all because I forgot about you!\"" in a happy, peppy sort of voice. By then, my food was more than cold and I was not happy. I decided against my meal and she kindly took it away and marked it off the ticket. She waited on the people behind us and told them \""You can't go wrong with breakfast!\"" and they got their meal within 5 minutes of placing their order! I found the waitress I had on the first visit and placed a bologna sandwich to go and told her the last one came out cold.\n\nThe menu is very fairly priced (which is what gave it one star) and some service is very good (another star).  They serve breakfast all day, which was why we decided to go there when we did. The second visit was very disappointing and I have decided that I will not try them again."
3,"Good price, good place! \nVery easy to find what you are looking for and they have something for every budget so its great.\nThe only down side would be the location.\nVery hard to find parking during the day."
2,I hate the pharmacy it's always slow at this one.
1,"On the plus side, there are a lot of lights on the Strip!   From a distance, it looks glamorous and fun.\n\nUp close, it's a different story.\n\nUp close, it just makes me sad.  I feel sad because if tourists come here from other countries and base their opinion of the US solely on what they see on the Strip, they would think we are a bunch of overweight alcoholics, who wear clothes that are much too tight and short, and that we want prostitutes to come to our hotel rooms in 10 minutes.  \n\nI know, I sound like a prude. But as I see another drunk young lady, teetering in ridiculous heels, valiantly chugging from a yard long plastic vessel full of some sugary sweet, booze-filled drink, I have to wonder if she is really having fun or if she just thinks she is.\n\nAnother thing that is particularly depressing to me is the women who are handing out cards for \""dates\"" that you can have in your hotel room in 10 minutes.  Do they understand what they are doing to these other women, who are someone's sister, daughter, mother?\n\nWalking down the Strip at night, I pray for humanity.   \n\nIn the morning, it's actually pretty nice though and a good place for a run."
3,"Just went tonight with coworkers as we're staying right in the area, apparently both of them had been here before and thought of it fairly highly. Food was good, I had the lamb shank which was pretty well done for a brewpub. Beer was also pretty tasty as well, especially the seasonal porter and the regular wit. Service was pretty friendly so I would come back."
1,"We were very disappointed with the seafood options, especially shellfish. \n\nVery dark inside. Take your money to the Ocean Club instead."
0,"I was in town for the weekend with my son (13) and his friend. asked the front desk at my hotel if there was any good Chicago style pizza places in Madison. I was directed to rosati's. such a disappointment. very bland & the crust...just no. the teenagers even thought it was mediocre. we each tried a slice, put the rest in the hall & called a different place."
4,Absolutely will not buy my dog food anywhere else but Choice Pet Market. We have two Great Danes that eat about 125lbs of food a month so needless to say we are in the store a lot. Never once have we had a bad experience with shopping here. Ashley is always more than willing to help people out and she works with us to price match for the best deal. The higher standard of product and knowledgable staff make it well worth the price. You get what you pay for.
2,"I can''t get over the process it took to get my food ordered.  It seems as if no one there actually listens.  The guy on the phone did more talking than listening and was just spitting stuff out.  He asked me for my address and I started with \""1031\"" and he'd interrupt along about the \""30\"" part and say \""1069\""? So I had to go \""1\"" pause for 5 seconds, 0, pause for 5 seconds because it was clear that he was a moron and didn't want to hear me to begin with.  THAN, the driver calls me and says he can't find me the address was wrong.  THEY PUT FLYERS ON MY DOOR!!  The food was \""okay\"" but I think from now on I will go with Chopsticks Express, better food and not all the hassle."
0,"I just visited this restaurant because I was attending a convention at the Las Vegas Convention center which is connected to the Hilton. \nWe felt like steak so we decided to have TJ Steakhouse which is right next to Casa Nicola, but they were booked and we had to wait for an hour. We were starving, so for convenience my coworker and I decided to have dinner at Casa Nicola.  What a HUGE mistake. \nI looked at the menu and the price was high for a Italian restaurant but figured the food must be that good.  Boy was I wrong. \nMy coworker ordered a Seafood Linguine (forgot the exact name) and I ordered the Ossobuco (veal) with creamy Risotto rice which is supposed to be one of their signature dishes. (according to their website) We also ordered some napa valley Merlot to compliment my dish. The wine was pretty good, but that was about it. Actually my Ossobuco was horrid. The meat was very tough (this is veal mind you), dry: almost like they had the meat precooked, left out and then warmed it in a steamer or something, and the sauce just reeked of butter. The risotto just sucked and tasted like I was scooping up butter into my mouth. I have not had Italian like this even at Olive garden. At least the food there compliments the price, my dish alone was $37.99. Ridiculous~!!! for the quality of food that they serve here. My Coworker is pretty much a food connesoir and thought the food was horrible. (obviously his pasta sucked too) \n\nI do not mind paying good money for good quality food but this place is not that. The food is not just average...it is horrible. \nI have enjoyed food far superior at places like Maggiano's which is a lower grade restaurant in terms of price than Casa Nicola. \nDO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY HERE!!!  It will surprise you how bad it is."
3,"Amazing food and worth the wait! We had the fun of playing \""the game\"" with our waiter. He asked questions about our preferences and then custom ordered burgers for us. We had the jalape\u00f1o poppers for an app... Seriously yummy. My burger had 4 cheeses, mushrooms and avocado... The bun is even amazing. Often long lines to be seated... Come prepared with a cocktail.. :-)"
4,Looks can be deceiving.  Awesome food.
2,"Surprisingly, it was one of very few things open when I went out looking for food. The service was good. Food was OK."
0,"Over the past few years this place has been my theater of choice. The seats are nice, there aren't many crowds, parking is easy, etc. The biggest complaint I've had (up until today) was the locations of the men's restroom. There's only one beyond the ticket gate, and it's at one end of the building, not central at all. \n\nTonight, they let me down. Came here for the midnight showing of The Hunger Games. I've been to nearly a dozen, but this was my first with this theater. My party (in its entirety) arrived at 730pm. At the time, there were 159 people ahead of us. Everything seemed like a normal midnight showing until about 8:30 when they rolled out their wristband cart. At first I thought this was going to be great, and help eliminate the line cutting that occurs. (and perhaps speed things up like they claimed) Instead, they came around multiple times and gave wristbands to the people who came late, but cut everyone in line. Slightly annoyed, I plowed on knowing that a large bulk of the crowd comes after they start letting us into the theater. Around 10 the crowd was getting pretty anxious, but there was no sign of them letting us inside. 10:15 came and everyone stood up and prepared to go in. 10:30 and everyone is still standing, but not moving anywhere. It wasn't until 11:00 and a third round of putting wristbands on the line-jumpers that they opened the doors. I would estimate 350 people ahead of me by this point. They let people inside in groups of 25 or so, so that took some time. At 11:20 I finally got inside and to my theater. To my great frustration, there were more people in my theater (1 of 4) than there were in line when I arrived. \n\nTo the management: please improve your midnight showing strategy. Have tighter line queues, stop the cutting by using your wristbands, but only come through each section once. Perhaps give people a warning that they need to be in line in 15 minutes to get a wristband, and if they miss it, they will have to go to the back of the line. Also, let people in around 10pm like Harkins and AMC do. You'll have less cutting to worry about, and you'll even make more money on concessions. \n\nAssuming I don't receive a response from the management explaining how they are going to improve, I will take my theater business elsewhere for the midnight showings."
0,Filthy line. You would think they would be more concerned with the appearance of the kitchen(line) sense it is visible. Its makes you question the sanitation. I won't be coming back.
0,"Went to the chocolate factory had delicious samples and decided to buy some chocolate, while I was looking to see which ones I wanted their was an elder lady I believe her name is Judy. She rudely asked if we where ready so we told her we where still looking she rolled her eyes and sighted loudly throwing her gloves in the trash annoyed. When she came the second time around to see if we where ready we told her we had a question and left us talking to ourself and went to the cash register to fold boxes. Then a young African American lady came and helped us very nice lady. I was shocked at how rude she was I wanted to talk to a supervisor but my husband just wanted to leave and didn't let me."
0,Check in staff was great the view from out side was ok. Then the room electrical switches that are barely sticking out some you can see wires on. Paint was peeling all over and the shower was falling apart the caulking was all coming off. These rooms are not what I expect for this price. Even the tv which was a older flat screen did not have HD and half the channels failed to work. Breakfast was not great and  they failed to clean up tables so no where to sit and eat. Pool area had several areas trapped off as well as the parking lot had a lot of it closed. Over all very disappointed in this property I would not recommend it. When I checked out I was told your good to go as she ate her breakfast and then walked away not once was I asked how my stay was.
4,Mori helped save me $$ by fabricating a new clip for my back power window. If I bought a new part it would have cost a couple Benjamin's. He rewired the old piece. I also asked him questions about what would be the best suv to buy next. Usually car guys don't like to answer questions but he was very helpful.  They even washed my car for me!! Will be back for more car service & advice. Thank you so much!

1,"I'm not sure what to think about this place. The first time I ordered, I got a french dip and it was pretty good. But today I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was pretty bad. It tasted a bit soil-y, like the lettuce was unwashed. The bread was dry and stale and the whole sandwich crumbled apart. My coworkers got wraps and seemed to like them, but I probably won't order from here again."
3,"Four of us went at 7:00pm on a Wednesday night and it was busy with a wait list. We forgot to call ahead and so we went to the bar area to wait (which was also full). There is an outside patio area off of the bar, but we chose to stay inside. We did not have to wait very long (20 minutes). The staff was friendly and efficient. Our appetizers were delicious and I ordered the lemon-grass shrimp as my entree (one of my Favs). The manager came back and apologized that they were out of that dish, so I ordered the Ginger Salmon. He then sent us some complimentary shrimp dishes! I was so full that I took home the salmon for dinner the next evening (it was delicious)! I really appreciated the extra effort they made."
2,"This show is pretty incredible and yes, gravity defying, but if you have seen the traveling Cirque shows it may leave you wanting more. The production value and moving stage is something to be seen, and if you can, do. I just thought the show was more choreography than acrobatics. The shifting, ever evolving stage on hydraulic shafts? AMAZING. whoever thought of that should get a medal."
3,"Consider me a big fan!  \n\nI was perusing potential spots for dinner last night and then I saw My T's picture of the 5 spice game hen and it..waS...ON.  They bake the game hen and THEN deep fry it!  Why don't more spots bake and then fry things?  It tasted even better than it looked.  The side of tomato rice was really good too.  I almost never rave about eating bird but I will be having this again.   \n\nAnother favorite was their shaken beef salad.  I was shaken up after my first freakin bite!  The beef was so juicy and so tender and only $12!  The hot grilled beef mixed with the cool lettuce, onion, tomato and spices made for one of the best salads I've had in recent memory. \n\nThe Mekong River noodle soup was just ok.  It looked great and was filled with lots of fixings like fish balls, pork tenderloin, quail eggs, veggies and shrimp but the pork based broth fell short for me.  I saw a lot of customers going for the bone marrow soup and holy shit what a spectacle that was.  HUGE bones!  Me would feel like caveman and raise bone like champion (grunt!).  Check out the pics of it.  \n\nBut man oh man so much other stuff I want to try like the slow braised pork belly entree, crispy bird nest noodle and more shaken beef!  They're located in the old Cravin Cajun spot so it's great for groups.  I hope they get their liquor license soon."
4,"I had received a flat tire yesterday and went to Costcos tire center at first because I had been there before. He told me they didn't have my tire in stock but to go to a discount tire and printed me a quote so they could match that price. They had said $175 for one tire. I knew that 3 of my tires would need replacing as well considering they are old. When I arrived here he agreed that I would need 3 and asked me if I had a price range I wanted to stick in, me being in sales appreciated that because it didn't make me feel pressured or being up sold. I gave him the quote from Costco and immediately said I will give you a better deal then that. Needless to say I only paid $219 for 3 tires! Awesome service and it took less than 30 minutes. I now know where I will be coming in the future for my tires!"
3,Since Jamms is right across the street from where I live it is my go to weekend breakfast treat. I can always get a seat at the counter no matter how long of a wait it is for a table.  Jamms has illi coffee from Italy and you have the option of the little creamers in the plastic cups or milk served in a mini glass container. The also have a different flavor of their pot of bread weekly. I usually get something off of the breakfast menu but they have great soups and sandwiches too!
1,"Fresh 52 is ok, barely. The corn man had the best deal at 5 buds for $3. But I'm not a big corn fan. I wanted some strawberries or apricots. Maybe some spinach or green beans. Some kale perhaps. Maybe some apples. But I'm not paying $5 for a pound of strawberries when I can get 2 for $5 at Sprouts. $4 for a pound of green beans. Yea... I'm getting in my car right now & going to my nearest Sprouts."
0,I didn't like this place at all. I came with 3 friends and non of us like there omelets. There were very dry tasting...
2,"I've eaten at this HAG location twice.  Each time, the wait staff were attentive and responsive.  It's a limited menu - but portions are substantial.  The fries are above average and I rate the shakes as O.K.  It detracts from the shakes that they are served in cheap plastic cups.  I thought the burger was good - with a fresh bun, good meat and garnishes.  Even the minimal single burger is big, my wife could only eat half of her burger.  The shtick involved with the whole faux medical thing is cheesy but tolerable.  It was kind of fun watching others get spanked and teased by HAG staff."
2,"We went here after the awesome Yelp Spring Fling, and had a sampling of a number of menu items. The \""ambience\"", if one can use that term here, was part taco joint, part Mexican food store, and part Mexico City bus station replete with a tv showing telenovelas. We were dying for tequila or at least a nice cerveza, but alas, no liquor licence. However, they do have some \""drink if you dare\"" Mexican sodas, which contain twice the legal limit of sugar and food coloring of normal soda (which I generally don't drink anyway, unless it's mixed with something). Don't expect too much in any regard here. They do tacos, fairly well, and that's what I'd recommend ordering here, although something possessed me to order the tamales too (more on that in a sec). We started off with guacamole. Having lived a good 10 years in Texas, and traveled a lot to Mexico for work, it was, well, really odd. They mix iceberg lettuce and tomato in with the avocado, and there's nary a hint of garlic or lime. The result is a bit gloopy and fairly unpleasant, especially if you're expecting a beautifully dense unctuous avocado forward, garlic, lime, salt, and cilantro based dip. Oh well. The tortilla chips though, which seemed homemade, were light and crisp, and we even bought a bag to take home. The salsas were equally good, with the tomato based one being the standout. The tomato salsa was served warm, and had bay leaf and celery in it - a flavor combo I've never had in Mexico, but one which really worked. We also bought some salsa to take home. We had beef tacos and tacos al pastor. The beef tacos were pretty good, but too much char on the meat, and the overall flavor was bland. The tacos al pastor were just as they should have been though, nicely cooked meat and great tang from the pineapple. Big marks also for serving everything with soft corn tortillas. The tamales though were pretty bad. I am a big tamale fan. These were mealy and dry, and the filling was cloyingly sweet and unpleasant. This place does tacos, and they do them pretty well. I'd come back for the tacos al pastor and chips and salsa, and the telenovelas of course. Hasta pronto."
0,"I rarely write negative reviews but I just had to for this company. What terrible service! They failed to show up on the first scheduled appointment & when I called they mysteriously \""lost\"" my information. When they did eventually clean our house I was not impressed at all. I'm not usually that particular when people clean my house but they did a terrible job. Mirrors & counters weren't cleaned well & they only cleaned one side of our sliding glass door. I could go on but will spare you. You get the idea. Save your time & money, don't use Pretty In Pink Cleaning. Is it too much to ask for a reliable & professional cleaning company!?"
1,"We read so many good reviews on Yelp that we had to try this place. We took the light rail and arrived around 830pm Saturday night. \n\nThe place looked very promising with its modern indoor/outdoor blended setup. It was a full house but not too packed. We waited around 20 minutes for a table which was passed with a round of drinks from the bar. This is where the downhill slide began. A Plum Blossom was ordered from the cocktail menu. It was so sugary, it really was totally undrinkable. The two Kiltlifters ordered came with about an inch and a half to spare to the top, as if someone took some sips on the way from the bar. The glass of house white was barely acceptable. \n\nDuring our wait we had time to study the menu and decided the pumpkin soup and pepper crusted flat iron steaks would be ordered by at least two in our party. Little did we know until seated that they were out of the flat iron steak which left very limited options. \n\nWith pumpkin soup on the way along with a burger, the roasted chicken, and a flatbread, we still had high hopes. \n\nThe pumpkin soup was brought quickly. The plate was burning hot and the soup ice cold with a hardened film covering the top. We would have sent it back but our entrees arrived so soon after there  wasn't time. Apparently they pre-pour and use heat lamps. \n\nThe flat bread was just so so...very dry. The chicken was nothing to write home about. The burger was super well done (ordered medium well) and very dry. The menu states that it comes with a choice of sides but when we asked our waitress she stated that it only comes with fries. \n\nA bottle of Patz&Hall Pinot Noir was ordered for the table. Normally we love Pinot's but this one was awful. It was much too harsh. \n\nBy the end of the meal we had had enough. Dessert was offered but we politely passed. \n\nMaybe we are the sole recipients of a bad meal as the star ratings on here are very high. But in our opinion, Postino's and Maizes have nothing to worry about if this is the best St. Francis can offer. \n\nOn the plus side, there was a very entertaining crowd. The women's  bathroom was occupied by a frolicking couple so all in our party had the opportunity to digest the provocative corral art in the men's room. \n\nNormally this place would deserve nothing better than a single star but it gets two as the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was worth something."
0,"To hell with this airport and really, to hell with Arizona.\n\nThat hurts me to say, I met my wife while we both lived and worked at Grand Canyon, and I've spent a lot of time in mostly northern Arizona.  At one time I dreamed of retiring to a small ranch with lots of big dogs and Mount Humphreys looming in the distance.  No more, those days are long behind me.\n\nThe combination of my disgust with Phoenix - really just a hotter, dryer version of LA -  and the unseemly politics of people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Governor Brewer have  pretty much taken me to the point where I don't plan to set foot (or spend another dollar) in that state.\n\nThis airport blows.  It's huge, if you rented a car it succeeds in outdistancing even Providence in terms of how far you must travel to get your vehicle.  Plan on an extra half hour to take shuttle buses and then hunt for your car due to the extreme lack of effective signage and staff.\n\nAnd please tell me why the hell I'm paying for your football stadium.  Your team sucks, you have a (ridiculous) corporate sponsor for it,  so why are people who could not care less about the Arizona Cardinals paying a stadium surcharge?\n\nI'll continue to vote with my dollars, and none of them will be heading to Arizona.  As someone who flies a lot, all over the world, Sky Harbor is on my personal shit(hole) list."
4,"Burger GODS~  Flew in from Minnesota to have a burger, worth the flight!  Can't wait to come back!"
0,"If you Re there for beer, microbrews and such, this is the place for you.  However, if you are looking for a good chili dog, try someplace else.  While the hot dogs are of good quality, they honestly have the blandest, odd tasting chili I have ever had.  First off, I don't like beans in hot dog chili.  Second, it didn't really add any flavor.  It just gave it an odd texture.  They are also overpriced.  Their onion rings weren't all that good either.  Lots of microbrews makes one hope for beer battered onion rings.  Nope!  Just crappy almost store bought low quality breaded onion rings.  And change your fry oil once in a while!  So to sum up, beer: good.  Food: sucks."
2,"Curving around the corner of Cockburn St is the Malt Shovel. This is one of few pubs nearby with a local clientele and an attractive spot waiting for a train, given its handy location near Waverley Station.\n\nThe Malt Shovel has an attractive green painted exterior. Inside it has a traditional atmosphere, although the pub itself is more modern. There are a number of levels in this pub, not floors, different rooms with slightly different decor. \n\nThis pub offers food from lunch time to evening, with standard pub meals on offer. The pub is well known for its extensive selection of single malt whiskies. It also offers live music throughout the week, which might not always be as appealing as some of the other well known folksy bars in Edinburgh, but still makes for a more interesting evening."
4,"I never run back to work after lunch to Yelp about my great lunch experience. At least, I never have until now. I wasn't supposed to eat out today. I just wanted to get out of the office for a bit and finished reading Memoria de mis putas tristes. Somehow, I ended up in front of this place and the rest, as they say, is history... well, not really history, but you know...\n\nMany, many moons ago this pace was called Dynasty Buffet and it was a Chinese buffet. For what it was, if I remember correctly, it was pretty decent. It was kinds upscaley for a Chinese buffet.\n\nWhen I pulled in the front of the restaurant did not look particularly inviting. It's a big box building with big red letters and kanjis very similar to the way you see in Asian markets. Just kinda loud and... well, a bit tacky.\n\nI said, \""F it\"" and went in since it wasn't a buffet and I would get to read some while I waited for my food. The place is very spacious and minimally decorated. What little is there fits nicely with the atmosphere. The host and the waitresses were very pleasant and helpful.\n\nYou are given a menu, a pencil and a sheet of paper with a laundry list of dumpling options. I ended up settling for the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special (with your choice of egg drop. wonton or spicy egg drop soup) and sticky rice. To boot, I added a side order of chicken feet (HELL YEAH!) and some shark fin dumplings. The older Chinese waitress had to double check I knew I was ordering chicken feet before she wrote it down! haha.\n\nAfter I placed my order I grabbed by book and continued reading. Before I finished the page here comes a piping hot bowl of delicious egg drop soup. The soup was very good, better than average, and it came with a little pile of those flaky crackers and some chili paste. My Kung Pao chicken was delicious and very, very spicy! Unlike your average Chinese food strip mall hellhole, Dynasty understands its food and separates the rice from your main dish.\n\nShortly after came my chicken feet in a nice dark sauce topped with slices of jalape\u00f1os. They were delicious but very hard to eat and messy! They were perfectly cook and the bones were tender enough to chew threw if you chose to, like Becky, I chose to juts suck the marrow and the skin off.\n\nThe shark fin dumplings, which I've never had before, were delicious. Hot and had a very nice crab meets lobster and fish taste to them (can't really describe it) and were very nicely sized. Needless to say, I didn't finish it all.\n\nInterestingly, both the host and the waitress were genuinely interested in hearing my opinion of the chicken feet and the dumplings. They came around and chatted with me about the food and my thoughts which was awesome.\n\nIn front of me sat an older Chinese couple. At one point the woman got up and walked by my table, I noticed she did a double-take on my table but kept on going.  On her way back she stopped by the table and told me that I knew how to eat Chinese food like Chinese people do! hahahaha. We had a nice chat about how they really like this place because it's one of the few places where they can get real Chinese food they way they eat it back home.\n\nI will definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone who is an adventurous eater or likes really good Chinese food."
4,"Love this gym. Always clean, never super crowded, awesome staff. Never had any problems here. If you want to talk to an awesome manager, ask for Kevin. Awesome dude."
3,I come here for my aquarium needs and their prices on a lot of their stuff is cheaper than petsmart. I have a lot of betta tanks and  I love their selection on live plants. But a lot of the plants look like they are dying. It also hard to find someone to help out in the fish area. No one is ever around. \n\nI love how they have Elephant Ear Bettas. I've never seen them anywhere else. I hate that they don't have prices near them. And they charge $20+ for EEs. When I was just recently in there a few days ago a lot of their bettas looked pretty bad. \n\nThe staff is very friendly. I've never had a problem with anyone there. The cashiers are always very nice and they like to strike up conversations with you while you check out. \n\nI think this store is WAY better then the petsmart across the street. I've never seen any dead or dying bettas. Their bettas only have some fun problems that can easily be fixed. \n\nThey also have some awesome bamboo shrimp! I had bought one and sadly he didn't live. I guess they are ok with selling old ones to people. The one I had gotten was fully grown and died of old age. When I was in there the other day I saw that they had smaller ones that are obviously young and that's when I figured out they had sold me an older one. I will get more of them but this time I'll make sure they are young.
0,FYI. Chili's still sucks.
3,"get the ngocchi and that is all I have to say.... do it before you die.   The stuff melts in your mouth and I have never had it taste so good anywhere else.  The food and service are great at this place and the prices are like a really high end restaurant.  This place has been around since the 70's and it shows...which is my only complaint.  I really wish they would remodel this place and revive it a little bit because the food is really good.  The owner is always around our server has worked there for 33 years if that doesn't tell you something.  The atmosphere in the bar is black and white checkerboard tile with mirrors for walls.  The dining room has been painted but the furniture is a little dated.  I ordered the veal Marsala and it was fantastic, my wife got the salmon and it was even better.  I wish this place was closer to home I would come more often."
1,"Vegas Yelpers!\n\nI'm always on a hunt for red velvet pancakes!\n\nCame here the other day with my boys Supercr3w/Jabbawockeez for Rainen's birthday breakfast. They are good friends with the owner Baja. Baja is super friendly and took really good care of us.\n\nThis is a hard review because the owner was amazing nice... but the red velvet pancakes... didn't pass my approval!\n\nI ordered the red velvet pancakes... with egg whites, chicken sausage and potatoes. I didn't care for their version of red velvet pancakes! I was bummed out and only ate a quarter of it. Something was missing in their recipe... I had better. My friends cousin also didn't like her order of red velvet pancakes... and only took a bite of it. The rest of my breakfast was doable... hard to mess up right?!\n\nI won't be back unless it's with the boys... if so I'll have to try the chocolate pancakes and update my review.\n\nCan't complain... I only paid... tip... Baja took care of us.\n\nAs for the red velvet pancakes... Sorry. Fail.\n\nCasual indoor dining. Check it out and lmk what you think."
0,"Super rude & nasty workers. Went there to return something/exchange. The 1st lady was by the register writing something. She just said wait. While she was writing not even saying please or greeting me etc. 2nd lady came to the 1st lady and said how that item is so old they don't carry it anymore. ?? Like what the hell is going on here I'm right in front of you and I can hear your stupid ass. After a few mins 1st lady was like what is this. I want to return or get a store credit because I'm not happy with this purchase. She's like we don't carry this item no more in the store. The hell you don't it's right there in the window display area in purple. She's like oh no it's different color and model. Well I want exchange it. She's like it pass 90 days you can't read the receipt. I jump back and was like WHAT.. It clearly says 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed don't u know how to read. I'm a paying customer how the hell your going to be so rude and trying to belittle your customer. She didn't want to help me at all. So I didn't get to exchange my item that I purchased in this store.\n\nI will never be purchasing from Kipling again. I have been buying Kipling items for many years. I'll be taking my money and business else where, where they respect their customers and value them."
1,"Fried chicken was good, but everything else was a joke.  The service was unbelievably bad.  The waffles were skinny and underdone.  First cup of grits had a tiny amount of butter and were way overdone, like they were scrapped out of the bottom of the pan.  When a second waitress saw what was in my bowl, and saw my dry ass overdone eggs (this was 5 minutes after they were brought out....I was still waiting for the chicken and waffles) she offered to bring new eggs and grits.  Second round, (still no chicken and waffles) eggs were much better but grits were underdone and watery.  When the chicken and waffles showed up, the waffles were already cool with no browning at all.  Coffee was terrible.  Wife's plate was just as bad.  Our original waitress never bothered to check on us until she brought the bill.  And to top it all off, the food is way overpriced, and over hyped!!!\nThe one solid was the chicken.  It was lightly battered and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The scrambled eggs were real, not the fake crap.  I just wish someone in the back new how to cook them properly.  With the exception of the one waitress who replaced my first plate, it seemed like no one there, including the cooks, really gave a shit about the food or the service.  Very disappointing considering all the good reviews."
2,"I wouldn't say it's the best chinese around but they are fast, efficient and clean.  They offer a decent lunch specials menu for under $10 and because parking is easy, you can easily get in and out during lunchtime in under 40 minutes (if you want).  The dishes that I have had are cashew shrimp, moo shu vegetables, vegetable lo mein and hot and sour soup.  I was satisfied with all of my choices.  They do offer brown rice make sure you specify that you do not want fried rice."
2,"I stayed at Palazzo on 1-4-13 to 1-8-13.  \n\nThe hotel was clean and pretty.  Checkins was fast and efficient where the staff was nice and friendly.  \nThe room was spacious but it need a little more work catching up to the Wynn & Encore.  It is not as clean as Wynn nor was the the staff was as friendly. Trust me, i would rather stayed at the Wynn any day  The decor and ambiance at Wynn is a lot better."
2,"I really wish I was writing a \""Hooray!\"" but I'm not. The Uptown location wasn't my first rodeo with the Mushroom and won't be my last.  The Mushroom is usually solid artisan pizza, just not this time.  I started visiting different Mellow Mushrooms about ten years ago.  The Jerk pizza has always been my \""go-to.\""\n\nI went to the Uptown location for a business lunch.  Not too bad.  We got seated in less than a minute.  The menu didn't have my favorite, but I'm the type of person that is willing to try many different things.  So I asked our waitress for a recommendation and was led to the Mellowterranean.  A grilled chicken pizza with onions, roasted red peppers, black olives, chives, feta, mozzarella and tzatziki sauce.  Sounds like a homerun eh?\n\nTwo things to note about this pizza:\n\nGigantic roasted red pepper laid out on the pizza.  This isn't convenient to eat, and the texture and amount just make this strange and unappealing.\n\nSecond, yes, the tzatziki is pretty tasty, but I found myself using it to cover up the other tastes.  A condiment should compliment, not be needed to cover up the  the rest of the dish.\n\nLastly, the cheese bread appetizer.  Oh how I laughed.  The look on my associate's face was priceless.  To quote, \""Is this cheese on hot-dog buns?\""  Lol...I almost spit water out my nose when he said that.  To be fair, what we were brought, looked nothing...and I do mean...nothing...like the picture you see on Yelp.  Maybe they were out of bread and went with the old \""McGuyver that shit\"" method...but \""hot-dog buns\"" is being nice about it.\n\nSo why three stars if the whole experience was less than decent?  Because I know the Mellow Mushroom as a whole.  I know that this is the only experience I've had that was disappointing.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe it was blah blah blah.  Regardless of what it was, I'd go back and expect things to be a much better experience.  Would I recommend or order what I've had?  Not a chance, but I wouldn't exclude them from my list of pizza joints based on one bad experience either."
0,"We decided to come here after a night of mini golf and it was a huge mistake. We got a table pretty fast considering how busy it was, but walking to our table we saw so many empty seats and so many people waiting. It was strange. I ordered a starter and its never a good sign when it come after your food gets there. Our waitress would forget things we asked for all the time and then when we would ask about it she would tell us she didnt forget she was getting to it. I would have given more respect if she would have just admited to forgeting and moved on. You dont have to lie. Everyone at the table wasnt happy with how there meal came out. Fish was over cooked, noodles dry, drinks being empty for long periods of time, when salad was brought out there was barley any in the bowl. Just a waste of time and money. Avoid."
4,"We loved dinner so much here, we came back for the very next meal: breakfast!  Although I liked the dinner far better than the breakfast (predictable, given my vegetarianism and dislike of eggs), I still want to give this five stars.\n\nIt's possible that I was dazzled because I really never eat at restaurants of this quality.  But if you also rarely dine like this, listen in:\n\n-Our server was adorable and fun, while still being respectful and unobtrusive.  Think about it --is there better criteria for a waiter out there?  He was like the perfect background music, and I'd go back for him alone.  I wish I remember his name --a young 30-something Polish guy.  But luckily there are many other reasons to return....\n\n-The cheese course was perfect in its range and selections.  Great accompaniments not only served alongside (honeycomb, the right breads and crackers), but also to the bread and pistachios at the table.\n\n-A wine list that gave just the right info to make good pairing choices.\n\n-I loved my gnocchi, served with winter vegetables in a mild and yet cohesive brown butter sauce.  It was heavy and greasy, and somehow that was a good thing.  A must-try!\n\n-Sides of pommes frites and mac and cheese set the bar for any future fry or mac 'n cheese, who will lose any battles they attempt.\n\n-Salad perfectly herbed and vinegared, worked great with the warm goat cheese.\n\n-The madiera tasting for dessert!!!  I had good madiera in storage before this.  Now nothing compares.  This may be a bad thing in general.  But that night, it was a very, very good thing.  1989 Madiera!!\n\n-I'm not a big breakfast fan, and I don't like meat or eggs.  (Anyone still reading!  haha)  But I can say that the french toast was excellent despite the egginess.  (It's more like a bread pudding, with apples.)  And the cheese danish was the best I've ever had.\n\nI'll not only be back to Bouchon next time I'm in Vegas, but Bouchon in Napa is now on the list for our honeymoon next summer!\n\nAbsolutely worth every single penny (yes, ALL of them).  Go."
1,Way over priced. Bartender is cute in the face but clearly miserable. Beer tap selection is far & wide though!
4,"One of the very best restaurants in Vegas. A true hidden gem!\n\nWhy go to Le Circ or Bouchon and pay overinflated prices for a fine French meal, when you can go to Pamplemousse for half the price and have a true French experience?\n\nIt doesn't look like much from the street, but walk inside and you will be instantly transported to Paris.\n\nThe food is unrivaled IMHO. I highly recommend the Fettucine ala George, a marvelously tasty appetizer as is the lobster bisque. They handle fish selections wonderfully and the tournedos are incredible!\n\nAnytime we are in Vegas we always dine here, don't miss it, it's wonderful, and easily half the price of any other French restaurant in Vegas you might consider."
3,This is my second time here. I like the way they team up on my car if they have extra hands available and get it done fast. And they do a good job. I just got my car painted so I don't want the high pressure hoses used on it. They gladly accommodate by using the regular hose. They offered to bundle and save me money when I asked for a detail on the inside.
2,"So...I'm not a huge fan of traditional Irish food, but stopped in to try something different last week. The place has a nice look to it...it reminds me of Rula Bula in Tempe. I went Friday afternoon and the place was dead. Literally 2 people at the bar and 4 people (other than us) eating. I tried the Guinness beef barley soup...has some nice flavor to it and some spice, too. Also had the Irish Wolfhound burger...while the burger was cooked a little more than I liked (ordered medium), it was juicy and hot, but lacked seasoning. There also wasn't very much aioli, I guess I should have asked for extra. Service was decent, but could have been better considering the place wasn't busy at all. I'm thinking this would be a good place to come after work for a few drinks, or when it's cooler out and you can enjoy a few drinks outside on the patio. I'll have to give the food another chance, too."
1,All I can say to sum it up is long! I got here around 7:45 and it's 10:00 and I'm still here. Not to mention that the waitress/waiter (and yes we had a multiple of servers) did not attend to us. People that got there an hour after me received their food before I.
2,"I would knock someone over for this pizza - its really, really, really good.  And I always get the chicken/pine nut salad.  It's such a simple, fresh combination and it just works.  But something ALWAYS goes awry with the delivery/service when I come here.... forgotten rolls, missing silverware, etc.  It just seems like turnover is extremely high so I'm sure its simply inexperience, but for a fast/casual place with a limited menu you'd think some things would be a given."
4,"Amazing! The woman inline next to me was back for the second time today. It's THAT good.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna appetizer and the Kale salad.  Both were amazing!  I polished it off with the Chocolate Lava Cake.  It's gluten free!  WINNING!\n\nNOTE!  The address says Grand Canyon, but it's in a little strip mall in front of Target  in the same parking lot.  If you are coming from the 215 on Flamingo, go through the light at Grand Canyon and make the next left.  You will see it on the right-hand side."
0,"I'm new to the area and had a friend visiting from out of state so we decided to try out some bars on Mill. Clearly we walked into the wrong bar. I don't know if we didn't fit the look they like to have there (trashy......?) or what? Maybe we were dressed a little too nice or something. We sat down at the bar and were ignored for a good 10 minutes and then we each ordered a Long Island. The guy comes back with our drinks in those big, red, plastic coca-cola water cups... With what tasted like pure soda. $9 sodas. Really?! And not a single other person had drinks in those giant water cups. Who serves a Long Island in a coca-cola water cup??? Stupid bartenders I guess. We asked if he could make it stronger and he rambled something about it being some percentage alcohol and then walked away. We were about to just walk out when he came over and poured a \""Long Island mix\"" into the cup. They don't even know how to make a real Long Island. Anyway, it tasted terrible although slightly stronger so we drank half of them and walked out. Will never return."
2,There is NO reason why this shouldn't run 24-7.  It doesn't open weekdays until 9am and closes around 10pm-11pm.  Weak sauce!\n\nIt's good enough for what it does in providing quick transport to Mandalay Bay to Tropicana Avenue...........but it's times leave much to be desired.
1,"Don't go here if you have small children. This is a museum for 8 and up. If you are over 8 and have a love for fire engines and their history, then this place is great. This is not a place to go if you have young children that want to climb on everything. You are not even allowed to touch the railings that surround the fire trucks. The children's exhibit and the one firetruck that you are allowed to climb on seem like an afterthought.  Beware of the old men at the front as well, they don't seem too excited to have children there."
1,"All hype.  Badly executed food.  Coffee is weak.  Food was all cold.  The potatoes were just like the ones they used to deep fry at my grade school cafeteria, were underseasoned and tasted even worse cold.  Hash, which if it's in the place's name you'd think would be good, was big but tasted so boring I almost went back to sleep.  The spongy vanilla waffle was exactly like eating a twinkie without the cream filling.  I hate twinkies and think their only redeeming quality is the cream filling.   Oddly enough, the bacon was just plain old thin sliced bacon...cold.\n\nService was good, noise level was insane, wait wasn't bad at 20 minutes."
2,"My experience in Red wok is okay. When i say okay i mean is not the restaurant's fault they hired such a clumsy busser. But anyways the food is great everything looks clean bathrooms, outside  etc! talking about the busser she was kind of rude but at the end she deserve nothing but a 0$ tip."
2,"Stopped in to get a gyro.  Friendly service and somehow related to the location on 4th downtown.  The menu has some variety from Wraps & Gyro's to Pide (Turkish Pizza) to kebaps, to regular pizza, salads and wings.  \n\nMy gyro was good.  The fries were pretty good too.  Will have to stop back and try a Pide.  The person next to us had a Pide and said it was his favorite thing on the menu."
1,"I cannot believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's, but I've been to this location three times, and all three visits have been less than stellar.  \n\nFor starters, the \""drive thru\"" system is anything but convenient.  Getting in-and-out via the drive-thru requires you to take 2 full laps around the building - the way the entrance is configured, you must enter their parking lot via the side of the property.  You then drive counter-clockwise around the building to the spot where you order.  Then you drive to get your \""food,\"" at which point you're beyond the entrance/exit spot.  So, you have to take another counter-clockwise spin around the parking lot before you can exit.\n\nIt's a terribly inefficient system, and it's somewhat dangerous, as drivers leaving the primary drive-thru lane with their food rarely look for cars circling the building trying to get to the drive-thru.  It's difficult to explain... but go there once, and you'll understand what I'm trying to describe.\n\nOk... entrance/egress aside, let's talk about this location.  It's a McDonald's, so the food is going to be exactly the same as you'd find from any other McDonald's in the world (thanks corporate farming/food prep/chemistry!), which means the service makes or breaks the experience.\n\nToday's experience was especially interesting/frustrating.  I was in Verona, helping a coworker with some home improvement work.  It was around midmorning, and his kids were in the mood for McD's.  Since I was the cleanest of the group, I volunteered to drive and pick-up the grub.  I hopped into the car and made my way over to Mickey Ds, where the drive thru was backed-up (thanks to lack of dual ordering points).\n\nWhen I reached the spot to order, I started placing the order.  I don't often go to McDonald's, so I'm not terribly familiar with the protocol... the first item on my list was identified as a \""large #3 with Coke.\""  \n\nMcD's Microphone Dude: \""Sir, Sir, Sir - I'm sorry, sir - we don't have a large size breakfast item, we only do that at lunch and dinner, sir.\""\n\nMe: \""Oh?  So they can't get a large Coke?\""\n\nMDMD: \""Sir, I'm sorry, we only have one size for breakfast - we don't have large size breakfasts.\""\n\nMe: \""Ok?  I only need a large Coke with that #3.  Not trying to Supersize or anything, just adding a large Coke.\""\n\nMDMD: \""Sir, no - sir, we don't Supersize any longer.  We have large drinks, but we don't Supersize, and we only have one size for breakfast.\""\n\nMe: \""Let's start over.  Could I have a #3 - the biscuit thing, with a Large Coke?\""\n\nMDMD: (long pause) \""Do you want a large Coke?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes, and the #3.\""\n\nMDMD: (long pause) \""So, that's a #3 with large Coke?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes.\""\n\nMDMD: \""Ok.\""\n\nMe: (long pause) \""Can I continue with the order?\""  (looked at screen thing and saw that he got the #3 with large Coke correct)\n\nMDMD: (long pause) \""Yes.\""\n\nMe: ...ordered rest of meals for friend and his kids...\n\nMDMD: Ok, if everything looks correct, proceed to the first window, where we'll have your total ready.\n\nMe: ...drives around...\n\nKid at window: \""That'll be $18.14.\""\n\nMe: \""Sorry for the confusion - I thought you could order a large beverage with your breakfast meal.\""\n\nKid at window: \""You can.\""\n\nMe: \""So, why all of the confusion?\""\n\nKid: \""I don't take the orders here, I just take the money. They take the order at the next window.\""\n\nMe: \""Oh, ok.\""\n\nSo, I go to the next window and the kid explains that he thought I wanted a large sized hash browns, and went to great length to explain that they don't have large hash browns, only regular size.  Ok, whatever...\n\nI returned to my friend's house only to discover they forgot to include the #3 part of the food order... so, we got the large Coke, but no biscuit or hash brown.  UGH!  I gave away my breakfast in the interest of not having to return.\n\n\nPrevious visits included a bout with cold/hard fries and a botched burger order (asked for onions only; got everything but onions), and a less than enthusiastic balding manager dude who seemed to act as if someone had just stomped on his toes a few seconds before I arrived to his window.\n\nThanks to this McDonald's, I'm convinced that I won't need to visit another McDonald's ever again.  I think I'll go watch Supersize Me again, just for good measure."
0,"I have been here many times because it's right by my work and convenient to go at lunch, but I'm not going anymore - it's just not worth it. \n\nif you have to wait, there is no where to sit or stand basically. everyone is packed in there like sardines. I also don't like how the nail technicians try to push all th extra services onto you when doing the pedi\n\non the last pedicure I got from them, my pinky toe was totally messed up and after about 2 weeks, my toe nails began to turn yellow (the polish that is). I hadn't been hanging out in the sun or anythign so there's no reason it should have done that. once I had the polish removed (somewhere else), my nails were fine, so it was definitely their polish. \n\nin addition, my friend had a gel manicure here and it chipped within minutes of leaving.\n\nI'm done giving this place chances"
3,"I love this place! Caked really saved my butt, they took my Birthday cake order for a Sunday (a day on which they are closed, which I didn't know!) My cake was ready on Saturday and I was able to bring it to the Restaurant for my birthday dinner the next day.\n\nI ordered a Lemon poppy seed cake with fresh strawberries and whipped cream for the filling the cake was fresh, tasty and beautiful ( (I will include a photo!) Caked was recommended to me by Retro bakery as they were booked for the day but I will always recommend Caked!  They also gave us some coffee cookies to taste which were delicious!!"
4,"Ate dinner here one night, and was so pleased. This restaurant is not over packed with people that making reservations even that night were available and I love that about a restaurant. I ordered the lamb, and it was very delicious and didn't take forever to cook like most restaurants. The side orders are ordered a la cart, and priced at 12 dollars. There not huge but good sharable size. There have a few choices in dessert, i choose the berry option, and it was very fresh and delicious, i believe all desserts were priced at 12 dollars as well. They have a large wine and drink selection. \n\nThe atmosphere is very nice and relaxing, not to stuffy and uptight, all the waiters and managers were nice and friendly making recommendations if asked. \nThis steak house is located inside Cesar's hotel and casino."
2,"I recently watched this show for the second time since I saw it once w/o my husband and he really wanted to see it. The show is definitely different from your typical cirque du soleil shows. This one is more focused on Asian themed/ sword fighting/acrobatics. Most cirque du soleil show is like watching a dream with really no plot just different acts of crazy \""sitting on the edge of chair\"" acrobatics. But KA actually has a storyline and nothing was really scary cause they used wires.\n\nThe language they use and some characters (ie the Tarzan-ish guy) is just hard to take in. Even watching it the second time, it's not my kind of cirque du soleil, so I'm glad for both times I was able to get the tickets for a cheap price.\n\nThe only thing I really like about the show is the big platform that can go vertical and move around. The last scene with the fighting on the vertical wall was my favorite, but the other parts didn't catch my attention like the other shows do."
2,"Espect\u00e1culo entretenido, las chicas bailan muy bien, pero se ve que los guionistas se fumaron algo cuando idearon el gui\u00f3n.\nMickey es el mas divertido de los actores."
3,"Wow this is a really nice place. I've never visited this cinema before, but I was surprised. The restrooms are clean and modern, the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar. I will go back to this theatre for sure."
4,"My back yard, nice close scenic hiking trails for all of the family to enjoy! Not many people on the trails, they're well maintained."
4,"Love it. Simply elegant food that is cooked to perfection. We were lucky to get good seats next to the window that overlooks the Bellagio fountain that made the meal extra special. The servers were numerous. We had a different person for almost every type of service; one guy who pours the water, another who seats you, another who takes your order, another who brings out the dish. It was very fun to get pampered. \n\nWe split the spaghetti and ordered mushrooms and brocollini as sides. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce is creamy with great flavors. Really a satisfying meal despite it's simplicity. The sides are as amazing as the main dish if not more! Again, we didn't order anything too exciting but the flavors are spot on. \n\nWill definitely come again and look forward to having the same dishes all over again."
2,I come here all the time with my son who loves the chicken tenders.  Food is 'OK' although my favorite is the BK stacker which seems to have gotten smaller and smaller over the past few years and the price is probably higher.  Well overall the price is still pretty cheap depending on what you go for so I will always consider BK when I need a cheap meal.
0,"My first review was filtered and will continue to post my review until it is not!! This place is HORRIBLE. Here is my original review!\nWent to the one in Ceasars forum shops, great service when your in the store but it ends the second you walk out the door. Bought a pair of Frankie B jeans and when i was packing to leave Vegas the next day found the security tag was still on them (which shocked me as i walked out the store and in 3 other stores without any alarms going off) tried to call the store and left multiple messages since no one seems to answer the phone EVER there. Didnt get a call back until 2 days later after i was already back in Chicago. I didnt even get an apology, was just oh well find someone to take it off, found a store here that would take it off and discovered the nasty hole left in the jeans... mind you these are 165 dollar jeans that now have a hole in them. Will never shop there again!"
4,Excellent pizza and great service.  The Mediterranean Pizza and Moscato wine both get 5 stars.
3,"I've been out to a few different Duckworth's locations now and they seem to do a good job at keeping their atmosphere and service above par without being \""cookie-cutter\"" by any means. \n\nI came out to this location after work one day and took advantage of the all drafts $3.50 special. Great place to come out for a few drinks with co-workers, but also looks like a fresh joint for low-key nightlife. I haven't had their food here yet, but assuming it is on the same quality level as the other locations, you won't be disappointed.\n\nAgain, the atmosphere and service shine here. TV's all over for good sports coverage on associated game days."
0,My experience this time was not good my daughter tried on a costume and it was ripped before she tried it on they wanted me to purchase this I was going to a holloween party after. The owner was very rude i told him Im going to buy my kid a costume  but not the riped one i also said my brothers are going to purches costumes too The owner said you don't need to purches anything in my store.Every  year I shop here FOR KNOW THIS WON'T BE THE PLACE VERY BAD CUSTUMER SERVICE !
2,Went to Shadow Bar after Rao's and before Pure nightclub. Wasn't too bad. I liked being able to sit and hear the people I was with. It's a pretty small bar and was starting to get a bit packed later on. The big draw back here is that the drinks are super expensive! Good place to stop by and have a drink before going to the club.
4,"I use yelp to find what I need. And it did it came through again! I have seen Dr. Sharma a few times now. I can get same day appointment, it was odd at first but I'm so happy I can do that. The wait time is not long at all. I can see myself seeing the doctor more frequently now because of just those two reasons. Who wants to make an appointment with a doctor that is crazy busy that you can't be seen until a week or two when you call? Or wait so long in the waiting room because they double book? I think that's why us patients mostly wait until we have several issues just to avoid the hassle. And let's not forget, he's very thorough! He doesn't rush you out, he'll answer any question you have. I have recommended him and will continue to do so. So far that person is happy with him too. I thank the reviewers on yelp, because if you guys hadn't posted the comments, I wouldn't have ever known about him! And I also thank Dr. Sharma for providing great service!"
0,"Absolutely terrible food. Paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me. The wait staff are superb, and very nice. The Orleans has other places to eat on site, so avoid this one at all cost."
1,"This was the first place open serving food that was close by our hotel once we got settled in. We split an order of nachos, which were HUGE! The late night crowd was there, and they had the lights turned down and the music blaring. Not the atmosphere I expected."
0,This place is going down the drain. Sad. Great food but service has went down the drain. Won't be back!!
2,"Great park. I just moved to the area from Old Town Scottsdale and was delighted when I was told about this park. People are super friendly and way more down to earth than those who frequent Chaparral Dog Park. I have a husky mix who loves this park and all the friends she makes whenever we come :-)\n\nPS: If you meet a nice older gentleman named Kirke who asks to photograph you and your dog, your picture will go here: http://thepacknews.webs.com/ to his super cute dog park website!!!"
3,"While not nearly as big as Scottsdale Fashion Square, Kierland Commons is a good eating/shopping destination if you are in North Scottsdale.  If you are staying at the Westin, you can easily walk, drive, or take the free Westin shuttle.\n\nThe design and layout tries to evoke the idea of a small town center with streets running through the mall.  It's compact enough that even old folks or people with kids can walk around the whole thing without feeling overwhelmed (assuming it's not too hot).  The stores are all mid- to high-end with a range of things from fashion (Guess, Michael Kors) to home goods (Sur La Table, Crate and Barrell), and the restaurants range from family friendly chain restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, P.F. Chang's) to local restaurants (North, Greene House) to high end steak/fish house (Mastro's Ocean Club)."
2,"I'm still not quite sure how I feel about this place. So I'm new to the area and was looking for a clear broth noodle soup. When I asked the server if he had anything like that he said they have wonton soup and I had a look of disappointment on my face, yet he was quick to recommend that the chef can make a lo mein soup and suggested a tofu seafood soup. The fact that he offered to make something off the menu deserves an extra star. It had noodles and extremely large portion but the soup was thick like egg drop soup. It didn't hit the spot to me but it tasted good. It just wasn't what I was looking for. It also looked like the server was the only one there. Poor guy, so he didn't check up on me and took awhile to get my check and billed out. So I didn't hate the place and I'm sure I'll be back to try other things."
4,I've been coming to Cosmo nails now since June and I have to say this place is absolutely my new favorite shop and I wouldn't go anywhere else. It's the best one in NLV. Everyone does an amazing job as well. Kudos!!
2,"There's not much to be said about the pizza here except that it is comparatively cheap, quick, and is no frills. Whether you're tired of overpaying for things on the strip or want to get late night grub without a reservation, this is your place. Free water and condiments, and you get to tease everyone at the Cosmopolitan with your cheap yet filling pizza. Can't go wrong."
1,Overpriced and mediocre quality sushi. They crank the rolls out very fast so that's good...but also bad because they're not put together too well.
4,"Delicious pizza, desserts and good selection of wines. They have wine bottle specials on Mondays and we will be checking that out for the first time today. Been there on a handful of times and have never been disappointed. My mother in law suffers from celiac, she has to have their gluten free crust and says it's the best she's had anywhere. She's from New Jersey so it must be pretty decent"
3,"First of all, Downtown Las Vegas is NOT dead. It is under \""cultural reconstruction.\"" Golden Nugget is a Las Vegas gem. I know my papa hung down here in his day and I feel a bit nostalgic hanging in the same spots. The fixtures I am sure have changed a bit, but they still feel a bit old school, and the rooms have that old Vegas feel as well. The suites are awesome. Actually, I have never seen the regular rooms, so maybe the entire hotel is suites. I like the poker crowd here as well...they all seem to be better players than on the strip. I've seen a few pros at the big table, and a few big shot athletes too! Unfortunately, they were playing at the big boys table and I was at the kiddie's. The location is great for downtown bars, and I suggest getting a room on First Friday's. You can party all night then crash at a hotel room as opposed to crashing on the freeway at four am. Just a safety suggestion. The Golden Nugget is a classic visit downtown and worth checking out if you are in the area."
1,"When we were there around Thanksgiving time we asked the front desk staff to recommend a place to eat nearby the hotel and they suggested this place.  The decor is charming and it went downhill from there.\n\nThe hostess acted like she was doing us a favor leading us to our table.  The main server was short on attentiveness and personality but his assistant was a joy.  He made sure water glasses were filled and more bread was brought out when we asked for it and he always had a smile.  We saw him more than the main in white jacket server guy.  \n\nThe food was no big deal for the price.  It was just adequate.  Where they totally dropped the ball was desert!  I ordered the warm pineapple upside down cake.  I assumed warm cake meant it was brought out to you warm.  Ummmmmmmm, no! It was cake that was brought out to the table and then presented flambe.\n\nNow flambe is one thing and I have no issues with it.  Having the dish placed in front of me, the server pouring the flammable liquid on it and splashing me with it and then lighting the thing in front of my OMG am I going to have a Michael Jackson hair on fire moment here - not cool!!!\n\nThe pineapple on the cake melted so much that it was too gooey to chew and the taste of the rum was more than I could take.  Normally when something is presented flambe they pour the liquid and light the dish AWAY from you and the alcohol evaporates enough before you try and eat it.  I could only manage a couple of forkfuls before I shoved it away.  I contacted the management later and we had a nice discussion especially about how not to scare the *&^% out of a customer with flames.\n\nWould we go back to this place when we return to Arizona? How about no."
2,"Wen't to Capital Grille for my birthday dinner. I hadn't been here since I was in High School. From what I remembered it was really good. Of course everything is a la carte. I ended up only having Lobster Mac and Cheese. (I'd already had a recovery meal after party #1) It was okay. Could have used a boost in flavor somewhere. Maybe some salt. My biggest concern was my drink. Is that bad? I'm concerned with my drink. Anyway, I ordered a Sidecar. It came in a goblet style glass full of ice. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. Are Sidecars not to be served up? With actual Cognac? I figured Capital would know better than that. Other than that my large group was served well. They even threw some berries on a platter with my cake that my friends brought. Nice touch. Oh, and we saw celebrities, like face to face. Thank goodness CIAA will be back for six more years!!"
3,"Barron's is our favorite pizza place in Anthem. The toppings are good, the service and selection are good, and the pizza isn't as salty as many pizza places."
0,Service sucks. They are always messing up orders and are rude to customers. One of their workers was just yelling at a kid for bringing in his skateboard and told him to have consideration. So rude and unprofessional.
0,"I went here with a friend today.  It just wasn't worth the price.  The boba was not terrrible or anything special.  I ordered the boba milk tea and my friend ordered the green milk tea.  It came in these cool jars. However, the food was not worth the price.  We each ordered an appetizer.  She ordered popcorn chicken which was $5, and it was only like 15 pieces of chicken.  My chicken wings had a little bit more.  It had four pieces.  I just didn't feel that the food was worth it.  I might try different kinds of drinks later on, though."
4,"Rodney Reyes is the real deal! When you think of a magician you think of a person capable of doing the impossible. And let me tell you Rodney was doing the impossible at this private event held a at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, Las Vegas in a gorgeous suite. My friend who works in the biochem industry invited me to this event, where I met Rodney. He borrowed my signed quarter and right in front of me, concentrated as it melted in my hand. IMPOSSIBLE! Then he took my cellphone made it vanish and re-appear in to a sealed box that was in full view the whole time. I've seen all the big vegas shows and all the tv magic but nothing can make give your an experience so visceral you'll be talking about it for years! Fantastic magician worth while finding his shows or booking him for an astonishing experience!"
3,"Being the lone vegan (as per usual) in our group, I thought it would perhaps be wise to hurriedly scarf down some lunch before we descended upon a BBQ joint.  And a quick Yelp search led me here. \n\nI ordered the Lunasagna, which apparently only required 15-20 minutes to prep, so I assume it has been at least partially pre-made because my other \""raw food\"" experiences did require a bit of patient waiting.  I also picked up a couple of raw cookie duo packets upon retrieving my styrofoam box because I was intrigued.  Definitely not one of those thriftier lunches at around $25 with tip, but it's not often I treat myself to raw vegan deliciousness.  \n\nMy advice is to not expect a typical lasagna because you'll surely be disappointed.  It's more like a generous pat of creamy nuts, raw tomato paste, and herbs (I tasted mint).  The raw zucchini isn't very flavorful itself, the tomato was probably the most potent flavor.  I love tomato of all kinds, so I was rather fond of the Lunasagna.  The raw lasagna I had forever ago in Austin may have been tastier but this was a perfect lunch and fueled me along for a rather busy day.  The accompanying side salad was pretty great as well, but I think the it was the amazing salad dressing that in fact won me over.\n\nSo here's a tip, the cookies consists mainly of coconut, so if you hate coconut, stay far far away.  They weren't too delectable, but I think they were super for random nibbles before I relocated to carnivores terroritory."
3,"This mammoth furniture/homegoods store can be daunting... and you can waste away hours on end in here looking at everything from door knobs to silverware to silverware to lights. **ADVICE-print out a list FIRST, you can do so at www.ikea.com! AND you don't have to go through the showroom/display room first either, you can skip ahead to the \""meat\"" of the store if you just go to the left and/or downstairs from the cafeteria (they have really good food! and it's CHEAP!). \n\nAlso-when you go to write the numbers down off the item you want on your list IN STORE-use the numbers that look like an IP address (example: 201.846.47) and write down the isle and bin numbers... you have to find your items in the warehouse portion before checkout and this makes your life so much easier!!!\n\nWe found some unbelievably good deals and the instructions are so easy to follow to put your new furniture/accessories together! Can't wait to go back and check out their holiday decorations! Love this place!"
0,"Chive dumplings were ok. Fried rice was bland and too greasy, beef stew was alright, and the chicken ginger noodle soup was very bland and chicken was too dry."
1,"Mr. Flay, I thoroughly respect your culinary skills but this place is an embarrassment. We were extremely excited to go to one of your restaurants for the first time but I don't think we'll be back anytime soon.\n\nWe went for lunch and I had the barbecued ribs for an app. They tasted like something you'd find at a school's cafeteria lunch. They looked like they had been sitting under a warming light for a few hours to add insult to industry.\n\nNext up were the \""smoked shrimp tacos.\"" I wasn't aware smoked means charred/burnt. They lacked any remnant of palatable flavor. The two tortillas were quite generous of you.   \n\nThe service was just as horrendous. The waiter pretty much never came by and I cleared off the table myself to make way for the food.\n\nLastly, another reviewer had it right about the location inside the casino. You're sitting right by the sports betting so you can hear people screaming and cheering every now again. The biggest issue for me was the cigarette smoke. It wafts in from the casino floor and make the eating experience that much more gross.\n\nSuggestion: go to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant instead. Maybe Iron Chef's just shouldn't have restaurants and stick to the Food Channel."
1,"Good service, pretty quick - but a total ripoff if you're looking for anything but a top - to - tails oil, fluid, filter change and detail experience. I'm a do-it-yerselfer on a lot of car stuff, so I wanted to come here for a simple oil change, and was told that that was not an option. I ended up spending 90 bucks for the whole shebang, and although the car looked great when they were finished (had an hour to wait that day, but Pappa's was withing walking distance, win!!) the fact that I wasn't given more options as to the level of service I required pissed me off."
2,"Wow, lots of hate on here about this place. Gave me second thoughts about coming here, but we had coupons. Service was very good.  Food was reasonably good, but that's kind of what you expect from a chain. I had the chicken under a brick, and it was just fine.  I didn't care for what my Mom got (chicken scallopini, I think), but she likes that. My wife had the eggplant Parmesan and enjoyed it as well."
3,"While I normally would shy away from anything called \""Lube Chips\"", cause, you know, it's got the word \""Lube\"" in it. And imaging something like a \""Lube Chip\"" in my 7th grade-like mind just doesn't sound right.  \n\nBut they're actually good.  \n\nFor that matter, the whole restaurant is good.  Plus they have a car mounted sideways on the wall.  Seriously.  It's solidly hung too.  I checked.  It's not going anywhere.\n\nWhat I appreciate is unlike other wing-establishments of their kind, their sauce names actually line up to their heat.  If you order a medium hot sauce, it's not mild nor hot.  Their Arizona Ranch sauce is a spectacular mix of medium-ish sauce with ranch dressing.  \n\nFor entrees, I'm a fan of the wrap and my wife has actually gotten the steak a couple of times.  She was pleased.\n\nThe adult beverages are reasonably priced and a good selection too.  \n\nService has always been good for me.  \n\nNow I'm thinking I am going to go there after work.  See what writing this review has done for me?"
1,"2.5\n\nIf you left Rock Bottom wishing you had paid more money for your food, then The Liberty can fill that void.\n\nPaid $7 for two soft pretzels and a thimble full of beer cheese.\n\nFor the main course: $18 for a bowl of fries with some steak mixed in.\n\nAlso, I usually like a $6 dessert to be larger than the credit card I am paying for it with.\n\nService isn't bad. Value isn't there."
3,"Princes Street is great, and so is the rest of the city centre shops - but when I need everything in one place, as well as some shops which just arent big enough for my needs in the city centre, or perhaps not even there at all- I come to Fort Kinnaird.\n\nIts basically just a car park or two with a huge amount of shops around its edges - but as I said they are big super stores, and some of them are the only ones in miles. Really, its quite a drab place, but if there is something you need that just isnt available in the city centre, come here - it has everything, and even though it is a pain to get to, its worth it."
4,"Yes, you can find a cheaper tire. I like this place because they offer a warranty and a bunch of other services with your tire purchase.\n\nAnother great thing - I was literally out of there in less than 15 minutes! Extra star for their awesome service!"
3,"I've always enjoyed Oregano's. Who doesn't like their pizza and pasta dishes or their pazooki (i always share the half and half)?!\n\nBut recently, I found my favorite dish ever and will order it every time I go. After I realized how much I enjoyed it, I found out it's the healthiest thing on the menu! Or at least that's what someone told me. Either way - the Big Beefstro Salad is what I will be ordering from now on. It's filled with shaved rib-eye, jalapenos, sweet onions and a sweet serrano dressing atop the greens.\n\nOh, and sometimes I like to indulge in the Dirty Monkey - it's delicious, but strong."
4,I love this place! My wife and I go at least once a week and just last weekend did the party bus trip to the Cardinals game. They do something new every few months which makes it a great way to meet old friends and make new ones.
0,"A company that used to have great customer service and on-time flights that has deteriorated to unacceptable levels. I used to fly them almost exclusively but wondering if your plane is going to arrive with each trip forced me to switch. And anytime you had to talk to someone good luck...they always seemed annoyed when dealing with customers. That was 2 years ago. \n\nAdvance to 2014 and I have some miles left that if I don't use I forfeit. So I decided to take a trip to Vegas. The flight out was only a few minutes late - not bad. The return flight? Well I'm still waiting to get home and I'm on standby for the next 2 flights - both of which are oversold. Tried to work with an agent to see that my options were and rudeness and lack of empathy don't begin to describe her behavior. Never even an apology - no service recovery attempt at all. I've written to their customer service department and will update this review when/if I get a response. \n\nSo this will be the absolute last time I use this airline and gladly so. Even a \""free\"" trip using miles isn't worth the way I've been treated today. \n\nUse a competitor - you'll be better off. Good luck out there."
1,"They do a pretty good job, but honestly, the blond woman who i believes owns the place is pretty rude and not very friendly. Next time I plan to drive a bit farther and go to Cobblestone which actually is a little cheaper anyway."
2,"This place will do well because it's trendy and modern inside. A cool ambiance..the food is just ok. The hash browns had way too much salt in them. The mushroom, spinach scramble was dry and bland.. Huevos Rancheros were just ok. But hey, it's probably a hip place to be so food is secondary I guess."
4,"Charlie is really friendly. If you introduce yourself, he will call you by name everytime you come back. The food is all really tasty. I'm partial to the house chili, but everything I've had there has been good. I think it's kind of healthy. I know it's inexpensive. And all the hot dishes come out piping hot, which is reassuring from a food safety perspective. You have to wonder about that aspect at competing restaurants."
4,"They make mulled wine on demand. Just ask. Yes, even after Christmas is over!\nThat sums up how great the service is, and the atmosphere or menu won't leave you disappointed either."
4,"Went back today for the first time since moving across town...got a soy latte and pastry. As usual, the staff was incredible. The soy latte cannot be beat...as Jason S. mentioned, they are one of the only places in town that can do a soy latte correctly.\n\nI did notice a sign that their muffins are all $1 and cookies are $1.50 after 4pm - though you have to pay in cash.  This makes me want to go back at 4pm just to get the leftovers...they are amazing! \n\nToday I saw, a true sign of a real coffee shop...two groups of people engaged in conversations about current issues..."
2,"Our waiter was the best, funny and point. We were there around 8pm. Place was packed. Once waiter took our order it long to get our food. The food was ok. I ordered the Lasagne it was good. I had better.  Their portiions are big. I was not able to eat half of it. Also to heavy to have this late. I could not sleep.\nThe desserts were very good. I will for sure be back for the desserts."
4,"Another yelp success! It's about 12 minutes away from the strip. We ordered everything that was recommended to us - curry duck and fried ice cream. All items were amazing. If we lived in the area we would be back. Go here, you wont be disappointed."
1,"We have been to this location multiple times previously to have my boyfriend's hair cut. Each time we visit is a guessing game as to whether or not he will get a good hair stylist or not. He has been four times and each time their is a different staff and hair stylist available. His previous visit to this review was not good either so it appears we will be looking for a new place to get his hair cut. \n\nThis last visit was the worst as his hair was butchered beyond immediate correction. I suggest next time my boyfriend really take the time and look his hair over and make sure it is cut the way he requested. That way they can make any changes or corrections to it because once you leave you have accepted the cut even if was done crappy. It was really bad after I examined it later at home, half of the hair was cut uneven with one side longer than the other. I had to take my hair scissors to it later at home and trying to correct a bad cut is hard to do if you are not an experienced hair stylist or barber.\n\nOK so he went around  looking even more goofy and nerdy for two weeks until it grew out so lesson learned!"
2,"First time here and I had the VIP pedi for 42 dollars. They have pedicures  starting at $22 but I thought what the hell, treat myself.  Yen was the person I got and she did a great job. Yen took her time and it didn't  feel rushed. I will return to have Yen work on my toes. Yen should get 5 stars. I give 3 overall  because I have been in better message chairs. These didn't  seem to have many options on the control."
4,"I moved to Phoenix 2 months before my wedding and had to find somewhere to have my wedding dress alterations done. I relied on the Yelp reviews and took it to Valentina, and I'm so glad I did! She did an amazing job and was so great to work with! She was able to work within my schedule and was always happy to make any extra adjustments to make sure it was perfect. I also appreciated that she did not ask me to pay a single dime until I was completely satisfied, and she took great care of my dress while it was in her posession. I don't plan on getting married again, but I would definitely use Valentina for any other tailoring I might need, and I would recommend her to everyone!"
1,"Not a huge fan of this Ross. If I'm in the area, I'll check it out but they aren't particularly well-stocked and their aisles are a bit on the messy side. \n\nFrom time to time I'll find a good buy, but for the most part I leave empty-handed. This is a rarity for me when I visit Ross. Definitely not one of the better options in town, but worth a stop from time to time."
4,"Portillos my love. Any Chicagoan knows and loves Portillos! That being said I've tried many a replica restaurants of places I used to eat back home and usually they arnt the same something is always a little off, but not at portillos. Fresh strawberry shakes or a cake shake if you dare. Beef and cheddar extra gravy please! Portillos makes being away from home just a bit more bare able."
2,"Ok, so the Oxtail soup is the special here, BUT it's basically only served from 11pm til 11am, which covers the hours for the average drunkie's evening mealtime.  I wonder how many of the previous reviews are based on a drunken experience with the oxtail soup.  It is pretty good I'll admit albeit a LOT on the salty side.  Served with a large sccop of rice, side of ginger and onions.  For $7.95 it's not tOOoo bad, but cost vs. quality i would have to give it a 2 star rating.\n\nThe breakfast buffet is quite cheap- for around 6 dollars you have quite a selection of meats (portugese sausage, bacon, ham, corned beef hash) carbs (crepe things, toast, waffles, danishes, hash browns) and fresh fruits and juice and such."
2,"There are *way* cheaper all you can eat sushi deals in Vegas than here if you're looking to be on the conservative side with your hard earned money. I don't know about anyone else, but unless the sushi quality is top notch and the dining experience comes with the 360 degree service and quality, I absolutely refuse to pay $25-$28 for all you can eat when I know I can get it for at/under $23 elsewhere where I don't have to wait 20/30 minutes to be sat. \n\nWhile their sushi and plates are interesting, I honestly don't see anything overly special about this place. Small, always seems to be mobbed, and while the service is good, it is nothing overly outstanding like some of my friends raved to me about.\n\nThe reason why I gave it three stars is because 1.) The prices are a little over the top for something you can get cheaper (and in a better setting) somewhere else, and 2.) This place is always busy, and the wait times are very much over-quoted and long."
0,The course itself is a great course. But when you drop $60.00 to play it and at the second tee you have 10 people standing there waiting to tee off it is obvious that the course management has over booked the course and don't give a darn about you waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting between and during holes. We left with four holes left as it was ridiculous. Will never play there again. If I could get a refund I would. I do not recommend playing there. Oh yes we were the 5th group off after the course had been completely cleared from a shot gun start tournament. So it was clearly over booking at its best.
1,Its ok compared to the restaurants in Socal. the service is average. but i don't know if its just me but it seems like the wings taste different.
4,We are from Seattle where we have amazing sushi so we're pretty particular.  This was hands down probably the best sushi and rolls I've ever had.  I will definitely be going back when I'm in Vegas!
4,"\""Must be born on or before today's date, 1991, to purchase alcohol\"" \n\nWELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLl what do you know about that. APRIL FOOLS BABY I'M THE 21 and YOU WILL SERVE ME WELL! \n\nHaha, they're pretty good about checking your ID, so make sure you have that handy, so you can get started on your Fat Tuesday on Sunday morning!! It was pretty short of amazing. Take your pick on cups and get started because once you have the cup, you can just keep coming back for more! \n\nMy all time favorite is the 44 Magnum (190 Octane & Hurricane). A mixture of Orange Juice and Vodka-190 O and the Hurr- is a Strawberry and Rum Daiquiri. Noms, you really feel it in the slushy. You're all thinking that it's cute like something you get from Seven-11, but really it's absolutely delicious and wonderful, especially in that Las Vegas heat! There's a list of most enjoyed mixes, or you can create your own! For a dollar, it's an extra shot in your drink in a test tube. It's cute and a tad bit hard to get the vodka out, so I just waited until I was at the end of my daiquiri before unleashing that shot! \n\nIt's at a continent location, in Mandalay Bay by shopping and hotels and casinos and they take cups and do refills from anywhere. It's the only Fat Tuesday in that general area, since the rest are Evening Call, but it's worth it and the prices are usually under 20$. The refills are like 11$ and under, so not bad not bad. Like a mini alcoholic slushy paying mini bar.\n\nI will be back. And you should come try, especially if you're thirsty.  \n(PS. I wasn't hurting the next time, even with the shots. I probably needed even more!)\nNot to mention, since it is Vegas, they take pretty much most forms of payment in terms of cards and cash!"
2,"I only get the carmel flan...they hit the spot but I've had better...for the $2 price, you can't go wrong with that."
1,"I've lived in PGH for a year now and really don't know a whole lot of history about the region. So going to the Heinz History Center made sense. After passing by billboards for the Pittsburgh's sunken steamboat the Arabia I decided to go. I had been in the great hall of the building, which is super gorgeous, so my hopes were high. I brought my 5 year old on Memorial Day and delighted to find out his admission was free, but mine was 15 bucks. The steamboat exhibit for the Arabia was decent. The kid's areas were boring and my kid was quickly over them. The museum isn't terrible but its seems to have old school exhibit styles in this  modern chic loft space. Some of the exhibits were more modern and well- presented and others were just those corny mannequins with blurbs. Maybe I struggled to find the cohesion in the lay out here. The most interesting part for me was the exhibit on items from Pittsburghs ethnic neighborhoods.\n2-3 stars."
3,"The new girl I had last time isn't here today, but the owner is here, checking on her stores, I recognize her from the web site.  She is busy talking back and forth with the staff, but all the while, they are taking excellent care of my brows!  I use the punch card each time I come, so I am at my free threading after today's visit!  Great service, huge waiting area, and never busy!"
3,This is as good as it gets in Arizona.  We had a great time eating lunch in the really lovely place.  Joe who owns the place chatted us up and was just great.  He made us a great expresso drink and charmed everyone at the table.  It felt like I was in LA or San Francisco.  What a great little place!!! I only get to AZ a few times a year but will make a effort to stop by every time.
3,"I've visited Fez and few times and plan to put it on regular rotation now that I've moved back to Phx.  Tasty and inventive food, good service, really nice atmosphere."
3,"A hidden jem! Get the cajun fish tacos, so delicious!  The chips were crisp and not stale and the salsa a touch spicy loke I like it.   Pacifico is only $2.95 for a 16oz draft, it doesnt get any be than that!"
4,"I can't say enough about how much I love this studio. I gave the studio a try on the insistence of one of my friends who has been practicing there for a while. We tried an initial class together and the rest is history- I'm hooked! \n\nThere are so many things about the studio that I love. The location is perfect in Plaza Midwood and there is ample parking. Upon walking in, there is always a friendly face to greet you at the door. Sometimes there is even a puppy face to greet you which is even better. :-) The check in process is quick and easy with a scanable key chain card. There are cubby holes to put your stuff into and plenty of areas to change, grab water and get ready. \n\nThe hot yoga studio (A) is huge and beautiful! Hardwood floors and red brick walls stretching up to high ceilings. The decorations are fun and tasteful and fit with the vibe of the studio. There are parking spots for mats not uncomfortably close to your neighboring mat. There are no mirrors on the walls as the instructors coach you through looking at your body and feeling your way through a pose as opposed to focusing on how it looks. \n\nWhen the class is ready to begin the instructor introduces themselves and gets you started in your first pose. The instructors speak through the class re-inforcing the Baptiste yoga principles through the practice and always add so much to think about (and often laugh about) through the practice. After a short warm up (which you might be surprised is just a warm up) they start the class with an \""Om\"". This was new to me and I really wasn't sure how I felt about it at first, so I didn't do it the first few classes which wasn't an issue at all. Everyone is focused on their own practice so you're very free to go where you want to in your practice. Next the flow sequence begins. It's challenging, hot and rewarding. Coming from a studio that heated their room to 105-110 degrees, I love the temps being between 95-100. Hot enough to warm up the muscles and get a good sweat going, but not so hot that it's distracting. \n\nEach class is different. Different instructors bring a different experience to each class. Surprisingly I found that I enjoy the 90 minute classes the most and there are certain instructors that I will happily rearrange my schedule to make their class. (Daniel, David, Sally, Liz....) Each class offers a wide variety of options for your practice from modifications to poses to moving into advanced poses. Where you bring your practice is up to you and there is no judgement regardless of what you decide! Sometimes I'll move into side crow from chair twist, other times I'll happily sit in chair twist and regardless of what I do I feel great about it. \n\nThe instructors are encouraging and never fail to challenge you to push your limits. They emphasize matching breath with movement and proper pose aligment. They and the assistants are happy to come over and help you in any pose. Oh the assistants- one of the best things about Y1! Each of the assistant in class (from one to three!) is specially trained to come around and assist you in your poses. Each assist feels like a mini-massage and is just wonderful- not to mention helpful to find your place in a pose. :-) \n\nEnding the practice with Savasana the lights are turned down, the fans turned on and a cold lavendar washcloth set at the top of your mat to place on your face (or whereever you like) to assist with cooling you down. \n\nI've taken the 60minute, 90 minute and deep stretch classes and enjoyed all of them. I'm very excited to start taking the Wednesday night foundational classes to become more acquainted with proper pose alignment. They also offer fantastic workshops- seems to be every weekend and other group activities. I love their committment to the community and local charities. \n\nCan't think of anything negative to say! (Unless you talk to me the days that I'm so sore I can barely move- but even then I feel great!!)"
3,"Food is very good, the owners are very friendly.  I would have given them a 5-star however it typically takes 10-20 minutes to get your food (and this is simple mexican food), secondly they don't have free chips & salsa.  Their Texax Burrito and the Al Pastor plate are both very good."
3,"This place is my guilty pleasure. The food is not really healthy but it tastes so good. I try to stay away from this place but I can't. I have probably tried 3/4 of the menu and I haven't had anything I didn't like. Chicken fingers, Italian beef, hamburgers, fish, cheese sticks, shrimp, Philly cheese steak are all great. Mild sauce is just like Chicago. The fries are good too, lightly battered and crispy. Prices are very good. Highly recommended."
4,"I am really hard to please and I was very impressed. The remodel is great. There are lots of different areas inside and outside where you can enjoy all the TVs and music. I love the food, the service was outstanding\nand I really liked the books all over the place. I can see myself hanging here a lot."
4,"Home away from home. Great selection of Cigars, wrist watches and shaving products. Great place to hang out and have a smoke and watch sports on 6 large tv screens. No membership fees and you can also store you collection in the back room free of charge. Highly recommend Cigar King."
0,"I with Toni B. as I would like to give English Dermatology Center (i.e. Paul English Dermatology) ZERO stars if I could.\n\nAfter dealing with the cold/unresponsive staff on a number of occasions both for myself and my daughter with both of us having similar issues and experiences, with needing to come back repeatedly for \""Another followup Appointment\"" to get another billable procedure on their books.\n\nYesterday I called because the prescription they had written to me at my December 5th 2011 appointment, was no longer available.  The company stopped making Tetracycline and there has literally been none made since June 2011 (See Link: http://www.ashp.org/DrugShortages/Current/bulletin.aspx?id=816 )\n\nRemember they gave me the prescription in December 2011, about 1/2 a year since Tetracycline was being made but that is another issue.  I was able to get the first few months of the prescription filled with some assistance of a very helpful pharmacist but she could no long locate any left over supplies of Tetracycline after March of so of 2012.\n\nI was able to go until about mid October 2012 with what Tetracycline I had on hand.  My prescription is good for this until Dec 31, 2012 or about two months and change.\n\nSo I could get two more 30 day supplies on the prescription before my prescription runs out.\n\nHere is the KICKER and why I WILL NOT BE GO BACK TO English Dermatology Center, when I called and explained the situation about Tetracycline not being made anymore and I need to have the remainder of my prescription changed to an equivalent prescription, they said they would NOT be able to do the change to the prescription because Mindy (the Physician Assistant) doesn't renew prescriptions if they haven't seen you in the last 12 months.\n\nI explained that I was there about 10 months ago and there was total silence on the phone.  They said they would have to call me back.  They then called and said that they would only renew the prescription until December 4, 2012 (one year exactly to the day) and I would have to come in and PAY ANOTHER MEDICAL APPOINTMENT FEE to get my prescription renewed through the last 26 days of December 2012.\n\nRemember I'm just trying to get the original prescription, thru Dec. 31, 2012, changed to something that is actually being made and actually available but all English Dermatology Center wants to do is get me in the door for ANOTHER BILLABLE APPOINTMENT.\n\nEnglish Dermatology Center IS WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  English Dermatology Center can't keep their word and give me the prescription equivalent for the same time, December 31, 2012, they authorized previously because they just want to FORCE YOU TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND TAKE YOUR MONEY!\n\nDon't think that because you have insurance that your and I are not paying for it.   English Dermatology Center's process and forced appointment practices are exactly why the cost of Employer-Sponsored health insurance premiums have more than doubled in the last 9 years, a rate 3 times faster than cumulative wage increases.\n\nDo yourself and your family a favor and, if you use English Dermatology Center, FIND A DIFFERENT DERMATOLOGIST or if you are looking for a dermatologist, definitely DO NOT USE English Dermatology Center."
3,Very good soup and fish dishes.
0,"Pinks, i expected more from you! \nI stood in lines 2 hours for you in LA and thought you were a little better than average. Then i come to Las Vegas to try you again with barley any lines, and you were not great to me at all! I am totally breaking up with you. \n\nI tried the spicy dog and chilli cheese fries. Both were okay and had nothing special about them. This place is small, expensive for what you get, and seating is only outside. This place is truly overrated."
0,Horrible customer service skills. Linda that helped us need a attitude adjustment. \nWon't go back to this location.
3,"Delicious dishes with generous portions.  Their Peruvian purple corn drink, chica, is also delicious, and tastes a bit like hibiscus tea rather than a \""corn drink\"".  We ate here on a Friday, and tried their roast chicken.  It was juicy, tender, flavored with herbs and roasted just right.  We had fish ceviche as an appetizer, and it was nicely piquant, marinated with citrus/lime flavor.  I tried some lomo saltado as well, and the beef was tender, and packed with flavor.  Service was friendly, but a bit slow.  I will definitely be dining here again!"
1,"I had the eggplant parmagiana with pasta.  I liked the eggplant but didn't care for the penne with sauce.  The sauce has nothing going for it.  My companion ordered one of his favorites, chicken marsala.  It was accompanied by less than 1/4  cup of garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.  The chicken cutlets were small and thin.  Half way through his meal he asked me if we had anything in the fridge at home because he was definitely still hungry.  He said it was the first time he ate a meal at the restaurant but was still hungry.  Needless to say,  I had to go home and whip something up.\nNo bread was served. At an italian restaurant?????  I think that they have to rethink the size of their portions if they want to start in business.  I would have difficulty going back because I would still have to come home and cook!  \nThe server was excellent by the way."
2,"At $.39 an ounce this is another pay as you go self serve yogurt shop to hit the valley. They have the usual suspects, tart, vanilla and also several different \""skinny\"" versions which are \""no sugar, which means they don't add any but does contain sugar, so beware. On my visit they were out of 'skinny blueberry.. rats!\n\nHad a cup of the skinny yogurt.. again the cups are huge much like Yogurtology so you can over indulged quite easily. I was ready this time and only took just a little bit. The topping bar look great though nothing to really set it apart from the other place with the exception of the fruit looking and tasting fresher. \n\nWhile there is no \""skinny\"" tart version, the vanilla was decent enough with only a slight weird chemical after taste."
4,"You can't go wrong at this place... the burger was great (best burger in town), the fries were delicious, the onion rings were ok... they even had PBR for $3.  Plus, there's always a good group of customers and staff inside... and the music selection is great."
1,"Everyone knows food in Vegas is ALWAYS over priced, but I always expect a certain type of quality as well... nothing over the top, just a little better than decent I guess you could say..\n\nThe food here were below my expectations.. \n\n- Pan fried noodles: they were doused in sauce and the noodles weren't even crunchy..\n- Chinese broccoli was dry and overcooked.. \n- Their duck with rice is more of an individual portion rather than a la carte which is what I had hoped for..there was more rice than duck, and the duck portions had mostly bones (although bones are a big part of duck, the bone portion here was more than normal).\n\nThe line here is a bit rediculous, and to be honest I'm not quite sure why.. food isnt that great and there are tons of other places open 24/7 in sin city!"
2,"The hubby and I stopped by around 8:30 at night. Upon pulling up, we seen that the line was almost out the door. Determined to get some ice cream, I insisted on going in and waiting in line. It took about 15 minutes to get our order, but the place was jam packed so the wait was to be expected.  All the employees were doing their best to keep the line down. I ordered the smallest size, \""like it\"", and the employee actually gave me the next size up at no charge because she said she grabbed too much ice cream. \n\nThere's very little seating at this location,  and the available tables were dirty. But to be fair,  if all hands were on deck making orders, whose left to clean up? We chose to get our order to-go. \n\nI'm a fan of Cold Stone's ice cream.  I'm accustomed to the long lines. But to me, it's worth waiting to get me some \""All lovin' no oven\""."
0,I've gone here a few times the food is just ok for the most part.  What I don't like is the upcharge they add on things and never tell you about until you look at your receipt--has happened twice to me.  If you charge extra for certain things let me know about it first.  \n\nAnother issue is the attitude that you get from the workers there.  Ummmm $10 for some crap that you call tacos and served with a side of attitude? I will NOT be returning.
4,"Growing up in an asian family, mum is always making pasta with soy sauce or something asian. \n\nThis place gives that a whole new meaning, using uniquely japanese ingredients with italian. \n\nWe ordered the uni(urchin) tomato pasta and the squid ink pasta. Both were nothing less than amazing! \n\nOften, pasta can get a little sickening and oily, but not the ones from here. \nThe urchin was creamy and fresh and works ridiculously well with a tomato based spaghetti. \nThe squid ink was strong and flavoursome with fresh seafood, loved it!\n\nMaybe I'm biased because I'm asian, but this place is like every asian mums pasta on steroids. Gonna have to up your game mum..."
2,"It's old.  It's tired.  The Embassy Suites here on North 44th hasn't changed much in the last several years.  But it's the only place we baseball fans prefer to stay.\n\nSure, we could stay at the Marriott and carouse with the baseball players, but it's too expensive over there and it's not our style.  The Embassy Suites has breakfast made to order in the morning, and free cocktails at night.  And a suite so that we can invite others to stay with us.  And the location is perfect:  10 minutes away from the airport, 10 minutes from two baseball fields (Phoenix Muni and Scottsdale), and two minutes from a major shopping center.\n\nAnd they finally got their internet to work.  \n\nSo I don't mind a few maintenance problems, no hair dryer in the bathroom, etc.  This'll do just fine."
2,"I came here during my stay in Scottsdale for work on a Sunday night. It happened to coincide with Spring Training so I was told that all the restaurants were much busier than usual. This is probably the reason that despite the many empty tables both inside and outside (they were all filled by the time I left), I was told there was only availability for one at the bar or area in front of the kitchen. I opted for the kitchen area and got to watch the cooks at work during my dinner. \n\nThe atmosphere is very chic, but the patrons were a eclectic mix of retirees, families and young partiers. The concept is Mediterranean, although I didn't see any traditionally Mediterranean dishes on the menu. The menu is pretty sizable with a variety of pasta, fish, and meats to select from, with vegetarian and gluten-free options marked.  \n\nFOOD:\nPROSCIUTTO CRUDO FLATBREAD (topped with rosemary potato and soft egg) - When I ordered this, I didn't realize the portion was supposed to be shared so it ended up being way too much for me. If I had just one slice, it would've been great, but it got tiring after my third slice.\n\nBIG EYE TUNA (with charred scallions, snap peas, couscous & miso caramel) - I'm a sucker for couscous! I always order it when I see it on the menu so this selection was a no-brainer. The couscous and the snap peas did not disappoint. The Ahi Tuna was sesame seed crusted and was fine, but not mind-blowing. I wish it were marinated more to give it extra flavor.\n \nThe reason I rated this as 3 stars is simply because while the food was good, nothing was that impressive, especially for the price. Maybe if I came back and tried a few more items and drinks I would change my mind, but for now, this is just an OK restaurant.\n\nI would still recommend this restaurants for groups because I think their outside patio area is lovely. The menu is also diverse and safe enough that everyone should be able to find something they enjoy. However, definitely make a reservation, otherwise you'll be stuck at the bar like me!"

1,"THIS IS FOR HAPPY HOUR ONLY...\n\nMcCormick's is a sold chian seafood restaurant.  I've dined here for full dinner several times and the food is typically well prepared, if unimaginative.\n\nHappy Hour runs Monday through Friday until 6:30pm with drink and food specials in the bar and front section of the restaurant.  We arrived at 6pm on a Fridayy night, and it was standing room only in the bar, but we were able to grab one of the \""happy hour\"" tables in the main dining room.  There are about a dozen items on the HH food menu, including a $2.95 half pound cheeseburger.  Prices range from $1.95 to $4.95.\n\nWe ordered fish tacos ($1.95 for 2), ceviche ($1.95), cheeseburger sliders ($4.95 for 3), sweet potato fries ($3.95), Ahi tostadas ($4.95), and steamed mussles ($2.95).  The fish tacos were two dry corn tortillas with one piece of blackened fish in each.  There was cabbage and tomato on the plate which we put on top.  They weren't terrible.  The ceviche has a thick tomato base and tasted more like ketchup than anything.  Mussels were stringy and chewy.  They looked dried out despite being cooked in a white wine broth.  The sliders were GREAT.  Soft rolls, grilled onions, cooked medium.  The Ahi Tostadas were also great; three peices of seared Ahi on fried wonton wrappers topped with purple cabbage and a sesame dressing.  Sweet potato friens are sweet potato fries.  They were hot, crispy and plentiful.\n\nThere were no liquor specials listed on the happy hour menu, only beer and wine specials.  I had a $5 champagne cocktail and hubby ordered a $4.50 beer.\n\nNext time, I think we'll stick with the things they seemed to do well, which are also the more expensive offerings.  The service was smooth and attentive.  The atmosphere is not high energy or exciting.  This is a place to eat and go, not to hang out and people watch or chat."
0,"More like Crapmine's Pizza.  This place can suck it.  I ordered a pizza for delivery and was told it would be 20-30 minutes.  After waiting patiently for over an hour, I gave them a call and was told the driver was 2 minutes away.  20 minutes later, I called them to complain.  After my 30 second rant, the scum on the other side of the phone was like, \""I'm sorry brah, what was that?\""  Psshh.  Whatevs."
1,"Worst experience ever.  We were here for two Saturdays (first Saturday about 11 people and 2nd Saturday 8 people) both times we did not get our food for almost 2 hours.  Our group was not the only one had the issue, we can see other parties complaining and yelling to the manager for the poor service,  but not all experience was bad though because the manager apologized for the issue, gave us a 100 dollar gift card and said our food are also free of charge.  I can't imagine how many parties they had to comp.\n\nThe food are good unfortunately the service are terrible when it comes to big parties.\n\nIt's not bad if you go on a small group but I would not recommend a party of more than 4 people, clearly they don't know how to handle large parties."
0,"I have been wanting to try City Tavern for a while now. I feel as if I should have tried them years ago. It almost seems as if the restaurant may be cutting corners. The food is subpar. Most of what I had was previously frozen. My egg roll was cold in the middle and the calamari was incredibly chewy. My \""sushi grade\"" tuna was pink, not red. It was basically over priced bar fare."
0,"MUST to avoid. Confusing system, indifferent service, sloooooow, bland food."
1,"I am giving this 2 stars because of the nightclub.  I probably would have given 3 or maybe even 4 for dinner. \n\nDinner: Obviously expensive.  We had reservations and still waited 20 minutes.  Maybe this is normal in Vegas but I thought it was crazy when they make you make the reservation, give your credit card number, and then call the day of to confirm. Hello, we are going to come.  My husband and I had the duck and really liked it.  They lure you in by saying you get a wristband for the club if you eat there, but don't tell you that you must purchase a $40-$50 entree to get that band. Service was mediocre.  In all, the food was satisfying. But go for the expensive food, not to get into the night club. \n\nNightclub: awful.  If 500 people left, it may have been fun.  You couldn't move, and not in a good way.  It was uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all.  The bartenders were rude.  It took minimum 20 minutes to get a drink.  The drinks were minimum $14. We left after 30 minutes (maximum).  Veryyyy disappointing."
4,"Pop Up Pizza is the shit. Now I did not get any pizza this review is for the chicken tenders and the service. I stayed at the Plaza this past week and found this little gem the last night we were there. Wish I would have found it earlier. I ordered the 20 piece chicken tenders for bf and I to share and was happily surprised at the price of about $18 with tax. We got them plain with buffalo and teriyaki sauce on the side. The man who was taking our order was super helpful and patient while we tried to decide what to order. Our order was ready in about 10 minutes and was fresh and hot. The tenders were a decent size and the sauces that accompanied them were good as well. The ranch is homemade and bomb.com. I am very picky about ranch and this one was up to par. We had lots of chicken leftover i just wish we had a damn refrigerator we could have put them in to eat the next day, but that was no fault of PUP. Im excited to go back and try their pizza."
4,"I don't really do the lounge scene back home due to one really bad experience a few years ago at Enclave. I wouldn't go as far as to call Enclave much of a lounge, but they all kind of seem the same to me. Until I met Bond. It was a \""one-thing-led to-another\"" relationship with Bond. *Blush!*\n\nI visited Bond about 3 times over the course of one week and even decided to stay at his place on my last night! Well, by his place, I really mean the Cosmopolitan. And it was with my husband for our final night in Vegas, so I guess it was kind of a threesome. Yeeah... about Bond.\n\nThe music is pumping, but not obnoxious. The DJ was great. The decor is excellent. The seats are comfy. The scene is full of variety, but not like a douche circus. I drinks? Don Johnson joined me a few times. The staff? Friendly and fabulous. I donned my glitzy best and can't wait to visit again on my next trip through town."
3,"My first experience with a firehouse sub wasn't so pleasant, so when this one popped up in the neighborhood, it took a while to go in and try it again.  What a surprise, it was actually good!\n\nI got the Turkey Bacon Ranch.  It has smoked turkey breast, bacon, and sharp cheddar cheese with peppercorn ranch to finish it off.  The bread was fresh, the turkey was moist and tender, and the bacon crisp.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  \n\nService is not bad, they make it when you order, serve it when it's ready, and you self serve your own drink, the place is clean and is more spread out than my first experience, so I didn't feel I was sitting someone else's lap.  With this experience, I will be glad to go back."
3,Had the super nachos and hard shell taco. Nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat.
0,"Summary: every dish, and I mean every dish tasted like it was under a heat lamp for 6 hours. I expected much more. They had a great selection of sushi, classic Chinese dishes, stir fry counter, and extensive seafood bar. It is a shame that all were so bland. I will not be back."
3,Love the service and smiles everytime we visit this store!
0,I've never waited in a drive thru so long. 2 People behind us got their order first. We orders 2 shakes and 12 wings. Wings were drenched in WAY too much sauce. When we finally got our wings we were given no ranch which we asked for when we ordered. Went in to talk to them manager looked like he was high on drugs. We were given our ranch and he said that the workers should have told us there was a long wait. Nothing was given to us and no sorrys were said. Will NEVER go there again.  TERRIBLE service.
3,"The owners of this fast-casual Asian diner on ASU's Downtown campus, brothers Jack and Ben Juang, put heart and soul into every family inspired creation and their passion comes through in every forkful (I only use chopsticks if I'm on a date or trying to eat slowly). \n\nI've been a huge fan since Hsin Cafe first opened its doors in the spring and will continue to champion their stellar menu, which includes fantastic chow mein, fried rice, curry and teryaki bowls, as well as signature entrees that showcase BBQ pork, beef, shrimp and chicken.\n\nMy current favorite is beef chow mein but I can honestly say that I've tried everything on the Hsin Cafe menu and not once have Ben and Jack disappointed. \n\nThe portions are large so it's entirely possible that you're spending $5-7 on two meals--perfect for students or any workaday Downtowner on a budget."
4,"Okay, so the griddle was such a fun and unique experience that even now as I'm thinking about it I have a HUGE smile on my face.  \n\nIf you can't tell already by the pictures, the portions here are enormous.  As in, bigger than your face enormous.  I got the Black Magic pancakes (oreo pancakes) and could barely get through 1/4 of the dish.  \n\nWasteful, yes.  Hilariously and entertaining, absolutely.  The pancakes were also AMAZING.  The service was VERY helpful as well.  \n\nHighly recommend coming here - it was my favorite breakfast place in Vegas by far."
1,"I have no complaints about the food, if you can actually get it.  I stopped going here because they keep messing up my order.  It's not like I have a complicated order, either, but when I want a bean and cheese,  I don't want a carne asada.  If I say no cheese, a burrito with cheese is not OK.  I once went here with two friends and they managed to screw up all three of our orders.  \n\nAlso, I went here with a lactose-intolerant friend and he asked them to clean the grill before making his food to avoid an allergic reaction.  They looked at him like he asked for space food.  We ended up going someplace else.\n\nThere's a Filiberto's up the street.  They've always managed to get my order right, so I don't bother with this place anymore."
2,"I'm not a gynecologist,  but I'll have a look.\n\nI don't know who that blonde wearing the blue thong was or where her daddy issues came from, but I finally figured out how I want to die when I grow up. I want that fucking blonde from last weekend to sit on my God damn pretty Asian face and suffocate me to death. That would be an amaaaazing way to go out. NOM NOM NOM. Eat her ass up like shrimp fried rice.  Her butthole smelled like Heaven.\n\nI'm not gonna lie. I like the Rhino much better than this place. I just feel like the set up and the slam pieces at the Rhino are of a much better caliber. A good portion of the slams at Sapphire look like Krusty the Klown. They're of a lesser quality, BUT every once in a while you will meet an incredible slam piece loaded with daddy issues and eating disorders (SUCH a turn on). So it's kind of like do I want a dance from Emmanuelle Chriqui at the Rhino or do I want a dance from Amy Whinehouse at Sapphire? Hmmm...\n\nAnyways, if you're at any of these strip clubs then I suggest getting bottle service. It's obv  the way to go. You're not walking around aimlessly and accidentally touching other dudes' boners. Instead, you're at a table with your boys passing slams around from lap to lap like you guys used to pass around the \""hot potato\"" back in first grade. When that slam piece of your dreams lands on your lap you take her to the back and show her your boner. DISCRETION: If you get kicked out then don't blame me, bro."
2,Looking for an upscale sexy pizza place with a DJ spinning some music for your date tonight? This is the place. The pizza is yummy and the atmosphere is great. DJ yes dancing No. Disclaimer: I don't recommend this place for large groups especially if you are super hungry.
0,"We came here for the Nachos, which many people seem to order and my friends had seen it and couldn't stop thinking about them. Well I have to say, what a disappointment!! We ordered the 4 cheese Nacho platter (we have a vegetarian in the group) and asked them to add black beans, which they charge extra for! The nachos come out with very little pico de gallo, and literally a sprinkle of black beans. The good thing was the waiter came out with a bowl of more black beans b/c he realized how very little we were given (so yes A for service). \n\nThe nachos were just not good. One of the 4 cheeses tasted like Velveeta. I think for this price the nachos need more substance such as jalapenos, onions, pico de gallo, salsa, beans... \n\nOh and another think this place has pretty bad smell in certain parts of the restaurant (poor sewage perhaps?)"
2,"We upgraded to the premier experience, but it wasn't really that exciting.  \n\nIt's true, the rooms are quite dark.  The bathrooms, however, are huge!  With two sinks, both of us had our own pampering and make up station.  The shower stall was large for a shower stall but I prefer a bathtub shower combination.  And they offer you 500 SPG points if you refuse room service.  I like the bathrobes and the 3 bottles of water free per night.  Except the crappy part is that if you refuse room service you don't get your water bottles or shampoo or lotion.  \n\nI do find it convenient that the Miracle Mile shops are right there.  The hotel is also conveniently located on the strip.  For that reason, I would totally stay here again.  \n\nThe casino is pretty stylish compared to the others on the strip.  They had a good amount of food places . My favorite this about this hotel was that the premier experience rooms had an iPod dock for an alarm clock and that made it so much more fun. \n\nBut for NYE's we were paying premium price and I would have expected a lot more benefits, than just a free bottle of alcohol."
3,"So, after hearing about Delux from co-workers and Yelp, I had to try it.\n\nGetting there early helps, because the restaurant gets packed quickly. \n\nFirst off, the place is ultra chic. A large bar/table is in the center of the restaurant, highlighted with blue lights. This place oozes of sleek.\n\nBut enough about the lighting, onto the food!\n\nI got the Delux burger, which was incredible. Medium rare beef, served up on arugula with gruyere and a mixture of onions and bacon was incredible. The bun, a super soft baguette style was incredible as well. \n\nJuice dripped from this burger. Not grease, but juice.  Pure, delicious, incredible, beef juice. If I could bottle and sell it, I would.\n\nMy fiance had the turkey burger, which was excellently spiced, a tad dry, but the aioli helped cover that dryness.\n\nTheir fries were also tasty, I enjoyed the ketchup and aioli. However, I have had better sweet potato fries.\n\nTheir beer selection is awesome, including selections from 4 Peaks, I had an excellent Kolsch-style lager, that complemented my burger well.\n\nThe prices are a little high, but the burger does make it worth it, both size and quality\n\nOn a final note,I wouldn't recommend coming here at night, it seems like over priced drinks, loud music, and lots of stuck up people."
0,"Ordered for delivery and it took over TWO HOURS to get the food, which was cold AND not what I ordered.  A trifecta of incompetence. Don't do business here."
4,"Sooooo good.\n\nWe went for my friend's birthday and everything was a delight.\n\nLet me start with our waiter, whose name I cannot remember. He was funny, patient, honest in his recommendations and took our table's dietary limitation into consideration (1 vegetarian and 3 vegans). At one point I dropped something on my white dress, a horrendous mistake on my part, and he brought me club soda so it wouldn't stain. What a peach, right?\n\nThe server's recommendation, the rain forest roll, was delicious. The fried tofu was delicious. The seaweed salad, delicious. The edemame, delicious and served with a slice of lemon. And the tea, whatever fancy tea it was, was lovely. \n\nI was stoked by how many vegan options they had and surprised by how kind the wait staff was."
4,"Pros: Taste of New York Sirloin (the Japanese Wagyu 2 oz. specifically), cool decor, really nice server named Carlos\nCons: None?\n\nI went here with Kristin C. for our 2 year anniversary dinner last week and I was definitely impressed. The decor was really nice in here.  It had a modern feel. The lights were dimmed which created a very relaxing and intimate setting. Perfect for a romantic dinner. We got a nice booth and a really attentive server named Carlos.\n\nDecor is nice and all, but we all know the food is really what matters.  After we ordered, another waiter came around with a platter of different breads. I got one wheat bread and one pretzel type bread. Apparently, the pretzel bread is their specialty. I could definitely see why. It was soft and delicious.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the \""A Tasting of New York Sirloin\"" ($140). It comes with different types of New York sirloin:\n\n- Japanese Wagyu From Saga Prefecture 2 Oz\n- American \""Kobe Style\"" From Snake River Farms 4 Oz\n- U.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Age From Nebraska 4 Oz\n\nAll 3 steaks were really tasty. Definitely, some of the best steaks I've had in my life. However, the best out of the 3 was definitely the Japanese Wagyu. So freaking good. It was nice and tender. My steak knife cut through it like butter. I can see why they only give 2 oz. too. Two reasons: 1) its the pricest per ounce and 2) I think since it's sooo rich and tender, if you get too much, it might be too much of a good thing.\n\nWe also got potato puree and mushrooms as sides and they were good too. But seriously, the steaks made my night.  Hanging out with Kristin C. was cool too I guess :)\n\nOverall, this place is great for special occasions. I might just have to go to CUT in LA just to get my Japanese Wagyu fix."
2,just get the coconut margarita! \n\ntaco bell is better in respect to the food and service quality
2,"Another average-to-poor experience at Regal Stonecrest.  I went to the theater on a busy Sunday afternoon (this theater is ALWAYS busy because of its size and location).  There was ONE person working at the ticket counter...for the theater with 20+ screens.  Seriously?  Can they not afford to pay someone minimum wage to work on weekends, the BUSIEST times for movie-going?   It also didn't help that the young girl behind the counter was flirting with the teenage boys at the front of the line for 5 minutes.  \n\nOnce I was finally inside, I'm always disappointed at the grungy appearance of the lobby, hallways, and bathrooms.  This place is in need of a serious makeover.  I look forward to the lights going down in the theater so I don't have to look at anything but the movie screen."
2,"Basically you get what you pay for with this theater. Ticket prices are discounted ($6 for a Sunday 4pm showing) compared to newer theaters.  This place is older and definitely has some wear and tear.  There was only one person working the concession stand. The theater itself has old seats and no stadium seating. If you're on a budget but want to see new releases at a discounted price this is the theater for you. Next time, however,  I'd rather pay the little extra for a nicer, newer theater."
4,"With a rich atmosphere, pleasant wait staff, and food to die for, this restaurant is truly something special\n\nMy wife and I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade, Stuffed Mushrooms, Chicken Bellagio, and Mahi Mahi Mediterranean. \n\nEvery morsel of what we ate was divine.\n\nI highly recommend the mushrooms, and trying the Bellagio put my mouth in food Heaven.\n\nTiana C was extremely pleasant waiting on us, and other than maybe prices being a \""smidge\"" high, and I do mean just a smidge, there's nothing I would change about Cheesecake Factory"
0,Worst McDonald's by far. It always smells like sewage and the food is alway old. When you tell someone about it's like an inconvenience to them. I can't believe the manager is actually the manager. She has the personality of a rock. There are only a small amount of great employees here.
2,"Ok. \n\nSo this place is NEVER busy! and its open real late.\nSo already I like it because its open late, however the food well the food is alright.\n\nThe meat that they use have too much fat, especially the slices of beef, however for the price its a good deal.\n\nThe service is pretty good, and they pay attention to you, mostly because its never busy, or at least its never been busy when I go there, which is quite late most of the time..\n\nSo if its late, everything is closed, use this as a plan B most definitely. However it is a good plan B"
1,"I'd love to give these guys a better review, because they were very friendly and professional.  However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.\n\nHere are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.\n\nOn to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!\n\nWhen you advertise on your website \""showroom quality,\"" I expect showroom quality.  Overall review: good job on the exterior, attention to detail in the interior was very poor.  I am really dissapointed that the attention to detail just wasn't there.  I was expecting so much more from a detail job."
3,"This is a hill with a view. On a clear day you will be able to see all over the Edinburgh-land and beyond. You can imagine being transported in time looking at the observatory and the columns of the unfinished monument. \n\nIn the summer you will have unobstructed sunshine on the days that the sun is out. And if you are into your photography the sunrises and sunsets from this heightened view point are ah-mazing. \n\nThe Carlton Hill is used as a venue for many art and performances - most famous is the Beltane Festival on 30 April. (the Winter spring Equinox)\n\nOn New Year's Eve / Hogmany this is one of the 7 hills that will display fireworks. \n\nhopefully they will not change this hill and its access, as it is a blessing for the residents as not many tourists tend to venture up this hill - since there is loads of other stuff for them to do.\n\nI like it here and it is mostly a very nice place to have a quiet walk and be out of the busy City that is just meters away."
2,"Finally found this place. Loved the samples and the service was ok.....a little Snooty. We bought the Bacon Carmel Toffee and a couple Flying Pigs. Honestly, it was just ok and just a hint....tiny hint of the bacon flavor at the end. More of an Overpriced Vegas novelty Chocolate. They don't give samples of the Bacon Flavored items b/c it is their biggest seller. I think because people just want to try it. We prefer the Bald Man Chocolates upstairs."
3,"My 1st time here. \n\nWe popped in for lunch and some sun on the patio. I can see why the place is so popular, they have a really chill relaxed vibe here - that is IF you can get a parking space. The food was decent for pub grub, but nothing too remarkable. I imagine it's best in the evening with drinks and some pals.\n\nI'll be back for happy hour soon."
0,"If I could give no stars I would. This is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. Their billing is so messed up. I am supposed to be price locked (meaning I signed a 2 year agreement with them for $120/month) in with them and every couple of months I get a bill that is $30 to $40 higher. I have to call them and argue with them about them. It's ridiculous.\nJust recently I moved and when I called to transfer the services I asked the CSR if there were going to be any fees associated with the transfer and she assured me there would not be. When the guy came to install it again I asked him \""this gonna cost me anything?\"" again the answer was no. Just got my bill and guess how much.... $266!! $146+ more than it's supposed to be. $120 INSTALLATION FEES. Oh and now my monthly charges went up from $120 to $157/month. Im livid. I hate this company with a passion and cannot wait for this damn contract to be up! And of course, no 24 hour customer service."
3,"I eat here embarassingly often. I'm talking 5-10x a year or more ! .. I'd like to say I'm drunk everytime I eat here, but like Veronica I eat here sober as well! I haven't gotten food poisoning from Taco Bell and they haven't screwed up my order very many times either. I always do the drive through, but so far so good ! The Beefy Cheesy Burrito for .99 with the rice and sour cream they are serving right now is my kryptonite. Damn you Taco Bell and your cheap crave-worthy eats."
0,"I had an appointment scheduled for a massage today at 3 pm. After driving there, the receptionist (who happened to be the owner) informed me that they accidentally put me down for a facial, and they didn't even have a massage therapist there on Wednesdays. The receptionist who I spoke with on the phone to book the massage was standing right next to her and didn't even apologize or take responsibility for her mistake. The owner was very rude, abrupt and cold, and offered nothing to make it right. I showed her a text message and email confirmation they sent me confirming the massage, and expressed that I drove all the way there for nothing. The owner did nothing to make it right. She asked if I wanted to PAY for a hair cut or facial instead! Why would I want to PAY for a haircut or facial??? I have never experienced such horrible customer service before. I was looking forward to my massage there and planning on signing up for a monthly membership. Very disappointed."
4,"This arena is fun! Outside area reminds me of downtown Disney with all the music, people and food. Inside is clean but they need to lower the AC a little bit during the hockey game. It was too cold even for my male family members."
0,Nasty. I'd rather spend a little more for better quality food. This is one step up from Applebee's.
4,"A phenomenal hidden gem near the Las Vegas Strip! My husband and I recently moved from the Bay area where we had a variety of vegan restaurant options. Moving to Vegas was disheartening because the dining choices are not as vegan friend as we used to. When a group of friends visited from Cali, they were considered enough to offer going to a vegan restaurant. From the group of 6, I was the only vegan, my friend was a pescatarian and the rest of the group were omnivores/carnivores. \n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes and a total of four soups, which were initially brought out. One soup was better than the other and I was continually amazed at the phenomenal taste and authentic flavors of each soup. My friends were equally delighted. As the dishes came out, everybody was amazed how \""real\"" the food tasted. In fact, one of them apparently did not even realize he was eating imitation meat! He just thought that the restaurant was vegan friendly but that they had meat options. This is a guy who eats meat for every meal!\n\nAfter hearing  everyone's very positive feedback, a few days later I invited another visitor friend of mine to try their dining experience. She absolutely loved it as well. \n\nAfter the first visit to say the least, I've gone back a lot more. Each time, the atmosphere has been very relaxing and zen; the staff very approachable and extremely friendly; the food has been consistently delicious!!\n\nOverall, this place is definitely my new go-to place for everything- whether it'd be to treat a cold, take our guests, or just have a great time. (When I feel a bit under the weather or get a cold, their soups are a must. I completely recover the day after!)\n\nIf you're a local, whether vegan or not, this place is a must to check out! If you've visiting, they're very close to the strip so be sure to visit for a very relaxing and delicious experience. \n\nNOTE FOR THE VEGANS: If you are Vegan, make sure to let the staff know. I was told that some of their foods may contain eggs- but nothing more. Make sure to ask and they'll let you know the dishes that are off limits."
1,"I have amended my review and added a star, I believe in being fair and honest in every situation. The manager did contact me the very night after reading my review. Although not my intention with the poor review, my money was refunded. The extra star is not for the refund but for the extremely fast response from the manager. So I retract my statement about them no caring they do. I wish them luck in the future and hopefully they can get the kinks worked out. \n\nWe're always excited to see new, independently owned places on the West Side but once again we were disappointed. After seeing such rave reviews we were happy to find this place. After eating here I'm suspicious that the reviewers who gave this place 5 stars may have some affiliation with the owners or staff. When we walked in, there were a few occupied tables and everyone working there greeted us and one guy suggested we sit on the patio. We did and it was nice out there but then it took quite a long time for anyone to come out. When someone finally did he said he was going to get our drink order and then get us some menus. Weird order of events in my opinion. We had to wait until we got our drinks to even start deciding what we wanted to eat? The Hub's ordered an iced tea and I ordered a margarita with no salt. Our drinks and menus came out, mine with salt and when the Hub's asked for sweet n low the waitress said they didn't have any but offered sugar. Huh?! Ok, a little bizarre that they didn't have some sort of artificial sweetener but no big deal... until she returned with sugar on a paper plate. They apparently have iced tea but no sweeteners to offer with it. My margarita tasted like store bought mix and came out in a beer pint glass. Our food came out fast and it was ok until my husband got to the end of his French fries and there were curly black hairs in them. I have long blonde hair and my husband has auburn so they for sure weren't ours. I had to go in and give my credit card to the bartender to pay and when the waitress came back out with my receipt I showed her the hairs. She did offer to take the dish off of our ticket but I refused. He had eaten almost the whole thing so I didn't think that was fair. I heard her go in and summon the manager to show her the hairs but no one came back out to apologize so obviously they didn't care. I guess we'll continue to go to Phoenix or Scottsdale to get a decent meal. That's a shame."
3,First time in Vegas and I stayed here. Decent room loved the set up of the gambling floor. Awesome restaurants and friendly staff. I would come here again.
2,"You's aiight.\n\nIf you're looking for something really low key in Vegas, this place will suffice.\n\nOf course drinks are still expensive as F, but it is still Vegas after all.\n\nKind of awkward because you have bottle service, a tiny ass dance floor with most of the people just standing around awkwardly staring at the dance floor wondering, \""what do I do now?\""\n\nIn order: pre-party in the room, have A drink (yes, just one) in the lounge and then peace the heck out of there for something way more fun."
0,Regarding their Custom Framing.  I can't believe it took them 2 full weeks to finish framing my picture.  Either they have alot of work or they work slowly.
2,"This place is open 24 hours so that alone gets it at least half a star. I have had the cheesesteak (with provolone) twice from there now and both times it was dryer than Nancy Reagan's CENSORED ;) ... Their fries are freshly handcut and quite delicious. It is kind of expensive though, fries and soda and a cheesesteak was $15! Not much else in the area that I have found to compare it to so I will probably continue to eat there every once in a while. Overall I give it a \""Its 330 am and its better than a fast food chain so what the hell!\"""
0,"I've had good meals and service here in the past on annual trips to Vegas, but not this time. Drinks sat empty waiting for refills, the server walked away without mixing the sauce for lettuce wraps and didn't return til we'd given up and attempted to mix our own. The salad was inedible, the meal wasn't much better. Undercooked rice, no flavor. No sign of our server for at least 15 minutes while we waited for our check. It was lunchtime on a weekday, not very busy. We went here as part of a long standing family tradition, but won't waste another Vegas meal \""time slot\"" on this place. Try Kung Fu at the other end of town."
1,Get the pro desk some help.  I wasted 2 hours of my life yesterday and six hours of one of my workers who I had to pay.  My best guess is there just understaffed but it doesn't seem like they know what's going on over there. Either way it just translates into problems for me.  It'll be awhile before I try to call over to their pro desk again.
2,"Not terrible, not great. May be better to call ahead.....we ended up waiting a while and then they had 3 workers working on 6 people. They were doing their best but understaffed and too many customers. Their service probably also suffered a little bit because of it. Might not have been a good day for them..."
0,"Rip off 2.79 with car wash otherwise 3.09 what a rip.\nGas down the street is only 2.79 without the car wash , ice.   Drive further it's worth it."
0,"the Front desk staff was very pleasant, Hotel is old, the kitchen appliances is very old, we booked four rooms four nights. each one w/ old appliances. Housekeeping didn't refurnish daily supply, wouldn't stay here ever again"
0,"Incompetent and unprofessional.  I took my car in because it developed a miss, the kind typical of something wrong with the ignition system.  I specifically asked if they did computer diagnostics and they assured me they did.  They called me later with the results - said it needed the carburetor rebuilt for around $400.  I went over to pick up the car and decide what to do.  I asked to see a printout of the computer diagnostic so i could see if the ignition system had checked out OK.  He didn't have a printout.  When I asked more about their \""computer system\"" his answers got really weaselly.  I paid them the Diagnostic fee.  I didn't believe them and took the care to a different shop that I like but that was much farther away to have them check it.  They checked and said the problem was a bad spark plug that was all fouled and showed me the plug, it was a mess.  They had put in a new plug to replace it and they car ran fine.  They said it would probably foul it again because the valve stem seals were leaking.  They also said there was nothing wrong with the carburetor and the car ran great when I drove away.   I went back to the Shell station with the results and asked to speak to the owner.  Supposedly he wasn't there.  I came back later and the same guy was there and I finally pinned him down to at least admit he was in charge and showed him the results from the second shop and explained that with the 1 new $2 plug the problem was fixed.  Asked him how such a clearly bad plug, which I showed him, would not have literally jumped off the computer screen of his \""computer diagnostics\"".  He just try to BS his way around without answering.  I told him I thought they owed me my money back for their \""diagnosis\"" since it was so clearly wrong.  He refused to even consider it.    I wouldn't trust this place to wash my windows much less do any work on my car."
1,"The Blake is like an old pair of shoes inside a new shoe box.\n\nThe paint is new. The carpet is new. The elevators are old. The phone in my room didn't work. The ice is on 3 floors of 16. The furniture is new and cool looking, if rather cheap. There is a flat screen TV. But it doesn't get any channels. There is a wifi signal but I can't seem to connect to it. There is an iPod dock, thank gawd. \n\nI will say this: it is a hotel. Not awful. But avoid it if you can."
0,"So we were \""upgraded\"" by our timeshare, to stay here. First off, this is not a upgrade. I've stayed in better motels than this. The rooms are outdated, dirty, small, smelly and noisy. There's no fridge in the room, they had to bring one up for us. The place is confusing as all hell to navigate with all the construction going on.\nThe staff was nice, that's the upside.\n\nThe one really upsetting point was when we checked in, we requested a 2 bed non smoking. There was ONE available, and it wasn't ready. It just so happened to be above a live band that plays until 3 am. Well that's horrible, especially when you have a 2year old. The only other 2 beds were smoking. So imagine if we came 30 mins later to check in. We would have no options for a 2 bed. Lovely. Awesome.\n\nThanks Quad. For the shitty welcome."
1,"My husband had the new 5-cheese Mac and Cheese with chicken. Looked pretty good and he said it was tasty.\n\nI however had the tried-and-true baby back ribs. Awful! Very dry to the point the meat was very cooked down and the ends were all but burned. They didn't even try to cover it up with globs of bbq sauce, which is a common stunt. Very BLEH... Won't ever get the ribs there again and highly dis-recommend them from others. Ew."
3,"Cute Cute Cute! I really like this little place! I'm a big fan of wine bars that are small and unpretentious. I attended the UYE organized by Trish and I was so happy I did! For dinner, I ordered the Caprese Panini that boasted a LARGE tomato, basil, and mozzarella. I asked to add prosciutto and they were very happy to oblige. Each and every person that I spoke to on the staff was friendly and conversational. I really like that. I will certainly visit Centro again! I would love to try some of their other paninis!"
0,Came here today. Got seated by the host and never got service! After about 20 mins of servers walking by and others being served that came in after we did we decided to leave.. Maybe we smelled bad???  but still gonna give it 1 star for being seated
1,"This Starbucks is owned by Treasure Island and not corporate-owned, so they do not have perks like receiving stars or free modifiers using the Starbucks card. They can take your card number off the mobile phone app though. I only went here every morning because of its convenience. It was real Starbucks (not just proudly brewing).\n\nI found the employees here friendly enough, but nothing more than absolutely necessary. There are no tables and chairs, so don't plan on sticking around. Get your coffee and move on. It's now the only Starbucks ON the street in this area of the strip. Just don't think you're going to have a religious experience with your morning cuppa joe."
4,"This place was amazing, best AYCE in town! The customer service was very good and they had the cutest lil Asian waitress working haha. The Sex Bomb roll was delicious and so were every other roll we ordered!  Definitely coming back soon!"
2,"The coffee was very good but the service wasn't the best. The gal and only employee wasn't very friendly or personable. The tables are a little rickety and close together. They do have free wifi, so that was awesome. It was a nice day so they had garage door-style windows open. Very cool. I'd return but would hope it was a bit more inviting in terms of service."
3,"Red velvet pancakes are the bomb, fluffy soft, not too sweet.  They made eggs well with crispy edges.  Large portions.  Unfortunately,  no specialty coffees.  Kinda out of the way to travel and neighborhood a little iffy. Food delicious,  very Hawaiian with spam options."
0,"I wrote a review on the venition when I was staying there, but I should have posted one on here. My wife and I were at the venition for a weekend and decided to go to the covention they were having. I was walking threw the outside to threw the parking garage and some big guy wearing a red ses shirt and a silver name tag was sitting outside by the garage, ( an obvious sands employee ) hit on my wife, very disrespectful. He looked high on something and the garage smelled horrible of pot. I think for such a high end place they would maybe drug test or background check there employees, I own a bussiness and I would never ever! Let my employees do such a thing. His name was john v or john n. I I didnt want my anger to get the best of me so we left and never to return. I understand  some drunk guy wondering the strip but not an employee. I will never recommend my company to hold a booth there nor will I return to the venition."
3,"Pretty decent restaurant, just not as amazing as I was expecting. \n\nWent here on a date with my husband and we both agree it's not a great date spot unless you don't like to talk to your significant other. It was far too loud for any sort of conversation and the tables were so close together you could hear what everyone around you was discussing. \n\nOn the flip side, the food was very nice. We had the Caesar Salad, Salmon Hot & Cold (scrumptious), Duck Two Ways, Filet & Short Ribs, and the apple and baklava desserts. Everything came out gorgeously plated, though we found the portions to be a little small. \n\nThe salmon app was cooked to perfection, as was my duck breast. The husband insists his short ribs could have been cooked more, but I had some and they were pretty tasty. \n\nOne random side-note: there was a medley of delicious but unidentifiable roasted root veggies on my plate and one of them (the orange-ish one) I hated violently. It tasted like sour dirt. I am confident it's a personal preference, but I'd love to know what it was so I can avoid it in the future. I don't think it was the turnips.\n\nBack to the food: dessert was also very tasty, if a bit small-portioned. And, as an added bonus, Spoon has a great specialty cocktail list. I had the Vancouver in a Glass, which was wonderfully scotch-y and weirdly effervescent. In my opinion, an imaginative specialty cocktail menu gives a restaurant serious bonus points. \n\nIt's also worth noting that they had a very extensive wine menu.\n\nThe service was not bad, not awesome either though. I'm still not sure who my server was, which made it that much harder to tip. At least three people came to the table more than once, and we were a little over-waited on.\n\nOverall, I'll be back, but preferably with a group"
4,"This place is AMAZING. My friends and I had the best meal we've ever eaten, here. We received great service, as well, including a table visit from the Executive Chef. This is, by far, the best steak place we've ever eaten.  If you go to Vegas, do NOT miss this place."
1,"The only reason I gave them two stars was because of the pastrami. The guy takes the dirty rag and wipes the meat slicer and every thing on the counter. My wife got sick, it wasn't hot enough and they put cold pastrami with the plastic still on with the hot! I the L.A. area if you get caught using the dirty wipe down rag where food goes you get a C rating. My roast beef was good though and the hotel was great."
1,The food ain't what it used to be here. They've introduced a carvery but only one visit per person.
4,"I walked here from the strip because I thought it would be an adventure, and it was!  \n\nGot to see some cool, and at times, strange live music\n\nAlso got to see the last band of the night get kicked out of the establishment\n\nStickers everywhere!"
2,"So... If I had published this review right after check in it would have been rated negative infinity stars... Long day and poor attention to detail in taking my reservation led to missed details and a horrendously misspelled name...\n\nOnce we got all that figured out and the correct room we still had to get someone to come up to fix the TV. Fortunately room service (4 beers) was quick and friendly and about 10 minutes later I was in a far more agreeable mood. \n\nLesson learned: should have written down the confirmation number. \n\nWhatever... Can't sweat the small stuff for long. The room was awesome (especially considering the price). They call it a \""Superior\"" room but its really just a nice room with a big bed, nice bathroom, free breakfast, free pop...!!! Seriously superior!\n\nThe staff were also very accommodating given my less than charitable attitude in dealing with the check-in delays. Not saying  that I was a complete ass but I was a bit testy. As I've pointed out in countless reviews: great service goes a long way.\n\nThe superior room came with buffet breakfast (tasty) and a free mini fridge (no booze but lots of pop, Perrier and water). The bed was huge and comfortable and the bathroom (shower but no tub) was good.\n\nThis hotel greatly exceeded my expectations (especially for the price) and I'll be back. Hopefully check in will work out better the next time so that I can bump up my stars."
1,"I loved Postino's. Loved, as in past tense. Living in the area for the last several years, Postino's was my go-to place for everything from Saturday night celebrations to making a Monday just a little special. The wine is great, the menu is perfect, the ambiance is downright delightful. It's the staff that makes me cringe. On a recent visit, the snobby hostess told us the wait was 2 hours... But no one was there ... And there were empty tables ... Something did not seem right and when I asked her about it again, she rudely just stared at me. 2 hours later, we got seated and ignored. It took another hour (!) for our bruschetta to arrive to our table. We left feeling hungry  and  neglected. The worst part is that I started to ask around and I have three (3) other friends with almost the exact same experience. After so many happy years at Postino's, I won't go back to the Arcadia location. On the bright side, the Central location boasts the same menu minus the horrid staff."
3,"So glad we popped into here while taking a walk. I have been on a quest for quite awhile to find a place with Green Tea frozen yogurt and this place had it! It was a bit more tangy than expected, but I did enjoy it. The flavors here were more on the unique side versus the standard boring ones every other yogurt place has...of course they change the flavors, but t I hope they keep green tea on their rotating list.\n\nIt was definitely more of a college student hangout due to its location and time that we went (it was at night). It was clean, brightly light with nice energy.\n\nLook forward to returning when I am back there."
4,Fantastic pizza. Great to have them in town making authentic thin crust pizza. Tried four kinds all great.\nWithout a doubt the best pizza in town. Crust was cracker thin! Spectacular.
1,"I was dragged here once by my 57 year old auntie who was looking to pull. I think that sums it up! Jools Holland owns it- which gives it some credit I suppose, and it's nicely decorated inside but it's not my cup of tea. It seemed to be a playground for the over 50s looking to re-live their youth. It reminded me of dad dancing at a wedding - you know the sort. On several occasions, sweaty old men made their move towards me, at which point I hastily circled the room.\nFood-wise, it wasn't anything special either. I had pan-fried chicken without realizing it doesn't come with anything else, should have ordered sides. Yeah it was ok, and the price wasn't too bad, but nothing worth going out my way for."
2,Mid day and weekday so I was t the only one in the store.  The young man who worked there knew what I was looking for and helped me find it then I mentioned protein bars and he said most people really like the quest bars... and I remember reading quite a few reviews online for another place where people were looking for them at a better price.  Lots of flavors (I get so sick of chocolate protein bars/drink) and on sale so I bought a dozen.  I hope they are as good as everyone says!!!
4,"I agree with Jacquie H. But as opposed to cloning on doc there are a good many docs they could clone at this hospital. Dr. Gus has put together one of the most impressive veterinary teams with a broad scope of skills and expertise that I have ever experienced. Dr. Koch is responsible for Saving my very small poodle who was severely injured by someone who abused her. Not only did he save her but he along with his staff supported us over a year long process to bring the abuser to justice, providing letters to the court, copies of medical documents on several occasions. The actions of every staff member in this hospital were not only a display of impeccable professionalism and care of the highest quality but a display of their true commitment to caring for animals. The patients that go to this clinic receive the best care possible and I suspect are cared for as well if not better than human patients in some clinics. \n\nI am committed 100% to this hospital as a result of their support and passion for veterinary care for animals. They are also committed to making sure that owners are educated and informed in caring for their pets. They present all treatment options to owners ranging from conservative in non urgent cases to aggressive care with a concise consultation on risk associated with each. This allows owner to make informed decisions. Physicians are supportive of pet owners and will weigh in on the decisions providing substantive and qualitative reasoning for their recommendations. \nAnother note to concerned pet owners in these difficult financial times is that when these vets present care options they do take into consideration conservative measures for non urgent situations and are very conscious of guarding against unnecessary test or diagnostics if they are not needed. This said if they highly recommend testing or diagnostics it is  generally to confirm that aggressive or costly treatments are actually needed and these test may in fact save money in the long run. They will also recommend test if the symptoms of the problem are too broad to narrow down what is truly wrong with an animal. \n\nGreat Medical team at this hospital , I could not ask for more."
0,This is probaly the worst hotel on the strip got to our hotel after a six hour drive had to wait like an hour and a half to get ourmrooms we get into our rooms theres a horrible odor like sex come to find out the room wasnt clean at all there was spit in the ice cup cum on the bed mold on the bathroom floor i wouldnt recommend staying there but gambling there is fun most of the dealers are celebrity impersanators
1,"Some Auto Spa. Staff was friendly, place was clean and convenient for if you had to wait. \nI came here to get my car detailed. That wasn't really the case. They forgot to clean places like the rear view mirrors, the board behind the back passenger seats, the trunk. I ended up having to clean those myself. I have leather seats and I needed them to be conditioned. They don't seem to be conditioned. They actually look as of they were greased down. The back seats still look oily. They conditioned my dashboard for some reason even though it wasn't leather so at the moment it looks super greasy. At first I thought it would take some time to go away. But it's actually been a week and it still looks bad. I'm very disappointed and will never be here again. Way to impress a first time customer Cobblestone!"
1,"Really? This place is such a dated, throwback to 2003. The food is dated, the decor is dated- red and white pleather? They keep the lights really low so you can't see how dingy everything is.  The waiter kept bragging about all the celeb couples who have been there- Brad and Jennifer, JLO and Ben Affleck- and I'm thinking \""how long ago was that?\""  Is that the last time this place was \""cool'?  This is NOT fine dining.  Guy Savoy is fine dining.  Joel Robuchon is fine dining. Just sayin'..."
0,the food is really great good drinks  but terrible atmosphere the music so loud the waiters cant even hear you i work in clubs and their music is alot overpowering than anywhere ive been not good i understand the loungy feeling they want to put out but not to the point its uncomfortable i had their foie gras french toast which was amazing and i think i tried mac and cheese too i ended up leaving and sitting outside and had my meal packed to go i couldnt take the music and i got a migraine. they could do better. the food is amazing but i would never come here again for the sole purpose of the environment. we did ask the waiter if they could lower it a tad bit but if they did it was highly unnoticeable
4,"Classy classic, in a row of chains.  In Pittsburgh for a conference with many meals at Sheraton Station Square Hotel.  At end of conference, just wanted to relax in a nice setting. Was so disappointed on first night when I grabbed a meal at the Melting Pot. Tiny portions there and the chain mentality of the servers saying their rehearsed lines. Used Yelp to find Gandy Dancer for last eve and very satisfied.  Sat at bar with nice service from two bartenders. Had a recommended \""kettle\"" meal, jumbalaya with first course house salad, a really nice salad.  Both portions large and beautifully presented."
4,For a chain this (flamingo ave) Ruths chris is in my top ten of all times!\nOpen till 3am awesome wine great steak and service. I have been to four RC's and I think this is the best.
4,"Love this place!  Delicious food, great service, good music!   Great job Zappones!  Way to go Gilbert!"
3,"We stayed for  free for a 3 day weekend and pretty much stayed in the hotel experiencing everything it had to offer. Rather than try to capture the whole hotel in a line, I'll try to break it out:\n\nRooms (4): As many have said, it's just a Venetian room in brown color tones. I'm kind of jaded as I've stayed in many 4/5 star rooms in Vegas (mandalay, venetian, caesars,etc) so I didn't find that this one was all that exciting or spectacular. It was however very nice and on par with a 5 star hotel.\n\nRestaurants/Shopping (5): Incredible, tons of great restaurants and lots of great shopping. Shops are open until 11! however, not any good casual options.\n\nPool (3): Ok so as a word of warning.. the pool at palazzo doesn't get sun until 1 PM!!! Ok so you're thinking you might be sleeping till 1 Pm anyways, but good luck getting a chair at that point without paying the pool guys a fat tip. Also, no food served pool side! You have to get up and get your food (I'm a prima donna, I know) and the food isn't that good and WAY overpriced. Also drink service was lacking.. I should have moved over to the Venetian side I guess?\n\nNightlife Gaming (3): High limits ($15) for craps.. no surprise there. Lavo was just ok, but I'd like to explore the jazz bar next time. 40/40 sucks. I did however enjoy the happy hour at the cheesy \""del toro\"" in the basement. $6 drinks ,  I guess that's cheap? At least it had a nice strip view. Oh the sportsbook sucks too.. it's just a window near 40/40. boo\n\nEase of navigation (5): So this is important to me in Vegas.  I hate walking 30 minutes to my room, or having trouble finding craps,  restaurants, etc. This place is EASY. 1 tower of elevators, everything is well situated. Pool right off the elevators. That aspect is very nice.\n\nOverall a great place to stay, but with so many other great places to stay in Vegas I'd save this one for when you get a great offer in the mail. I would especially recommend this place for foodies due to all the yummy restaurants and how easy it is to pass out in your room after a nice meal !"
1,"I have to say that I was not a big fan of this place, however I would go back and try and savory frybread dish. \n\nI had just a simpl frybread with honey. I was not a fan, that the minute they pulled the frybread out of the fryer they added the honey. It made it a conbination of hot as hell and watery because it was hot. Because it was hot and watery, all the honey ran to the dipped spots of the bread, so most of my frybread didn't have anything on it was was plain. The taste of the frybread was not a awesome either. It was kind of bland and thin so it was a little dry. I expected the bread to be thick and moist. Like I said I would go back and have a savory diswh to see if I am any more impressed."
0,"My poor children who live out of state, have no idea how cheap and ugly the flowers I just received from Carmel Florist are. They do not resemble the online photo at all. I actually laughed at the gentleman who delivered them to my door. They spent $60 and they are not even worth $6. Shame on you for calling yourself a florist! I took photos just to prove what was delivered."
3,"I was so happy to see that Macy's has a small Lush tucked away in it's cosmectics department! I've only been to Lush in San Francisco and absolutely love their products but refuse to order online and pay more for shipping than the products. Their stuff is hand made from mostly organic ingredients and they use little or no preservative. I've been nothing but happy with their stuff and found some new goodies this time around like lip scrub and solid perfume. Employees at this location were super friendly and knowledgeable, good thing I don't live in Pittsburgh because a good chunk of my paycheck would be spent at Lush."
0,"NEVER GO HERE!! \nI started going here the first time I went it was very pleasant, this second and last time i went was a total disappointment, the so called \""owner\"" is very rude, inappropriate and very unprofessional!! The person who did my nails was hrs worst ever!! She would push my hands very aggressively and made me bleed!! They're unappreciative and say very bad things about the costumers!! I find it extremely unprofessional to act this way even your an owner, I feel like she needs to learn what the meaning of costumer service is! Don't waste your time going herd because the wait is usually about one hour and the service is the worst!! I completely discourage anyone from going here because you won't be treated with respect!!"
2,"This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\n\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot."
2,"Was here and staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Range masters were polite. My only disappointment  was that I figured I'd rent a revolver while I was there and the cashier finally talked me into the S&W Governor.  You boys that know, know what I'm talking about....let's shoot shotguns shells from a hangun!!!\nBut then after all the hype, they were out of shells.  Sad Face."
3,"Been there many times and have not been disappointed by the BBQ. Only been open for a short time but has won many awards and \""best of\"" contests. Travel Channel has already spotlighted them! Be prepared to wait in line. The quickest I have made it through getting my food is about 40 minutes. Despite the wait, it is still a 5 star join."
0,"I bought one of those sticker cards where you get the several oil change coupons for a low price. Seemed like a good deal considering how expensive oil changes can be these days.\n\nMy car was brand new. It had barely been off the lot a couple months. I brought it here for its first oil change after 3000 miles. \n\nThese guys had the audacity to tell me that I needed to change my front and rear brake pads. I'm a grown man, and another grown man looked me in the eye and told me a car with less than 4000 miles on it needed front and rear brake pads. \n\nMy trusted mechanic that I have used for several years confirmed the front pads had 75% remaining, and the rear had more than 80% remaining.\n\nI didn't bother using the remaining oil change coupons. \n\nIf you enjoy being lied to, and you like unnecessary up-sells, this is your mechanic!"
0,Service sucked !13$ soggy so also sucked. Sad I was looking forward to this place wonder why people rave about it. Stick to in and out...and they charge 20% tip so I guess service doesn't matter...
4,"I just love Reynas!  Their tortillas are so amazing. Margaritas: to die for!  We had shrimp enchiladas, fish tacos and chile rellenos.   All great!  My only diss was that I was to wussy for their chipotle salsa, and that's on me, not them. I'll adjust my palate to live up to it. They give the consumer a choice of 6 different salsas. (We sampled the tomatillo and the aforementioned chipotle. ). Love the Reynas!"
0,"please dont go!!!  Most likely the puppies there are under weight. I purchased a black German Shepard puppy for $900. She was on sale, beacuse she was to big for the box she was in. She was very skinny, I felt bad and brought her home. I took her to THERE VET that was free.. She said bonnie my puppy was under weight and had several virsus. The contract I got reassured me that she was healthy with no defects. I contacted them, they hung up, I went down there and told me I can trade??? she died 2 months later, medication was $2,200. They said come and take your pick...\nGot a 2nd puppy, he was healthy. but is not pruebreed. They said they cant promise that he is. Hes so not but we love him anyways.\nMy advice is if your gonna get a puppy from there, look at that contract, make sure your puppy is not skinny or sick go see a vet right away. Take pics. Hopefully you wont go through what my family did. \nANIMAL ABUSE COMES FROM PET STORES TOO!!"
1,NY'er trying to find thai in Pittsburgh came across Nicky's Thai.  Curry sauces had too much brocolli and red peppers.... Curry sauce very thin and too much coconut milk.   Had the chef duck special and was very salty .  On a brighter note pad thai and thai ice tea was good.  conclusion this is not authentic thai!
0,"Went in at around 2 pm on a Sunday. Not too busy. Music was kinda loud, dark atmosphere, Tvs loud. Waited for several minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were sitting down, because the sign at the door said please seat yourself. A waitress and a manager passed by neither said hi, went to try and fix a tv that wasn't working. So we left. Won't be back! First impressions are lasting impressions"
0,"Will not be back.\n\nI started having lunch here every day last week (10/30) and was going to continue but then the Manager gave me a hard time about not honoring the HON discount when I forgot my badge today -- went on to TELL me to wear my badge on my shirt \""in a noticable location moving forward or I would not receive the discount\"".  \n\nRealy? Not smart -- my daily lunch business is going next door to the Greek place."
1,This is the third time I have eaten at Iron Chef. Its pretty good sushi and its right by my house.  The server next door at Nicks had told me it was dirty and the kitchen was gross. I don't know why but I decided to try it out again.  Immediately my napkin had a long black hair on it...I wasn't too upset just asked for a new plate.  Then my boyfriends plate was sticky...he asked for a new plate...my soy sauce cup had an old piece of rice in it...asked for a new one of those too...the server kept apologizing which was nice but come on...3 dirty things and we haven't even gotten our food yet! Our sushi arrived and it was ok...it wasn't as cold as I would like which worried me.  They gave us a cucumber salad for free...wow thanks. It's decent sushi for a really good price you just have some risks involved when you go there with cleanliness...
3,"While visiting Vegas for a friend's wedding, my hubby & I wanted to try this place after hearing great things about their alcoholic (GASP) shakes. I had a Malibu Barbie - it was OHHHH SOOOO YUMMY. We also had a Salmon Burger and Veggie Falafel Burger. Both were quite good, and reasonably priced. Definitely check it out!"
1,"Wow - lousy parking conditions for a start.  Greeted promptly and seated promptly.  That is what the 2 stars are for.  After that, downhill fast - waiter brought wrong wine but promptly corrected it.  Hubby ordered tortellini - meh at best - spinach salad for the girl - bland and so dry - asked for extra warm bacon dressing - don't think there was even any dressing on it to begin with - added dressing that appeared to be 99% oil - no bacon flavor and no bacon on salad even though menu stated it was supposed to.  Huge no-no - they need to shorten the stems of the spinach or remove them all together.  No one eats stems!  Anyway - will probably not return as dinner left a huge void in flavor and atmosphere."
0,"I beginning to like food trucks after I ate at this over rated (by mostly female food critics..one female food critic wrote that the owner/chef is easy on her eyes! is she really a food critic? ) dump. This celebrity chef once worked with a certain Ivana in New York, and he comes with some impressive credentials to the uninitiated, uninformed, the clueless and this female food critic !.  But he can't fool the real foodies. \n\nWhen you have cotton candy (as you see at circus and third class joints on main street) as a main attraction it speaks much for the creativity of the chef. The meat was not over cooked or under cooked...just not cooked. Raw meat brought to the table (from which school did this man acquire the fine culinary skills needed to transfer the raw meat from the wholesale supplier on to the table) and it was so revolting I turned  from a carnivore to a vegan and even took up yoga and meditation. However the memory of the uncooked morsel of meat, still sends shivers and anti-peristalsis down by food pipe to this date.\n\nThe truck taco stand at gas stations is hundred times better than this dump. The rock star chef with long hair is seen cooking without a head cover in social magazines and TV shows. Obviously he is oblivious to health department regulations or he is beyond any rules and regulations.\n\nThe desert was a disaster. The drinks overpriced for no reason other than you are dining in celebrity chef's esteemed eatery. I would not be surprised if this place closes soon and the rock star goes cooking for the lazy rich and famous sitting on their fat ass from the loans given to them by the golfing buddy crook bankers   One of my worst eating experiences.\n\nI think the  Celebrity Chefs days are over and the food trucks are the future and Mexican fast food is the future.. It is time they stop these TV chefs experimenting with their \""reduction cooking techniques\"" on unsuspecting people.  It it time they stop fooling people and get a day job as construction workers or even washing dishes or bus boys and girls like this fat and ugly idiot- Poola Doom."
3,"Solid menu, descent quality, GREAT price! \nLoved the atmosphere, dim lighting, digging the paradise tropical theme:) \n\nThe Food: they have make your own shrimp cocktail, fresh strawberries and bananas, bagels and lox. They had a bomb salad bar w this delish seafood salad! \nHot Food: make your own thanksgiving dinner, egg omelette station, pancakes, french toast! Coffee and frozen yogurt w toppings and baked pastries! Fun date night get creative w your buffet! Definitely going back, next time we visit Vegas"
3,"Basically the totally opposite of Newark Liberty Airport.\n\nClean and well-lit. Friendly and courteous TSA members, and fast and efficient layout and service."
2,"Had a not-so-great experience at US Egg. My veggie frittata was really soggy, like a veggie frittata soup. The frozen vegetables must have thawed in the dish."
4,"Beautiful little spot for a fresh delicious crepe and coffee.\nI LOVE the berry crepe and have indulged twice in the last few days. the apple croissant is light flaky and so buttery....everything is stunning.\nThe coffee is strong and rich.\n\nThe creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is one of the real stars and I will have to work hard at trying of few other beautiful treats.\n\nThe chocolate fountain is fun to look at but this is a place for beautifully prepared elegant French rolls, desserts and light meals.\n\nEveryone has been very friendly and efficient. The line isn't as long as it looks. well worth the visit."
1,"Portions are crazy big, but who cares if the food is so so.\n\nAlso, it has a very politically left vibe which I did not care for.\n\nIt's worth trying once, but I will not chose this one again.\n\nI had some pork sandwich thing, Meh."
4,"In vegas, every restaurant is pretty good... but N9NE does it better with little things... things like the best atmostphere, a simple menu where they focus on things they can do well, smores, one of the best and freshest seafood platters I've ever had, etc. etc."
2,"Pulling up to the brand spanking new City Center, my friends and I all agreed:  the place feels like a modernistic airport.\n\nCold architecture aside, the City Center is definitely very impressive.  While being massive, it is also very beautifully done and detailed.  The artwork and design of the bars and restaurants in particular is impressive.  An all-amethyst bartop at one of the casino floor bars; a purple-hued wall of Manet in another....just simply gorgeous in numerous establishments within the City Center.\n\nThe rooms, however, were less than desirable.  While very technologically sophisticated, they are simply average in Vegas terms-  not huge, low ceilings, brownish coloring, moderately impressive.  Similar to what you would find at Caesars or Mandalay, and NOT TOUCHING the Wynn.  \n\nMy biggest gripe about our experience was the extended waiting throughout our stay.  30-40 minutes standing at the check-in desk.  15 minutes on hold with the bell desk (in which case I ended up hanging up and physically walking down there to retrieve our bags), and extended holding every time we called the front desk.  Also, I ordered something from housekeeping and waited an hour for it to arrive.  Bring a book, people.\n\nTo sum it up- I am looking forward to visiting City Center again to dine, drink, shop, gawk and gamble, but I probably wont choose to actually stay there in the rooms once again.  A MUST see property, however."
1,"I hate leaving a \""meh\"" kind of review for an organization that does a lot of goodwill and charity, but Goodwill thrift stores are not on my shopping radar at all. I feel like their prices are overpriced and their merchandise is poorly organized. I'll donate items to Goodwill because I know they're doing good somewhere, but I won't shop there. I recommend Savers, Opportunity Village and the Charleston Outlet thrift stores instead."
1,"Nice restaurant but,\n\nFood is overly spiced. I had the Kobe Beef Skewers and it was way to salty. Caesar Salad dressing was super thick and tasted way to.... i dunno strong and salty.  I took most of the dressing off and ate the leaves by its self. My bf said the burger was so-so and the fish and chips tasted weird too.. even down to the tartar sauce.\n\nthe butterscotch pudding was good, but cookies? i thought it was tacky.\n\nthe presentation was really nice, but i probably won't be back here again, i'd rather go to NEROS. Maybe i need to try the full dinner menu, but the waitress said the food tasted the same... in particular the kobe. maybe then i will change my mind, but for not... ive had way better"
3,The few times I've been inside this bank there's been  no one else there. So naturally they were pretty quick with service.
4,"Sprawling, private, outdoor dining - check. Beer, wine, and cocktail menu spanning 10+ pages - check. Delicious, complex, and diverse food - check.  There are many reasons to love House of Tricks, these are just a few.  Others include excellent service, a prime location in the heart of Tempe, and a beautiful outdoor bar.  The restaurant is truly unique, and a welcome break from the typical tan, stucco box restaurants around Phoenix.  I've been eating here for years and keep coming back to sample new things on the menu.  My latest visit introduced me to the short ribs and they were rich, moist, just perfect.  For starters, we tried the cheese platter, the mussels, and the wild boar... all were excellent.  Dessert was also good, a salted caramel gelato.  Expect to pay up for all this greatness, but it is worth it.  It's a great spot for a romantic date night, or a quiet business dinner in a unique setting.  I'll be back, soon!"
1,"Not authentic mexican food as advertise, disappointed.\nBurn beef, hard to bite commercial flour tortilla, nothing to be excited about, maybe the only mexican is the owner, sad."
3,ooo. prettttyyy.\n\nthe dance floor leads to the outdoor area. it gets kinda gross when the weather is hot because everyone is already sweating and the hot air does not make it better.\n\ni've noticed that the girls here are more ...
3,"Big fan of this location. I loved the Sahara location, but alas, it was closed on Thanksgiving (we found out the hard way...)\n\nCame here instead - were told there was a 1-3 hour wait with no guarantees. After bugging the hostess a few times - she let us know that if we kept bugging her - we might get in a little earlier. \n\nWho knew, just as I bugged her a 3rd time - a booth opened up and we were ushered in immediately. So happy.  Note to self -  make a reservation next year when it might be a holiday night...\n\nDidn't opt for the traditional Thanksgiving meal - as that was likely just being carved and dished out en masse.\n\nNew York Steak, Ribeye, Pork Tenderloin - all amazing, all deliciously moist. The sweet potato mashed-up-stuff didn't tast very sweet-potato-y, but it was all decent. Fried green tomatoes app was delicious! But the blandish chicken seemed slightly out of place - but gave the dish an surprisingly good pairing to tackle the heavy textures and flavors of the fried and the balsamic dressing.\n\nAmazing view by the way - overlooking the pool at night, much better than Sahara.\n\nNeedless to say, we brought 3/4 of our meal back with us. Not complaining at all."
4,"Fantastic service, great food! There was a mix up with the tables for a reservation and the management (Colin) went well above and beyond. Highly recommended for anybody looking for a quality meal"
3,"I really like this seafood buffet!! It's on the pricey side for $50 a person, but this is vegas!!!\n\nEverything on this buffet is good and fresh!! They put out big chunks of sashimi out!! Two different type of crabs and also baby lobster tails!!!\n\nThe roast beef and turkey breast is good and also a huge selection on desert!!!"
4,"In the many years we have been coming to Vegas, it isn't very often I'm surprised. The Frankie Marino Show was more than an amazing surprise! Within moments everyone was up on their feet. The original music out shined the covers. I would suggest bringing anyone (young and old) to this \""super stars\""show. The brothers have written and performed most of the songs. Just Do it!"
2,Inexpensive. Some good deals. Lots of regulars. Friendly family owned.
3,"This is pretty much exactly the fancy sort of place you expect/hope it would be.  I'll start by saying we ate in the lower garden area and not in the older upper wooden section.\n\nMy mother was disappointed by this until she checked out the upper section after we'd finished.  It was hot as could be in the wooden area and pretty cramped.  SO in the end I was happy we ended up where we were.\n\nDefinitely on the expensive side but you should already know that going there.   A massive wine list, good food... sometimes great food, and a really nice atmosphere.  \n\nTIP:  Try and see if you can have your meal end on or around 10:30pm.  One of the greatest moments of my trip to Edinburgh was standing in the little Witchery doorway and watching an army of bagpipers march right by us, within inches.   If you're there when the Royal Tattoo is in progress you might be lucky enough to see it. \n\nI found it far more impressive than the actual Tattoo itself."
1,"The Clarendon has some nice perks, like free wi-fi (however it was not working for one day of our stay), a nice outdoor pool area with a hot tub that stays open until mid-night, and my personal fav: free candy/snacks/water available at the front desk around the clock.  I like those extra touches, and appreciate them, but unfortunately they miss the mark in other areas.  It looks like they've tried to update the rooms, but they have a ways to go.  There were several things that I thought were just plain odd- no overhead lights, and no switches that turned the lamps on and off- each of the lamps (there were 5 in my room) had to be turned on and off by a switch that was attached to the cord.  There's a cordless phone in the room, but there is no directory in the room with information about how to make calls, or even how to call the front desk, etc.  The alarm clock is old and doesn't work, in fact most the buttons were so worn that you couldn't even tell what you had to press to set an alarm.  Also, the bathroom is small, and I had a lot of difficulty getting hot water- all of my showers were lukewarm.  The dead bolt on my door did not work, and I had to get my room keys reactivated three times in one day.  Also, the hotel itself is in a weird location- there is virtually nothing within walking distance.  I will look at other options on my next trip to Phoenix."
4,I always have the beef and egg or ja jang meinn!!one of my favorite take out places for Chinese food in madison!!
4,"Phoenix Metro Retro is a mid century modern furniture store that also specializes in Scandinavian furniture pieces. Heidi and Douglas are the owners and they are the most genuine people! They are extremely helpful and they take pride in their storefront. Their furniture is top-notch and so amazing. They work hard to bring their customers the best. \n\nHeidi Abrahamson also has her silver smithing studio out of the back of the store and her one-of-a-kind pieces are SPECTACULAR! Next time you're in, go up to the display cases and take a look for yourself. Heidi also sells vintage Scandinavian jewelry pieces. \n\nYou can get your couch, your lighting, your art and maybe even a jewelry piece or two here and you'll always leave happy!"
4,"Phoenix House Painting just completed a complete exterior repaint of my home and I couldn't be more pleased.  I highly recommend them.  The owner, John Morris, is a veteran of the paint industry.  The guys that work for him are smart, efficient, careful and quick. My home looks brand new and the best part is they offer a 10 year warranty on their workmanship and materials. Stop by and take a look.  They are the best !!!"
3,"[I should have written my review right after I stayed at Mandalay but I'm a bit delayed on my blogging.]\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Mandalay Bay in the early part of December 2010.  Over the many visits I've made to Vegas, I never intended to stay at Mandalay due to its location but because the room was comped and didn't feel like paying up to stay closer to the strip, I went with Mandalay.  \n\nFirst impressions:  beautiful exterior and interior architecture throughout the property.  Attributes both theme and classic Vegas styles.  \n\nCheck-In\n\nI arrived at the resort on a Friday late afternoon right around the time when check-in generally begins.  It wasn't as crowded as I was expecting so maybe I just got lucky.   The agent clearly directed my way toward the elevators and a few great tips and onward headed toward the room.\n\nThe Room\n\nBefore heading my way toward Vegas, I took a sneak peak at oyster.com website where it shows the actual picture of the room I had reserved.  Clearly, it seemed right on so I wasn't disappointed when I entered.  Nice layout and fairly spacious.  \n\nThe Gaming Area\n\nPretty spacious and large.  Seemed pretty ordinary compared to the other properties.  Definitely more high limit than others but that's definitely expected.  \n\nRestaurants\n\nCan't say at all because I didn't dine at any of the restaurants on-site.\n\n... now, the negative comments\n\nI love everything about Mandalay after my first experience, HOWEVER it's pretty far from the center strip area (4 corners--Caesars/Bellagio/Flamingo/Bally's-Paris) area.  I really don't spend much time in the room unless I'm with a significant other :p  but besides that, I'm usually hanging out toward the center strip area so the walk/cab ride is a bit unfriendly.  I also wish there was some sort of direct monorail system from Mandalay to City Center or to Bellagio instead of taking the tram from Mandalay to Luxor, walk across to MGM and take the tram from thereafter.  \n\nSo the question is would I stay there again?  Perhaps if I'm able to get it comped.  Location is far more important for me than the quality of the room or hotel.  I'd have to weigh all of the options then.\n\nOverall Grade: A / A-"
1,"Good visit to Vegas recently. Disappointed with MGM. Service is not good anywhere we went at MGM. Over priced for the quality. We cruised most of the other hotels and casinos on the strip and MGM won't get my business next time. Not that they were bad, but, their competitors were certainly better."
1,"Wow....where do I start. We headed to Las Vegas to celebrate my 40th birthday and because I love sushi I wanted to experience it Las Vegas style. I went onto Yelp to see what people had to say and discovered Sushi Roku. I literally read through each and every review to see what the hype was all about. Everyone kept talking about how great the wait staff was and how if its your birthday you get even \""better\"" treatment. \nWe showed up for our dinner reservations (and the host staff and wait staff was aware at this time that it was my birthday) and the two hostesses were so cold to my party. We then were seated at a window seat which was great I have to admit, the views were wonderful. \nThe \""waitress\"" finally after about 8 minutes decided to grace us with her presence and didn't introduce herself to us and blankly took our drink order. My first thought was \""wow she is so not personable\"". It proceeded to go down from there. The food arrived so that one person was eating like 10 minutes before any of the other food arrived for the table. She never gave us the time of day but was working the other tables. Finally one of my friends asked her if she was aware it was my birthday and with a cold glare she said \""yes\"". At that point I was ticked, you would think as a wait person (which I have done for years in my past professions) that you would try a little harder for the tip you EXPECT to receive from a group. \nNeedless to say I approached the manager on the way out and told him that I felt very disappointed in my experience there and obviously they should look at their staff members. I would never go back there based on my experience. If you do try it good luck hopefully you get someone nice but dont expect anything special even on your birthday."
2,"Brunch update-\nPatio seating is still great...but please don't order the french toast if you are hungry. Two small pieces of baguette bread don't cut it. If you must, order the french toast from the kids menu...it's not made with the baguette but you might not need to eat again when you leave.\nEveryone said the classic on central was decent choice, though."
1,"Went to see David Spade.\n2 drink min.. 1st.. mojito, it was so flavorless like the pop had run out of syrup but i still drank it, 2nd 7 & 7.. same thing, its like theyre using soda water instead of pop? this time I complained, said just bring me 7up, she did... it tasted like carbonated water TOO! what is the deal?!?! 3 STRIKES YOUR OUT!!!\nI think we got the last 2 seats in the house, very packed.\n4 drinks... $40... give me a break!"
3,"This was a stop on my wine crawl (same as a pub crawl but we only drink wine) with girlfriends. It was a beautiful saturday afternoon so we sat outside. We ordered 2 appitizers, apricot chicken skewers & lobster/shrimp tarts, which were very tasty; and since we got there a little before thier 4:00 happy hour, the waitress waited till 4 to ring in our drink order which was great since it was 2 for 1. Our waitress was great. Will be going here again."
3,"We live literally across the street and have been wanting to come here for a year since moving in. We did last night, and it was great.\n\nBefore ever visiting, Louisiane has a really lovely vibe, candlelit seats spread along the sidewalk. It always looked very enticing, and it was, both inside and out.\n\nThe menu is southern/cajun food, which was a first for us, which was nice. We ordered a chicken soup, green salad, crab cakes, to start. And then we had the dinosaur beef ribs and sizzling firecracker shrimp as mains. We also got two bottles of wine.\n\nEverything was really yummy, the chicken soup/green salad were good. The crabcakes / dinosaur ribs though, were amazing. The crabcakes starter comes as 5-6 small little balls which you can dip and eat. And the ribs, were honestly, some of the best I ever had in my life. \n\nAlso, all of the staff were also super nice. I say all, because unlike other restaurants where if you ask another employee for something, they will say \""I'll get your server.\"" At Louisiane, said person just did the task, happily. Which is how it is in the Europe/Australia, unlike North America etc. \n\nWe had a really lovely dinner. Every aspect was great.\n\nHowever, the one downside to this place, is that I find it is a tad expensive. Most things on the menu feel a little bit marked up than they should be, I feel. But that said, unlike many other marked up restaurants around the city, La Louisiane offers something that is incredibly unique, and executed very well. For a long time, we only stuck to going to BYOW restaurants if we ever wanted wine, because of the intense markup on bottles especially. However, because Louisiane is unique, and offers a great seating, atmosphere and food, it can be argued that the pricing is justified. I'd return for sure."
4,Who doesnt love an in-Out-Burger when your bored or hungry late night and nothing else is open?? High Protein High Fat meal. Very good if your in your bulking stage of the year. Always friendly customer service and food is cooked in a timely manner thank you for the great meat!
4,"Super nice checkers Peggy, Carmallee, and Connie (store manager). Clean and very helpful meat and deli people!"
0,"Worst service I have ever recieved. I go to this Starbucks a lot because it's on my way to work and everytime I regret it. The service is slow, even when I'm the only person in the drive thru. It take them forever to even greet me, and the coffee isn't that great either"
2,"Was starving because of being stuck at work so I quickly yelped \""taco's\"" and found this place right down the street. I knew it was there but it's always empty and I am not fond of eating at places that are empty.\nHowever, it wasn't bad...it wasn't wonderful either. I had the carne asada tacos and the meat was surprisingly steak like instead of thin like carne usually is. \nThe tacos were STUFFED full of meat, a lot of onions and all that.\n\nOverall, it was ok. Perfect for a quick meal like I needed that day."
4,Was here today the food the service was great left feeling full and complete a lot of bang for your buck
4,"Best pool party in Vegas hands down. Back in the day Rehab was the spot now this is the go to. Great crowd, great Dj's."
0,"NOT WORTH THE $$$ Had this pizza for the first time the other day at a work function. Decided I'd get one delivered. 3.9 miles away $5 out of area fee. WTF! ONE 16\"" 2 topping with a side of ranch came out to $27. That's ridiculous. Could have gotten an XL 3 topping plus 12 wings at Barro's for the same price. Will not be odering from here again."
0,"Ich war heute zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fccken im Cubanita. Aber leider muss ich mich den hier schon mitgeteilten Informationen anschlie\u00dfen. Um Brot, Br\u00f6tchen oder sonstiges muss man fast schon k\u00e4mpfen, auf eine neue Ladung Wei\u00dfw\u00fcrste wartete ich 35min! Als dann die K\u00f6chin kam um eben diese Nachzuf\u00fcllen musste ich fast hysterisch lachen: 4 W\u00fcrsten wurden nachgelegt, klasse.

1,"Dos Gringos is definitely bringing trashy back.  And I think the whole trailer park theme has really gotten the best of them.  Two cases in point.\n\nA) Drinks are EXTREMELY weak.  They give you tall glasses, but have very thin pours of liquor.  Thinking maybe it was the vodka, we switched to rum, but alas, the trailer park was just being cheap. \n\nB) The vomit stench wafting from the mens restroom really takes the trailer park theme a little too far, right?  After I reported to staff that puke was all over a men's urinal, it was still there an hour later.\n\nDoesn't that make you yearn for the good old college days??\n\nGranted it was a Sunday afternoon and all, and the DJ and crowd was fun.  A definite fun place to day drink, and bring the pooch.  Call me an old-fashioned prude, but the puke-fest and sucky drinks kind of killed the mood.  And believe it or not, I didn't have the appetite to try any of their award-winning tacos."
0,"I must have caught them on a baaaddd day because all I have to say is \""YUCK\"" and waste of money with their chewy food. Felt like I walked in to a gas station and ordered chewing gum.  Overpriced for the quality of food.  Threw 90% of it away."
4,"My husband went here last year with some coworkers because he saw it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives, and made me go with him this time. It definitely lives up to its hype! We started with the Pimpin Fries, waffle fries much like Chick Fila's with homemade pimento cheese melted on top. My hubby doesn't even like pimento cheese and was raving about them. He got a Mammoth burger (double) and couldn't finish it all, it was huge! I had the Ding Dong Chicken sandwich at the suggestion of our server who said nothing on the menu was as good as it. Chicken breast, some yummy sweet cole slaw, siracha, and crunchy peanut butter made for a delicious sandwich. Whoever thought of putting peanut butter on a chicken sandwich is genius! My daughter had the basic chicken sandwich ad said it was good. We all topped the stay off with a single bowl of banana pudding, which was excellent and fed all three of us. I will definitely make this a regular in Charlotte!"
1,"I think this place can do for a cleaning, some say it adds to the appeal, but you can get the same \""vibe\"" without feeling like needing extra soap when leaving. Drinks are cheap and pretty strong for the price or at least what I expected. I went out on my own looking for chat with some new people to have drinks with and shoot the breeze but it seems like this place is full of groups of people not really into expanding outside of their clicks. Dive bar that will get a group of people drunk reasonably quickly. No music going on the night I went, so maybe I missed a lot of the appeal of it, I will re-visit and update if I feel it's needed."
3,"OMG. The pasties are SO DAMN GOOD. I have been twice and have yet to deviate from my regular order of the Thanksgiving pasty (I think that's the name of it). Turkey, sweet potatoes and stuffing in a pasty, served with the yummiest gravy. They also give you a side of cranberry for the ultimate Thanksgiving experience. Their homemade lemonade is delish...Like Hot Dog on a Stick delish. The service can be slow (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars), so don't go if you are really hungry. Last time I went I ordered the tomato soup. It came to my table cold, but tasted delicious. They also have a large selection of beer, which I recommend because it leaves more lemonade for me!"
4,"Found this little gem at Tempe Market place.  Excellent sandwiches, empanadas, and teas.  Staff is friendly and efficient."
3,"It must be coincidence that my ROTD pick is the place where I reconnected with Eric R. last year and is where he proposed to me last night!\n\nAfter a marvelous dinner at Shabu Shabu Paradise sitting next to Katrina M., we made our way to the M to \""walk off dinner\"" and go to the wine bar.  We had 2 wine tastings, then I asked Eric if he was ready to go...he said no, he wanted more hahaha!  Well I went to the restroom and when I came back and sat down, he says he got me a gift in Texas, gets down on one knee, and asks me to marry him!\n\nJay, the awesome Hostile Grape staff, took some pictures and brought us champagne!  I was in shock so I can't remember all of the details :)  There was a guy and 2 ladies next to us who also sent some wine over for us to celebrate.  We took turns going upstairs to call our parents and left tipsy and stuck together like stamps to a letter!\n\nThanks Hostile Grape and Jay for the special experience, the champagne, and the memories!!!! :-P"
4,"Excellent service from Jenilee, Mel and the rest of the crew! Fantastic food - Egg-zactly how I ordered it! Glad we came here and we will be back!"
2,"Why, seroiusly why do people from Hawaii come to this store buy snacks that they can buy in Hawaii?!?! Uhm, you're paying 8% tax!\n\nWell, it makes sense if you're buying beef jerky. There's a wide, wide, WIDE variety of beef jerky. They used to have the nuggets but that got discontinued.\n\nIf you check in at Yelp, you get a free beef stick."
1,"This is a pricey place with good appetizers only (food was bad).  The hot n sour soup was ok but tasted nothing like the Chinese version.  Pot stickers were good as was the sampler appetizer dish.\n\nThe scallops I had reeked of fish sauce which I dislike and the spicy shrimp dish was ok.  Even with a Groupon, I will not return (well only to try happy hour) - I will go to the outstanding Jade Palace just down the road instead.\n\nThey ripped me off by charging the adult price for the $1 kids drink and the waiter Christopher said he would adjust the price.  They brought back my credit card receipt w/o the adjustment - wasn't even worth the $2 they overcharged as I just wanted to get out of there.\n\nOn the positive side, it is a nice indoor setting and the outdoor patio looked nice."
1,"Okay food. A little high priced though. \n\nHad sushi as an appetizer. That was very tasty. The mains were a little underwhelming. The presentation of my $22 shrimp dish was little more than lettuce with the prawns thrown haphazardly on top. Then it turns out that \""Szechuan Style Shrimp\"" is actually code for the typical \""Sweet and Sour Shrimp\"" you see in every Chinese restaurant in this country. So I feel a little mislead. The shrimp were good tasting, but for the price I think the dish should have been something other than par for the course Americanized Chinese.\n\nThe service was okay. But it was funny that over the time we there we had five different servers service our table."
2,Not bad... the Restaurant.com coupon helped make this 2 star restaurant into a 3-star.
3,Great place for breakfast and to watch the airplanes land and take off - service has been mixed depending on day of week.  Obviously Sat & Sun am are very busy.
4,"I come from a big Italian family and I am grown to my family's cooking. I must say that it is very difficult to find a place that serves food as good as Buon Gusto. I have been to so many restaurants throughout my life. I lived on the east coast and the west coast and been to so many places that just served mediocre food. Some of it was good, but not great. I remember my cousin went to Buon Gusto and she told me about it. She said to me that she could not believe how authentic-tasting the food was, and how it was just like our family's cooking. My mom is such a wonderful cook so I know the difference between Italian food and great Italian food. Everytime I come here, everything is on the money. Every detail, ingredient, and server is incredible. The place is so welcoming, warm, and so intricate. The food is TO DIE for. And I don't know about you but if the food is this good, I don't care how much I pay for it. This place has yet to disappoint me or anyone that I recommended it to. I honestly feel like I am eating right out of my mother's kitchen. Incredible food and service, and I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great quality and great, authentic Italian food. You will not be disappointed at all. I will be coming here for as long as I am in Vegas. There is no other Italian place in Vegas that can fully incorporate true  quality Italian food the way these guys can."
3,"I originally came for the pizza, which is excellent, but I keep coming back for the Italian dishes. O am glad I went out on a limb one night and ordered something other than the great pizza. Now I usually just order the evenings special with confidence that it will be great.\nDon't miss out on the homemade cannoli. They are addictive!"
3,"I have been going to Altered Ego for a while now and absolutely love it! I recently moved to CA and still go visit them when I'm in town!\n\nLet me first start by saying that I did have one HORRIBLE experience here when I made an appointment for a partial highlight and cut with Kasondra on a whim. My normal gal did not have any available appointments so I decided to test Kasondra out-BAD IDEA. I came in and took the time to explain in detail the type of color and look I wanted. She was very sweet during the process, however when she was finished there was absolutely no difference at all!!! I am naturally a brunette and have always liked to have natural-looking golden blonde highlights. Kasondra gave me no blonde color and my highlights looked brassy and unnatural. On top of that I had asked for a trim of my layers and it literally looked like someone had taken a butcher knife to my hair. It was completely uneven! I went into work the next day and my boss felt so bad for me she allowed me to take 3 hours off to go get my hair fixed!\n\nEnter Tawni-the owner of the salon. I called in a panic needing to get my hair fixed as I was leaving town on vacation. The salon offered to put me with Kasondra again but, needless to say, I was not excited about that option. Tawni was AMAZING! She completely fixed Kasondra's botched job on my hair and made my highlights and color look phenomenal! Tawni was also so interactive and engaging the whole time I was in her chair. Her assistant Sonni even gave the most wonderful scalp massage! Since then I will only see Tawni and trust her with my hair! One thing I will say is since she is the owner of the salon and very busy you are often there for a long time with other stylists washing your hair and blowdrying/styling you.\n\nI gave this review 4 stars because the salon is so quaint, the staff is lovely, and Tawni is awesome! I will never go back to Kasondra again, but Tawni's service recovery turned a horrible situation into a positive one."
3,"Visited last week and was very happy. It took a few minutes longer than expected but it was well worth the wait. WILL return, next time in town."
3,"I come here for one reason and one reason only, and that's to see the funny faces people make when they taste some of the samples of Coca-Cola from around the world. \n\nIt's funny. Damn funny. I was a sucker once and did it. I regretted it immediately .\nIf ya want to know what piss tastes like, try the coke from Italy. NASTY. \n\nFour stars for the free, hilarious entertainment."
3,"This place has AWESOME kimchi Chigae, kalbi is ok but kinda overpriced. The service is hit or miss here. \n\nBut probably one of the best korean places on the east side."
1,I went on 28th of December 2014. Everything is Okay except the STEAK. It was not the good steak I expected. I love steak and been to many steakhouses but this place is clearly overpriced. I liked oysters though.
3,"The food here is scrumptious, with an emphasis on seafood, south-of-the-border spiciness and some special touches from the chef. I highly recommend the green chile lobster dip as an appetizer--truly my favorite dip ever (the fresh fried flour tortilla chips don't hurt.) From there, it doesn't seem you can go wrong. Plenty of entr\u00e9es to choose from, running the gamut from burgers to enchiladas to various fish. A couple of veg options. The green salsa is pitch-perfect. There are specials on the board when you walk in. I've always finished just full enough to not want dessert (though I could say I perpetually want sopapillas) but not needing to take home leftovers.\n\nFrom the outside, the restaurant doesn't look very promising, with its shabby exterior, location next to a paint-ball club on a ghetto stretch of Country Club Road (though which part of this road isn't ghetto?). Inside, the ambiance changes to comfortable, well-lit and nicely decorated. Enter and it will be worth your while. (Only caution is to open both left and right taps at bathroom sink or risk getting scalded)\n\nI've gone to this location twice and haven't ever had trouble getting seating for two. Likewise I've enjoyed good service. It seems there have been multiple reservation fiascos because they haven't figured out how to handle larger crowds, which is a pity. I have yet to try their Scottsdale location but will report on it soon."
2,"I am one of the beer nerds that Travis W. was speaking about in one of the earlier reviews and I have to agree with everything Travis states in his review. With that said though, I love new businesses in our area...especially a new brewery. I do not think there could ever be too many breweries. However, I personally was not a fan of the beer selection that is available at this time. But that is just my taste. To me, the higher the gravity, the better and the more hops, the better. But that is not everyone. I love the brewery itself, it is much different then all of the other breweries as far as atmosphere. It is definitely an impressive setup and I look forward to going back in a couple months and see if they have any new brews."
2,"The Rio is aging, somewhat gracefully. While it's not the best, it's not the worst. One thing I found odd, there is nowhere at the Rio that has a selection of craft draught beers."
0,"GONE!\n\nTwice I stopped here to eat dinner.  Both times they should have been opened (Friday and Saturday after 5:30 pm).  Last Saturday was the second time, sign up for lease and the place is \""cleaned\"" out.  I should have known the first time!\n\nUPDATE - April 2012 - New Korean Restaurant is in this Space... \""Inter Korea\""!"
2,"It was ok, but for a strip hotel, I expected better actually.  It was a strange location - almost in the Harrahs lobby.  The waitress didn't get my breakfast order quiet right and forgot to bring me a fork, but I ordered a 14 dollar fruit plate.  And it was good!  I got so much I could not eat it all.  Bananas, berries, yougurt, I think granola too.  It was great!  Just a bit pricy and the atmosphere is eh.  It's pretty much right in the action and I think you can play Keno while you are sitting there."
0,"Yeah, I dont think we will be coming back any time soon here either. I dont know what has happened to this place over the last year, but something really bad has happened to it. \n\nThe water pitcher had someone's hair in it. The waiter made us feel like he was doing us a favor by serving us. The eggs benedict was cold, and so were the potatoes, so we waited 10 minutes for the waiter to come around to sent them back. They came back again cold. By this time the rest of the family had finished their meal so I said screw it, ate the potatoes cold, paid, and left. Gave them a sub-par tweet and they replied that they wanted to make things right with us. Still havent heard back from them. Im done."
4,"I was so excited to hear they opened a Serendipity here.\n\nIt was a must to come and have a frozen hot chocolate.\nWe arrived in the afternoon and it was packed for a Monday.\nWe had to reserve and wait, but the bar seating was open.\nIt was a treat to sit there because we were able to watch the bartender make some yummy drinks.\n\nWe had a glass of sangria which was fresh and just good.\nThe frozen hot chocolate was just as I expected. I tried the Peanut Sin City Frrrozen Hot Mocha which had a shot of peanut rum.\n\nWe also ordered a cheeseburger and sweet potato shoe strings.\nThe sweet potato shoe strings were off the hook. I haven't had sweet potato fries like that.\n\nDefinitely will come back!"
3,Finally!  Hot yoga is moving to NE Mesa!  \n\nFound this new hot yoga studio on Groupon.  Great deal for 10 weeks and you have 90 days to utilized.  Went to visit the studio first before I purchased the Groupon and was sold immediately.  It's nice and clean and they have a great little Green Bar featuring fresh greens juices.  I picked up the schedule and signed up for my 1st class.  I like that they offer regular yoga and the hot yoga.  The hot yoga is intense and it's nice to have an option if you're not ready for it.  The staff and instructor were nice and helpful.  During the class they assisted with positions to get that better stretch and no pressure if you can't do the intense yoga positions.  If you need to take a break you simply lay on your mat take a break and drink H2o.  \n\nGreat schedule options everyday of the week.
1,"I wouldn't really call this place a deli, it's a place to pick up something light to eat.  Really too bad they don't have a \""real\"" deli to go along with their sports area.  Not cheap, like every food spot at the LVH, and food so-so.  If you pass McDonalds on the way to the LVH, I'd respectively suggest you stop there rather than here...you won't miss the food and you'll have a plenty more $$ in your pocket.  Too bad, LVH could use a really good sandwich spot...\n\nOh, and they're not open 24 hrs; they're closed 6am to 11am I believe..."
2,"Had lunch here last week on my trip to Las Vegas.  It was very good.  We had to wait a few minutes for them to clear off a booth, but it was not a big hassle.  The restaurant was very busy.  Our booth had a TV mounted in it, and that was cool. You had no control over the station, however.  It was on ESPN and that was fine with me and my husband.\n\nI had a create your own burger with naturesource ground beef and added some toppings.  It was very good.  I had sweet potato fries.  We could have shared one order of fries but I wanted Sweet Potato and my DH did not.  He had the create your own burger with a lamb burger, blue cheese and jalapenos.  He loved his burger. \n\nThe service was good, nothing stellar, but it was fine.  We both had beers with lunch and all in all it was a good experience."
2,"My bf found this place on yelp and we met up for dinner on a Friday night. There was just 2 or 3 other parties when we entered, and the hostess was very nice and let us choose a table. The menu is very vast, and we spent a few minutes going over it. We decided to get a small order of the jalapeno cilantro hummus with pita bread, which is very good (spicy!). Deciding between a panini and the kung pao chicken pasta special, I went with the special, which was my one mistake of the evening :( It took a while for the food to come out, so I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you were in a rush, but we kept ourselves occupied. The kung pao chicken was not the fried version you may expect, which I was fine with, but it wasn't spicy or extraordinarily flavorful. The noodles they used for the dish were very thick and not al dente which I prefer. My bf had the gyro sandwich and a side of fries, which he enjoyed. I like that they are all organic and everything else I saw looked good, so I will give them a second try."
2,"My husband and I went to check this new seafood buffet out and weren't too impressed. I thought we would have a lot more seafood options, but ended up being more Chinese, Korean and sushi. There were only 2 fish dishes offered, although a lot of shrimp dishes. There was also snow crab legs which were somewhat little, but nevertheless, all you can eat. The sushi bar was good, but not too many options there either. They have a stir fry bar as well which my husband liked. Overall, the food was good, but I don't think it was worth the money of $16 a person. The service was great and the buffet was clean and refilled often."
1,"The fusion cuisine didnt quite work here. \nThe sushi/nigiri was all right, at best.\nOver-priced kanpachi / sashimi plates.\n\nI dunno, mediocre sushi just doesnt cut it for me anymore. For good sushi I would yelp some hole-in-the-wall restaurants with a real sushi bar, and order omakase.\n\nThis may sound bitter but im very sensitive about my sushi. ;)"
3,"Good prices on a lot of cool stuff.  .  The sweets and snacks were on sale 3 for 2, bought some Pizza flavored Gamer Grub here and it's great.  Now I don't have to eat all that greasy food whilst I PvP.\n\nGreat selection of cool stuff and friendly helpful staff."
0,"I did NOT stay here. I did, however happen to hit up the buffet, the last time i was in vegas... DISGUSTING! Ended up being scared away from ALL buffets, because of this one. And the Nascar/Redneck theme is JUST PLAIN STUPID. \nYEE-HAW!"
0,Go somewhere else.  The food is very over priced and tastes terrible. The presentation/plating is well done but otherwise is a complete miss.
0,What a rip off!  Ordered Margarita and they scammed me for premium tequila and when approached...they said too bad you drank it you pay for it!    Too bad restaurants have to price gouge to make their numbers.   I won't be back.
2,"Moving to a new apartment and shopping for furniture. Checked out the Rooms to Go Clearance. Large facility. \n\nLots of materials being sold at discounted prices because they are scratched, some glass table missing glass pieces, one has to really shop an look closely at the products. There are good merchandise too maybe from a floor sample or another season. If you want less flaws then definitely go to the rooms to go showrooms."
3,"HOLY CRAP WHAT A STEAK/EXPERIENCE. \n\nFirst off, there should be a disclaimer that this is NOT like the West Hollywood location... other than the fantastic steaks. This is a lounge/club that serves steak. The music is club level loud and never stops. If you're in the mood (which I was) it's great. As we waiting for my table we drank and danced. \n\nBut, you can't really have a conversation, so if you're looking for initmate, avoid at all costs. If you're looking to warm-up before the club, this is perfect. Slash if you are going to be lazy and not go out at all, this is even more perfect! I get to party sitting down and east maple glazed carrots? MMMM. YES PLEASE."
0,"The name says it all.  Terrible.\nI guess you pay the consequences for being cheap and stopping at the first place we drove past.  $10 for a tiny buffet with the normal free hotel food:  wet eggs, funky already made omelets, oval hashbrowns, thin bacon, and funky fruit salad.  They had a carving station with dry meat that was recommended I \""put a lot of barbecue sauce on it because it helps make it better\"" by an employee.  \nWe did get a lot of champagne.  The only good thing.  \nMy stomach was very angry at me for filling it with what this place tried to convince us was food."
1,"2 stars for the ambiance and customer service only. As for the drinks and the price point for those drinks 0 stars. It was my and my fiances first time in Vegas. We went to celebrate New Years and our first stop was the Luxor. We went to Aurora bar and we were met by a very friendly cocktail server. She let us sit where ever we wanted and promptly took our order. We both ordered a classic mojito. Just from our first sip, we knew we wouldn't be ordering another drink.\nThis was the worst mojito I've ever had. It tasted like plain club soda with a little sugar in it. The recipe for a mojito is simple. Take lime, fresh mint leaves, sugar or simple syrup and MUDDLE it (which is necessary to release the flavor of the mint leaves and dissolve the sugar). Pour in some light rum and a splash of club soda and shake it up to mix well. This bartender obviously didn't bother doing any of the proper steps. By the taste of my drink, I could tell all he did was throw in mint leaves with out muddling, squeezed in a little lime, a sprinkle of sugar and less than a shot of rum. Then he most likely filled the rest of the entire glass with club soda. The tiny bit of rum that he put in just sat at the bottom of the glass.\nI understand once upon a time in the US, a mojito was mostly found in south Florida, but since then it has become a wide spread popular drink that anyone would learn in bar tending 101. It is now as common place as a martini or a cosmo, so he knew how to make a proper one but didn't bother trying.\nAlso, the bar was practically empty! Aside from me and my fiance, there were only about 4 other people in the bar. There is absolutely no excuse for the drink we were given. And to add insult to injury, they cost $12 each. If you want a good bar to go to on the strip, skip Aurora and try Public House at The Venetian."
0,"Honestly, the decor is great, the food is ok, but the staff and service are the worst!  I don't know where they hire the people that work there, but I am so over how we are treated everytime we walk in the door.  \n\nAs residents of the Metropolitan, you would think they would at least remember that we lived upstairs, but after a year and a half, nothing.  They are rude, unprofessional, and completely unaware.  \n\nWe have tried to give them several chances and tonight was our last.  We called in to order food for \""pick up\"" and they told us it would take 40 min before our food would be ready.  We waited upstairs, in our home, for 40 min, walked downstairs to grab our food, and the bartender says, \""wow, I thought I would be getting a free dinner tonight because I didn't think you guys were coming!\"".  I then told him, we were told to come in 40 min, and he backtracked by saying, \""oh yea, it has been really busy tonight, it probably did take about 40 min\"".  No it didn't because our food was cold and had clearly been sitting there for a while. \n\nThen he tells us, if he were us, he would have came a bit earlier to grab drinks while we waited for our food.  If we wanted to do that, we would have.  We just wanted to order a quick meal to take back up to our place...we definitely did not need him to tell us, \""what we should have done\"". \n\nAlmost all of the residents feel the same about Vivace, so I doubt any of their business comes from us, which reflects poor management.  \n\nI don't even have the time to get into everything else they have done to piss us off in the past year.  My $$ and business will continue to go to Dressler's and Pisces where they treat the locals like family.  Take a hint Vivace."
0,Unfortunately this place has closed.
1,"I've been to Kabuki a few times and have never been that impressed. The service is mediocre, the food is decent at best and the cocktails are nothing special. The ingredients seem semi fresh, but there are definitely way better places in the valley if you are looking for delicious sushi. My suggestions: Ra, Blue Wasabi or Squid Ink (depending on which part of the valley you are in).\n\nIf for some reason my review hasn't changed your mind from going and you find yourself at Kabuki DO NOT order the Sangria, you WILL BE disappointed. As for the food -- I guess there are worse places you could go."
1,It was okay. Nothing crazy. I mean all you can eat crab legs and oysters was my highlight.
3,"I've been going here since I found out the opened one up in Vegas. I have been to the one at the M hotel, and both are equal in servcce and in quality if food. The hash is awesome here, my favorite dish is their signature corn beef hash. It is served with roasted potatoes and eggs and is a lot of food.\n\nDon't come here on the busy weekends, because wait times can be in the 1-2 hour mark. I came here once during NY and it was hell. When we got our food I was about to pass out.\n\nThey do offer great drinks and even a free drink if you twitter that yo are eating there. Just show the waiter and they will hook you up with the drink of the day.\n\nOh yeah the eggs Benedict is really good, and I usually hate eggs poached."
1,"No bueno.. Sorry.  Customer service not friendly at all. We did get a welcome at least. Best asada fries my foot. I order asada(steak ) but  the asada felt like rubber bands. Pastor tacos so so, but tortillas hard. The only good thing was the salsas. I really don't think I'm coming back."
1,"I recently returned to this place after eating here several years ago. It has slipped a bit since I last visited. I ordered a beef burrito and beef taco. The beef in the burrito was strangely dry and seemed to have been overcooked - or perhaps it was cooked earlier and then warmed in a microwave. In any event, it was less than ideal. This was a disappointing visit, one I won't be repeating."
4,Delicious!!!!! They have the best Falafels in town and the hummus is great too! The services is great despite it being packed all the time. Seating is limited so I would recommend getting your food to go. I think they should expand!!!!!!
3,"We had a large group dinner here for work. The staff was super nice and very attentive. We had a set menu/price arrangement to make it easier to serve our group. The selections were not disappointing.\n\nThe shrimp and crab cake appetizer were excellent. The shrimp has a spicy punch and the vegetables underneath were untouched... I grabbed them and they were awesome! Crab cakes were meaty and flavorful. \n\nI had a petite fillet, which was cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. It was a great steak. The brined and roasted chicken was also tasty, but you have to like the saltiness of a brined meat. I recommend a bland side item to take up some of the salt.\n\nThe sides of sugar snap peas and loaded mashers were both very good.\n\nFinally, the creme brulee was for REAL. Real vanilla beans, perfect caramel sugar crust, perfect texture and taste of the custard. Really good eats. \n\nThey also had a decent wine list... never a bad thing!"
2,Good food.  Bad service.
4,"It's Hells Kitchen-esq with no yelling (I would have liked to have heard some yelling). It's definitely a themed environment. The foie gras was the highlight for me. great drinks, the bread, the butter, the STEAK! It was an awesome experience."
3,"We made a trip back to Vegas for Thanksgiving.  The weather was so nice, we had no choice but to head out for a few hours on the Harley.  Despite living in Vegas for years, no visit is complete without a cruise down the Strip, so that was how we ended our ride.\n\nI wish I could give the Las Vegas sign a five star rating, but for me this iconic spot isn't the same as it used to be.  It is just too accessible now.  There is always a massive crowd.  Long gone are the days of parking on the side of the road in the middle of the night, running across the six lane mega street to get a photo.  No longer do party buses park illegally in the turn lane and let the crazies jump off the bus for a quick snapshot  to memorialize an awesome night (not that I would know).\n\nNow there is a parking lot....The ease of access has increased sign traffic  immensely.  Useful?  Yes, but the lack of the Frogger-esque challenge of getting to the sign, and that fact that you have to wait in a line to take a picture, have diminished the fun and coolness factors exponentially."
4,"I totally LOVE this place. Every time we have been here, the employees have been incredibly nice, helpful, and knowledgable. Their selection is awesome, too, and they have reasonable prices. We mainly come here for dog bones and toys, and we have never been disappointed! I highly recommend this store for their selection and friendly staff : )"
0,"I love El Pedregal, and it pains me to see how few stores there survive. The Bakery Cafe is a place I've been to a few times and had reasonable success with, though I tend to prefer Spotted Donkey upstairs. \n\nOn my last visit, however, I walked out in disgust.  After looking over their elaborate-sounding Sandwich menu, I had a sudden desire for a specific, basic sandwich, and asked for it. I was told I had to order from the menu. Why? the restaurant was almost empty, and my sandwich request was as simple as it comes (BLT) in terms of ingredients (I saw they had bacon in their sandwiches). I didn't care how much they charged me for it - they could have said $10 and I would have been fine with that.  We ended up going upstairs to Spotted Donkey and dropping $50 for a lunch instead - business they could have had. The sandwich menu looked great, don't get me wrong - I just didn't fancy anything on it that day and had a desire for something simple. \n\nThe server was sour-faced and unhelpful.  I just don't get it, especially in a place struggling to survive."
4,"I came to Feeney's looking for steak with my family. I ended up ordering the lamb chops which did not disappoint. However, I finished off the remains of a teriyaki steak, and loved every bite. The mashed potatoes were tasty, and the gravy was excellent. The salad bar at Feeney's was a pleasant surprise that both I and my family enjoyed. If you're looking for a Greek restaurant, Feeney's is the place to go."
1,"The kale salad with chicken was disappointing. It's a pile of shaved kale without much else. The chicken is tasty, but there isn't much on there. All things considered, I think the food is overpriced. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
2,"Full Service? Not really.  Assigned Seating? Yes.  Fast Food style line? Yes.  Tipping? Yes - jar with a reminder phrase about how tipping isn't just for cows.  Also the credit card slips have the tip line on them, but yet again this is clearly not a full service place.  Interesting.\n\nThe awkwardness started when we couldn't enter the building yet there were many open tables visible, and no apparent overcrowding inside.  They have a corral that starts outside with staff only allowing patrons in to where you find yourself paying for the 1st of multiple times - the first is a separate transaction in a standing line for your beer.  And sadly there are only Arizona beers on draft and the large size is only available in a big FROZEN schooner that you often see at old school Mexican restaurants.  After paying for the first time you continue through the line where another staff member gives you an assignment slip for your table.  Better not lose that!  And then you order at the register, pay a 2nd time, and proceed to find your assigned seat.  In my case it was 2 burgers, 2 fries for low $30's (excluding tip and excluding beer).  Shortly after this I found my beer glass empty and guess what - you must go back to the bar or find a roaming employee in your assigned seating area.  So make that a 3rd transaction for my visit.  I'm not making this stuff up.\n\nWhen I thought it couldn't get much worse before I had even received my food I made the mistake of getting a nice tall glass of water from the unlabeled water dispenser which turned out to have cucumber and citrus juices in it too.  If you don't dig cucumbers, you understand the surprise.  But to make me feel better, I noticed all of the signs espousing the \""support local\"" philosophy/religion and such, and for that reason I can see why they'll gain a lot of similarly minded consumers.   \n\nFood quality was in fact fairly good as far as burgers go and reminded me a lot of Smashburger, but then the inevitable comparisons of how they run the business came to mind.  \n\nIn the end I find myself leaning in one of two separate directions. If I'm going to dish out this much money for burgers and beers I'd rather just be at a full service place.  Or, if I'm going to be corralled into standing lines and such then maybe I'd rather just be at a Smashburger-like place where the food is just as good but without the big dent in my wallet."
0,"I'd give this zero stars if I could! This is twice I have come to the coffee and donut place only to find out they are out of the Box O'Joe! I won't be giving this location any more of my time. Craig Road location, please don't fail me!!"
0,"My husband had to do blood work and urine sample this morning. We made an appointment on line for 6 am. He went and had great service,Unfortunately he had to bring back the urine sample later this morning. He had completed the paperwork, sample in the sealed plastic bag. \nWe returned about 8:30 am to drop off the package. The person at the front desk was plain RUDE. He should have been able to drop off the package without waiting or a smart Mouth! Instead he was told if he couldn't wait till she took care of about 20 patients he should do what ever he needed to do.\nWhy they don't have a basket next to her with a sign that's says\n \""Lab Samples only\"" so no one waits or bothers that desk person. Since she has NO customer service maybe she needs to be replaced! Lots of people are looking for work."
2,"C'est avec une certaine impatience que je fantasmais sur ce restaurant... un peu trop peut-\u00eatre.\nNous avons partag\u00e9 des \""croquettes\"" au foie gras : vraiment rien d'extraordinaire.\nEnsuite, je me suis laiss\u00e9e tent\u00e9e par la cote de cochon heureux: viande tendre et bien cuite, mais la sauce n'\u00e9tait pas assez tasty \u00e0 mon gout. Mon ami a pris le magret de canard, pour le coup clairement d\u00e9cevant.\nTarte aux pacanes excellente, mais vient-on ici pour \u00e7a?\n\nVraiment contente d'y \u00eatre all\u00e9e, mais plusieurs restaurants dans la meme gamme de prix me rendent bien plus heureuse."
2,"I've had my eye on this restaurant for years now and never had the chance to try it because each time i went to Vegas something always prevents me from coming here. Then finally, i had the chance to try Mon Ami Gabi for the first time last month. \nI made reservations on Sunday for a party of 6 at 6pm and when we arrived we got seated right away. My friends and I ordered many of the popular items and tried each other's meals. Things i've tried: \n- Smoked Salmon: This was pretty tasty. Went very well with the bread they gave you. \n- Escargots: I didn't try this, but my friends said it was okay.\n- Filet Mignon: Cooked with a batter that surrounded the steak. I didn't quite enjoy it and thought it wasn't so flavorful\n- Steak Bordelaise: This one was actually really flavorful and better than the filet mignon to me (surprisingly because it was half the price of the filet mignon)\n- Chicken Grandmere: Mediocre, nothing special about this chicken. \n- Caramelized sea Scallops: Very salty and not that tasty to me \n- Pork Pillard: thick cut, kind of chewy. Not that great to me \n- Mac & Cheese: It was cheesy but not the best mac and cheese i've tasted. Kind of bland\n- Aparagus: Mediocre, nothing special \n \nOverall, i was a bit disappointed with this restaurant. I thought the food was going to be top notch, but everything tasted mediocre and didn't blow my mind. I enjoyed the fresh bread and pickled carrots they gave in the beginning. Service was a bit slow due to the high crowds. Ambiance is a bit loud and voices echo because we sat in the patio area. Pretty restaurant. Great views of the Eiffel towel along with the surroundings. I would not come back if i was in vegas and it was truly a one time thing."
0,"Tried this place out for the first time yesterday since the hubby was craving boba, and it was the closest one on our way home. I got the honey lemon tea, while he got the strawberry tea. My drink okay, not overly sweet, and had a hint of a rosy aftertaste, probably from the tea. His tea, however, sucked pretty badly. First they got his order wrong and gave him a strawberry milk tea. It would have been okay had his drink tasted good, but it tasted terrible. Despite him not wanting to, I forced him to take it back since it was their mistake anyway. They finally gave him his strawberry tea, but to his disappointment, it tasted like faucet water with an over abundance of sweetener. It was so bad that he threw his drink away after only a couple of sips. Maybe it's just us since we are used to the quality of tea we get at QQ boba in henderson, but this place really isn't worth coming back to."
0,Filiberto food with high restaurant prices. Tried it once before and thought maybe I got something bad. But I was wrong. This is just average mexican good posing as fine food. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Mexican food. I would recommend restaurant Mexico on mill if you want great Mexican food that doesn't try to church up it's prices
4,"You know what I love about this place?  The first time I went in, I asked if I could take the shoes for a run around the parking lot to test the foot-strike, support, and overall feel of the shoe.  \n\nRather than look at me like I was a space alien who had just asked for a pair of Moon Boots in a size beyond the comprehension of earth people, they smiled and said \""absolutely.\""  To summarize, they get runners and why we do the crazy things we do.  \n\nI have since purchased every running shoe from them, and if you want something they don't have they'll order it for you.  Sometimes I'll go in just to see what's new in the world of running.  They always have plenty of flyers regarding races, running clubs, demos, nutrition, etc.  It's a little runner's paradise!  \n\nAlso, I'm almost 100% sure every employee is a runner because anytime I ask questions, they're always well informed.  I've never gotten an \""um, not sure I don't really run\"" from any of them.  \n\nKeep up the great work!"
2,"This place is interesting to say the least. The room that we were in did not have any emergency fire sprinklers. We contemplated having a bonfire since we wouldn't have to worry about the drowning ourselves by accident. \n\nThe 3rd floor ledges are angled strange. If you were to trip with the sliding glass door open, you would very easily slide down 3 stories to meet the grim reaper. The room setup looked similar to something out of a 1970's adult film. Yes, that kind. With all of the hair. \n\nI couldn't help but feel the bathroom and it's door had a similar setup to a gas chamber. While gas may be released in the bathroom, it definitely made it a little uncomfortable. I did however get a lovely view of someone's backside from the rectangular window that is attached to the door. I think we can agree that we both got a free show while I was in the shower. \n\nThe biggest issue with the whole entire room however was the lamps. The lamps looked very similar to a Pope hat. I spent countless hours attempting to unscrew the lamp in order to get a funny picture of me wearing said \""Pope\"" hat. I'm never going to be the Pope. It would have been a nice family friendly Kodak moment. And I would've gladly put it back the way it originally was supposed to be. I was left extremely disappointed when I left with the lack of any Pope hat pictures. It was upsetting enough to make me consider never staying at the hotel itself again. \n\nHowever, the food is amazing. The staff is very nice, even when requesting plungers (long story), and the memories made there are unforgettable. Despite the fact there were several cases where life could be compromised. \n\nAlso they need metal signs that are not as sharp. Someone we know may need a Tetanus shot due to sharp metal signs in the area. \n\nPS: Please make the lamps more Pope hat friendly."
2,"To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. We ordered the 3 course prix fixe for $60. The Caesar salad was good, but not great. I ordered the filet, 5 oz that came with a great sauce. Unfortunately, when the sauce ran out the meat itself was rather dry, something you wouldn't expect with a filet. The chicken my partner ordered was also pretty dry without the sauce.\n\nDesserts were excellent, but a little small. For example, there were only two donuts to go with a lot of dipping sauces.\n\nBtw, the tap water the serve seems to be unfiltered, it has that rather odd Las Vegas taste to it. I'd recommend ordering a cocktail or wine.\n\nThe service for us was excellent and attentive, and the restaurant itself is beautiful. I just wish the food was better given the price."
3,"Open 24/7!\n\nHonestly, I don't remember what I had but it was good! \n\nAll I know is, if I were hungover, I will hands down convince all my other hungover friends to go here and have some good, homemade Vietnamese food!"
3,"I really love this place! my family and I came here once they started on their vegetarian  kick many years ago, and boy we weren't disappointed. \n\nTheir falafels are to die for and the lamb salad is crisp and fresh. My sister is in love with the chicken hummus plate, they provide you with a large serving and it tastes amazing! The hummus is smooth and rich in flavor. \n\nEvery time I'm on a date or am looking for a fun food place with friends i bring them to Aladdin's. My sister even ordered their food for her graduation party. They are great for any occasion!"
0,"Very disappointing experience.  No ambience, no panache. My wife and I went here for lunch. I had BBQ salmon, she had the ribs.  Salmon was ok, tasty. Ribs were non descript and the portion was tiny. No potato served with the ribs, just the ribs and 2small fried okra.\nThe service was bad,  simply awful. The waiter did not know the menu. My wife ordered Pelligrino and we wanted to share a large bottle. The waiter claimed they only had one size so I ordered iced tea. When they brought the water it was in fact large and shareable however the waiter filled two glasses and then took the bottle away????  No check back from waiter until the very end of our meal. The dinner rolls were yesterday's from a local grocery store.\nAll in all a truly pedestrian experience at Strip prices......"
0,"Eww!  \n\nThe ten of us had spent the morning snowshoeing and we were hungry so...\nWaited 40 minutes to get seated in a half-empty restaurant and were immediately told \""with separate checks it will take much longer to get your food\"".  40 minutes later  the waiter did not remember who ordered what, food was cold, the 'fish' in the fish and chips was obviously frozen and was mushy.  One of our diners asked for balsamic vinegar and was given soy sauce instead - imagine his surprise!\nFacility is worn and dirty.  Food on the worn and frayed carpet, wobbly chairs, etc,,  I could go on.\n  \nMy suggestion? Pack a lunch or perhaps try the lodge up the canyon."
1,"I've never written a review before but after my experience here, I thought I would come and give my two cents.\n\nI suggested coming here with my boyfriend and his friend for his birthday since we were on this side of town. Big mistake. The hostess told us 25 minutes and we ended up waiting closer to 45 minutes. When our friend asked about the long wait they assured us that the 7 tables in front of us would be seated if we waited just 10 minutes more. I wish they would've just over estimated the time so we would be prepared for a long wait. \n\nI have never been more embarrassed in my life to suggest a place when the hostess seated us at a wet table and threw the menus down and walked away after seating us. After that, it didn't matter how hip or delicious the food was, I am never going back here."
3,"R.I.P.\n\nChocolate Swan \n[January 1983 - March 2009] \nResident of Mandalay Bay\n\nAfter a courageous 16 year battle with erratic consumer demand and developing trends, Chocolate Swan passed away peacefully at their home in the Mandalay Bay. CS was very popular amongst both its peers and clients for making some of the most delicious desserts on the Strip. Their eclairs were among the best in the resort, and their cakes so beautiful that brides often called in advance to place orders for their big day. CS reached out and touched the hearts of so many with their delicious treats. \n\nI will add, the minute I discovered they had passed (it was a little over three minutes ago) was a sad one for me. For the family and friends of Chocolate Swan, I shed a virtual tear.\n\nPlease forward all donations, warm wishes and condolences to: Mandalay Bay, 3950 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, NV, (877) 632-7800"
0,"After being asked by a fellow yelper to elaborate, here it goes. \n\nWe approached the hostess and asked for a table for 3 plus a high chair. When she jokingly said \""no\"" I laughed and proceeded to ask for a menu to which she again replied \""no\""! I guess this was her attempt at humor, however after the first time, it seemed to have lost something. By the way, she never really indicated that she was joking.\n\nSo, $50, 1 ceasar salad, 1 spinach chicken whatever salad,  a kids chicken tender meal w/ browning apples, and a failed attempt at a pollo poblano burrito later we were on our way to catch our flight. \n\nOh, in between sitting down and paying the check, the service was sub-par to say the least and worse than the cold, soggy burrito and rubberized tenders. The waitress never picked up our menus and never once smiled. \n\nWhile I understand we ate at an airport, this is unacceptable. Next time I'll be sure to read up on more yelp reviews before I waste a meal here. \n\nThey'll be hearing from me soon."
3,"We decided to stay off the strip this time around. We wanted to relax more, without all the crowds. Plus the rooms were a lot cheaper, so we put the extra money we saved on a rental car. We drove everywhere, so we didn't have to walk as much. It was pretty cool, because it didn't take us forever to get to one location to another. Especially when we went out at night, instead of getting a taxi, we hopped into our car.  \nI was very pleased with the room, it was fancy, but huge and comfortable compare to other Vegas trips I have been on. Only problem was that we booked for double beds and they were only able to give us a King bed, but there was a pull out couch. \nThe food choices was okay. We went back on the strip to eat though, but the bar at the pool was pretty cool. The pools wasn't crowded like the other casinos, plus they had a DJ playing music and the bar was open. It was a nice day at the pool.\nWhen I come back to Vegas, I'll come back to RIO and stay, if I want to rent a car."
3,"The Caley Sample Room is a gem in the western side of Edinburgh, with a loyal local following and plenty of folk who travel a way to get here. The food wins awards, the beers and drinks are varied and plentiful and it has the best table water in Edinburgh (stuffed with mint, cucumber and whatever else they think will help).\n\nThe architecture's a little odd, but that probably stems from its previous life as part of the nearby brewery. The exterior can seem a little uninviting and unfortunately it lends itself to smokers clogging up the doorway, but the pub opens up once you're in. The restaurant to the right has plenty of covers, set around heavy wooden tables that bring a feeling of tradition and quality. To your right is the rest of the pub, with a long bar that stretches into the distance. Good for a quiet midweek pint, or a busy Friday night, they host regular live music nights and other special events.\n\nThe staff know they're stuff about the menu and the drinks on offer, which is all you can ask. Fortunately I've always found them friendly too.\n\nIt's well worth your while calling in to the CSR if you're in the area - near Fountainbridge, the canal, Gorgie Farm and the other delights of this side of town."
2,"I never knew how to rate this place... I totally dig the food, but the ambience and the service is just plain...well... weird.Most of the time you get stuck sitting in a sea of people. I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria.. I understand it might be a 'hipster' crowd that eats here usually, but do your servers have to look homeless? Do any of them ever smile?Or shave?I have never had a complaint about food consistency or anything, but maybe lower the prices just a little. Hummus is delicious, but not worth THAT much on my bill. I enjoy the falafel and a lot of their pita options. Do you notice I am trying to have the pros outweigh the awkward cons? I'd give it five stars if the prices were a little lower, and the service was more upbeat. That's all."
1,"It was just okay.  We've been to numerous Sushi restaurants in Charlotte, Davidson & Asheville, and this was probably our least favorite out of all of them.  It wasn't \""bad\""..just very boring.  We have another restaurant.com coupon from the Ayrsley restaurant so maybe that will be better."
1,"I was so embarrassed that I picked this place for my girls night out. When we got there we were early so the waitress sat us at the table and gave us water and menus, that was really the last time she approached us until later. The table next to us had two ladies waiting for their party to arrive within 15 mins the waiter came over and asked them if they wanted some wine while they waited. I was shocked that we didn't get the same service. Finally our group arrived and again we had to wait to get anyone's attention. I then got up to get our waitress to let her know we were ready for our tasting. I was really excited for the evening and for my friends to try the winery out for themselves. \n\nWe finally got to order. Two of us were doing the wine tasting so our waitress explained that we needed to pick five wines. Well to our surprise when we were picking out wines I guess we were not moving fast enough because the waitress roll her eyes at us. I could not believe we were getting the kind of service. We were nothing but nice and said our thank you's every time she came over to drop something off. This waitress completely ignored us most of the time. We would try to get her attention (she was standing at the register right in front of us) and she would just walk away. \n\nI have never been treated like this at any establishment. I am just embrassed that I raved about this place and we got this kind of service. I was about ready to leave after the second glass of our wine tasting but we stayed to the end.  We then left to go to Malee's on Main for dinner and let me tell you their service made up for the horrible service we received at Su Vino Winery."
3,"I stumbled upon The Wine Loft one Monday evening and I'm so glad I did! I've been looking for a Wine bar type place that stays open relatively late (why do so many close so early?!). Well, this place definitely delivers. I've only ever been during the week and it hasn't been that crowded (which is perfect). I post up on one of the leather couches and enjoy a glass (or three) of wine. They also have specials each night of the week so check them out! They have nights with half off apps, half off wine, etc. It's a great place to go and hang out, chat and catch up with friends. The staff seem knowledgeable and always willing to help! \n\n I've had some of the appetizers, the Mezza plate (olives/hummus/feta dip) and the Caprese salad. Both were good but I though that the Mezza plate could have come with more olives. I also had the chocolate mousse dessert and wow - it was so rich and chocolaty! Yum!! \n\nAlso - if you have any type of groupon/restaurant.com deal, know that these cannot be combined with their daily specials."
4,This building itself is just beautiful even if you don't step inside. The reading rooms upstairs look like something from inside a palace or cathedral. The call system for requesting books from the stacks below was way ahead of it's time. Take the time to check this place out.
2,"Had a perfectly edible lunch yesterday at the St. Tropez.  Armed with our American Casino Guide coupon, my family stopped here because we happened to be in the neighborhood.\n\nSalad was not extensive, but what was there was fresh.  The marinated artichokes are a highlight.\n\nMost of the hot foods appear to be of standard mid-level buffet quality:  Generally edible, but rarely exquisite.  One standout is the Spicy tofu: normally I don't like tofu, because it is so bland. However this added enough flavor to make it taste good.\n\nAlso, they have a gelato bar, which turns an otherwise uninspired dessert station into one worth stopping at.  I recommend the blood orange, coconut, chocolate, and pistachio flavors.\n\nI'm not sure which marketing intern came up with the name \""St. Tropez Buffet,\"" but the only thing similar that I could find to anything having to do with the French Riviera was the fact that the deli station offers cheese.  However, none of the cheeses appear to be French in any way.  I believe every restaurant should have at least some vague connection to its namesake.  (For example, the Orleans French Market buffet sometimes has crawdads.)  I've never been to St. Tropez, France, but I know enough about this buffet that it has no resemblance to St. Tropez in any conceivable way.  This patent disregard for its inspiration cost the St. Tropez buffet 1/2 star in my rating."
0,"Bland food, over-priced, slow service, and dirty.\n\nI walk in to the restaurant and it is warm and reeks of grease.  You know when you can just smell the grease lingering in the air.  The ventilation system needs to be improved or considering how well the place is cleaned the hood system may need a deep cleaning.  The soda fountain has exposed lines and an open drainage system, very unsightly. \n\nAs I am standing there waiting 10 minutes for someone to take our order I started looking around the place.  The walls are dirty, I cannot even guess the last time the fryers were moved in order to clean the old food and filth underneath them.  The fryers have old caked on grease on the sides, again couldn't even fathom a guess as to when it was cleaned last.  My arms stuck to the table we were seated at.\n\nFor a fast food restaurant it took 45 minutes to get our order because they literally fix one ticket at a time.  Sadly, there was only 3 tickets ahead of ours.  We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.  I knew I should have insisted when go somewhere else but my wife really wanted to try the place out.  I had to drive straight home and I spent the next 30 minutes vomiting.  I can make substantially better fish n' chips at home for a fraction of the price and time it took them to fix our order.  Drive out of your way to find a Long John Silvers you will be way better off."
3,"My husband, daughter, and I were checking out the beautiful newly opened Tivoli Village last Thursday, and Brio Tuscan Grille was one of the few restaurants that were 1.) already up and running and 2.) had a wait less than 20 minutes during the lunch peak hours.  \n\nThe service was FANTASTIC, and that is probably because they just opened and are still in that \""honeymoon\""  phase.  Along with crayons and the kids menu to color, they also brought Pizza dough for my daughter to play with. They even offered to cook it for her when she was done- but she was having too much fun just playing with it. \n\nI have never been to a Brio Tuscan Grille before so I had no expectations.  In fact, I didn't even know it was a chain restaurant at the time. Nonetheless, I am a fan of the food.  I ordered the Fettuccine Rustica and I highly recommend this dish if you like sun dried tomatoes.  I added the Bistecca Ensalata for an additional $3.95 and this salad was a meal in itself.  It was so delicious and so filling- I may just get a whole order of that next time since I am a sucker for gorgonzola cheese and bacon!  My husband ordered the chopped salad to start with and the Shrimp and Crab cakes.  It had only come with 2 average sized cakes, but they were so flavorful and surprisingly quite filling.  We ordered the kids lasagna for my daughter, and for $4.95- this was practically an adult serving.  In fact, the three of us shared it because it was that big, and that delicious! \n\nThe dessert display looked too fabulous to pass us, so I ate about 1/4th of my delicious pasta and had the rest packed up to take home.  We ordered the creme brulee and the raspberry cheesecake and both were the perfect way to end such a satisfying lunch.  The total bill for the 3 of us was less than $50. And it was well worth it- the ambiance, the service, the food were all great."

4,"This restaurant is a jewel in the city of Las Vegas. I urge all to experience a meal here. I am surprised at the wide range of flavors that come out of one kitchen. I have been here at least 10 times and haven't been disappointed once! Some may comment on the prices at first but once you see the portion sizes such as their veal parmesan portion it is actually a deal! They offer other incentives like coupons on restaurant.com (make sure you read the fine print), and Mondays are half off all bottles of wine. Dine in then tell your friends."
0,"I'm sure at one point in time Max Brenner was on point for food and service, but with the recent news that this location is closing on April 13th, I feel like this may have deflated some of the employees, and it is reflected in their service. \n\nWe were seated as soon as we got to the restaurant, and our server was very warm.  My girlfriends and I started with two white chocolate chai, one being with soy milk.  When our server brought the drinks out, I asked which one was with soy milk, and received a \""I think it's this one?\"" in return.  Strike one.\n\nWe hone in on what we want to order.  I ordered a Lazy Breakfast with sausage, cheddar cheese, and onions, and the girls ordered their plates.  We waited for about 20 minutes, and our server returns with plates in hand.  I take a peek at the meal, and notice it's bacon with no onions.  My girlfriend's order was also incorrect.  Strike two.  We informed our server, and he immediately took the plates back, and had the manager come by to let us know that it wasn't our server's fault, however the fault of one of the chef's in the back.  He apologized and let us know that we would be receiving our meals in a few moments.\n\nWe waited for another 15 minutes for the food to arrive.  At this point, our third friend was nearing the end of her meal, and we were just beginning.  Whatever, no big deal.  We're making the best of it at this point.  We stop our server and ask for ketchup and extra napkins.  He gives us a thumbs up and replied that he would be back in a few moments.  We waited for about 10 minutes before we flagged another server down.  Strike three.  **You're Out!**\n\nThe food was mediocre at best.  It was a simple egg scramble with sausage, cheese, and onions with a side of country potatoes.  The only part of the meal that was unique was the sugar biscuit with the side of chocolate fondue.  It was pretty decadent for breakfast, but still delicious.\n\nAs we were nearing the end of our meal, we ordered two mochas to-go (one with soy milk, once again), and asked for the check.  After another 10 minutes of chatting and waiting, our drinks come out with the bill.  I ask our server which of the two drinks was the one with soy, and once again I'm faced with a blank stare.  Strike one.  I give him my card to pay for our meals, and he returns after a few moments with the receipt.  I take a look and notice that he's overcharged us on our bill.  Strike two (but I suppose I should have looked at this prior to giving him my card.  I'll call this strike one and a half.)  We point out the mistake, and he promises to alleviate the situation.  He takes the receipt and leaves our table for another 20 minutes to speak with the manager to fix the amount.  Strike three for the amount of time we've been sitting at the restaurant with the intention of a quick breakfast prior to leaving Vegas.  **You're Out!**\n\nOur server arrives back and theatrically rips up the receipt stating that it wouldn't be charged on my card, and that the transaction was voided completely.  He notifies me that he would return with the proper receipt with the updated amount.  While he's away, I check my Chase app to find that my card had indeed been charged and placed on a hold.  Strike one.  I understand there are certain policies in place, but it would've been much more appreciated if he had correctly informed me realistically of what was going to happen: you're going to be charged, we'll refund that amount after a few days, and you'll be charged again for the proper amount.  After his return to the table, I showed him that it had been taken out of my account.  I'm once again faced with the blank stare that I've grown accustomed to during this visit.  Since for some reason I wasn't able to obtain a receipt of the voided transaction, I asked for something in writing stating that the amount would be refunded.  He leaves for another 15 minutes to acquiesce my request.  Strike two because we've been sitting here frustrated for close to two hours.\n\nI end up paying once again and speak with the manager who has already come by our table for the food mixup.  I ask if there's any way I would be able to retrieve a copy of the original receipt, and he declines.  I ask about the timeframe on the refund, and he states that it should be applied by the evening.  He became defensive stating that this \""happens all the time\"" and it's \""totally normal\"".  He then goes ahead to blame my bank for the pending charge and takes no responsibility.  Strike three, **You're Out!**.\n\nThis appears to be a shut out, ladies and gentlemen.  Max Brenner, you are bad and you should feel bad."
1,"When I first moved to Las Vegas SkinnyFATS was at the top of my bookmarked list. After looking over the menu I was intrigued by the protein pancakes. Not many breakfast places offer this type of option. \n\nMy protein pancakes may have been packed with healthy ingredients but like another reviewer said I was hoping for more health information on the pancakes. Are the protein pancakes on the healthy side because they are high in protein and rich in nutrients? Made with whole grains or oats instead of white flour? The pancakes were tasty but I could barely finish one because they were  dense and heavy. I did not like the turkey bacon because it was too salty and I am not a huge fan of agave syrup in general because I just think it is too sweet. If the pancakes were less sweet it may have worked better but because the pancakes were sweet on their own I could not eat it with the agave syrup.\n\nOn my last visit I custom made a 24 oz shake with strawberry, frozen yogurt, kale, and banana. The shake tasted sour but not in a good way. I could not make out the kale and overall it was a sour tasteless banana strawberry smoothie. \n\nAfter looking over the menu and tasting a few of the items I am not sold on the healthy side of the menu. I think most of their healthy items lean more towards being fat free, low calorie, and sugar free. Some of their breads and tortillas are listed as wheat which can refer to anything that is wheat and usually has the nutrients removed. None of which are healthy or valuable to the body."
0,"I took my granddaughters to get our toes done and we were mislead to believe there was only one, very expensive price. After the ordeal, I wrote an appropriate letter to the owner, asking for compensation, and there was no response. I am willing to always give a positive yelp, but this was unconscionable. BUYER BEWARE! \n\nThis is what happened:\n \nMy two granddaughters and I arrived at Nail & Spa at about 5:30 PM, February 22, 2014. We picked our colors, and were invited to sit and start. There was some conversation about who I was, and what we were doing. I explained I was from California, and wanted to take them to get their nails done. After establishing who I was a where I was from, the people doing the pedicures continued to talk to each other, and every so often \""California\"" would pop out in their dialog with each other. This made it uncomfortable for us as we knew we were being talked about, but not talked to.\n\nThe conversation: \nWhile I was sitting there with my feet in the water, I explained I wanted a manicure, also. I said, \""Just a manicure, no nail polish.\"" Mia (I think that was her name) said, \""$37\"" (pointing at one granddaughter), \""$37\"" (pointing to the other granddaughter) and \""$47\"" (pointing to me). I went into shock thinking, \""Holy cow, what the heck is this place?\"" My mind was reeling with sticker-shock on this high-priced quote. My granddaughter mouthed to me, \""Did she say $37?\"" I nodded my head, yes. She was wide-eyed, also. I could not relax from that point on, nor could my granddaughter. It was like I was being financially raped. Mia kept asking me if it felt good while she was rubbing stuff on my legs. I was so consumed with the cost that all I could do was nod my head, and wonder why it was $37 to get a pedicure. The final insult was when she went to do my nails she whipped out a nail buffer, and started buffing without asking me. Then she says it will be $5 more. I did not even WANT my nails buffed. I have thin nails, and when you buff them, they fray apart. \n\nUpon leaving, my granddaughter asked the girl at the desk how much a pedicure is. She said, \""$23\"" (I believe) That was when I knew I had been taken advantage of. Mia did not offer the basic pedicure. She had only told us one option, and it was the most expensive. I believe this is bad customer service. My granddaughter is so upset; she does not want to go back there again for her brows. Both of my granddaughters insisted on giving me some money to compensate for the cost. That is NOT how that was supposed to turn out! \n\nI would NOT have posted this bad yelp if the owner had made it right, but I am writing this on April 23, 2014 and he has had plenty of time to respond. I cannot say that the pedicure was worth the price in any way. I was not happy with the actual pedicure work that was done, even if I was only paying the basic cost of $23.\n\nAll I can say is if a business practices these tactics, beware! Just look for better, more ethical places to clientele."
2,"Revolution - or Vodka Rev as it likes to be known amongst the student crowd can be a bit hit or miss. \n\nSome of my most memorable nights have been here - and I'm not just talking about good memories.\n\nSome nights, you can spend a brilliant evening here, having fun and enjoying the atmosphere of a full and cool club that is one of the best places for different types of vodka I can think of.\n\nOther times you are crushed, hot, stuck to the floor by spilt drinks and you wonder why the hell you ever came to this place at all. I mean, Secret Arcade is just 5 mins walk away, right?\n\nThats just the evenings mind you, during the day Revolutionm tries its damned hardest to be a hip and trendy gastro-pub, but really just sells burgers with some kind of vodka twist (burgers flambe'd with chilli vodka is actually really good!). The food is decent and the ser ice is quick and efficient. \n\nSo there you go, the food and service is good during the day which is great compared to the hit and miss times you'll have once the kitchen is closed and vodka rev gets going."

4,"Very nice place ,  the ladies are very polite and friendly I would recommend  any one go there and get one of the best massage's you have every had and only 30 dollars , very good deal !!!"
0,"My wife and I looked forward to eating here for weeks. We decided to get one of our favorites tonight, bbq pork ribs. Let me say... extremely disapointed! Neither one of us would recommend this place."
4,"I took my girlfriends Lexus in today.Right off the bat I notice that the here service is phenomenal, hands down, some of the friendliest dudes in the industry. The pricing was way cheaper than the rest and they didn't hike up the price after the service. Oh, and the timeliness was ridiculous! I was told I'd be there anywhere from 30 mins to an hour...20 minutes, BOOM, done!\nWhat Mexicans are to the moving industry, these guys are to the auto-mechanic world, excepts they all speak English.\nI'll definitely be back and recommend this place.\nBuen trabaj\u00f3 hombres!"
1,"Not the best place to dine at. If you want to watch sports, they have alot of TVs but there are better places to go. Also, very smoky environment. I got a headache from staying there too long. I tried their all you can eat fish and chips....its mediocre. I rather pay a little extra for better quality."
0,"Can't say enough BAD things about Sprint.  Without insurance, warranty replacements are $75 and the representatives are combative and unprofessional.  We agreed to pay the $75 because our Samsung galaxy s4 has no signal and were told, after paying,  it would be up to 10 days before we could get the phone exchanged.   So now we are without a phone,  out $75, and paying for a service we're NOT receiving.....just great! Store hours for repairs are wonky also....open at 12pm and close at 5pm.  I so want to cancel and be rid of this headache.   I don't think they even care to lose our 3 phone lines....if it wasn't for the contract I would be running away from here."
0,"I came in here a few days ago to get acrylics, I had a picture of the design I wanted that seemed simple enough- matte black nails with a gold line, and shiny black tips- I never specified if I wanted gel polish or just regular polish I was waiting to see if my nail tech would ask (she didn't)\nI hardly ever get my nails done so I decided to treat myself. My nail tech seemed like she was in a hurry and she was super rude. She kept shaking my fingers and hitting my hand and telling me to relax them, super rude!! \nBy the time it came time to paint them she just grabbed a gel polish and started painting. (I didn't know it was gel until I got the bill)\nAll of my lines were sloppy, my gold lines were coming off, & one nail was completely crooked! She seemed to have difficulty painting the nails matte so she started over and had them all shiny again. I was so ready to leave I told her to just leave them like that. \nI was so upset that I wasted an hour and a half there just to be unsatisfied with the look of the nails and the service. I went to the counter to pay and I told them I wasn't happy with them and if I could get some sort of discount for having bad nails. \nThey instantly got defensive and said absolutely not we don't do that. And continued on to say there was nothing wrong with my nails that they looked \""beautiful\"". You gotta be kidding me.....\nI told them there was a crooked one, the lines were horrible, there were bubbles and I didn't think they were worth 60$. The male working told me if I look too close of course they aren't going to be perfect, Um excuse me? I have never had nails that weren't what I asked for at any other place. They told me that they could have someone else take them off and start completely over, like I really wanted to sit another hour and a half! They told me that I needed to be more specific on what I want next time- like a picture is not clear enough!- I will NOT be returning here ever again. Money hungry people!!"
2,"This place gets 5 stars for atmosphere and it is a favorite of my children for that reason.  However, the service always seems to be lacking in one way or another.  The food is ok and overpriced for what you get.  But, due to the fun environment, we will keep going back."
2,"Been going here for, shit, 10 years? I really want to love it (pakalolo no Swiss sub pepper Jack) but lately it's been kinda pissin me off, for all the reasons mentioned by everyone else here.\n\nGreat subs, not so much meat on them, kinda pricey, ultra slow, thumbs up for having mtn dew on tap.\n\nOh, and not green/sustainable at all!! Tried to redeem about 5 punch cards totaling 10 punches for a free sammich but they wouldn't let me. They could have just reused the cards, giving the ones with one punch to the next customers instead of punching and wasting all new cards.\n\nHippies my ass . . .\n\nI will probably be going back, though not nearly as much."
1,"I hated this place. Horrible service with really rude staff. They give you a rotten look when you cheap out on the tip... well guess what? Bad Service = Bad tips.\nThey messed up my order, it took 3 times before they got it right. I see making a drink is such a hard job. \n\nI don't understand what the rave is about, but its just a bar with no flare. I won't be returning here."
4,"The food was solid, pork chops and scallops were flavorful but not over bearing and cooked to perfection. You get the full simple flavor of the protein. But overall the service was amazing! Erik our server and Sherlene the hostess were incredible, we didn't order anything from preference. Literally they ordered everything for us and it was all great! The cocktails were refreshing and balanced. Usually employees up sell you on everything the restaurant wants them to sell but they made this experience great. We will be back for sure just to experience service like that again! Usually small talk with the server could get a bit intrusive, but Erik was awesome to chat with, at times we felt bad holding him in conversation, but enjoyable nonetheless. Thank you!"
2,"I like fudge just as much as the next person but do I want to pay \u00a34.85 for a slice... probably not although once in a while I guess it does no harm. It's great to see the fudge getting made and the staff always talk customers through the fudge making process... if you're interested that is. It's a pretty skilled process and a few years ago my mums attempt at making fudge resulted in the fire brigade being called to the house and the remnants of the fudge a black chalky disaster. The less said about that the better.\n\nThe huge copper cauldron where they stir the ingredients reminds me of witches brewing away at a potion but rather than making something to turn your worst enemy into a frog you get the sugary goodness of fudge and they're always giving away free samples!\n\nMy favourites are; After Dinner Mint, Strawberries and Cream and Vanilla.\n\nOverall the Fudge Kitchen is definitely a novelty shop and unless you have money to throw away or the thought of having no teeth is appealing I'd save it for special occasions."
4,"I'll be honest, I hate going to the bank. Totally hate it. But as far as banks go, this place is top notch. The staff is professional and courteous. The service is always a step above. If you have to bank (and we all do), you might as well bank here."
4,"I love Ace Hardware. It is like an old-fashioned hardware store; not like your big box Lowes or Home Depot. It's small and quaint and the same four people work there every day. And, if you go in enough times, I suspect it would be like walking into the Cheer's bar  -- where everybody knows your name. \n\nThe fact is, Ace Hardware has just as much stuff as those other huge home improvement stores. They just don't carry as much of a selection or stock as many items. Nevertheless, every time I have some sort of home repair need, they always have exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nYou walk in, are greeted by the friendly cashier and asked what you are looking for. And just as quickly as you can say \""thingamajig,\"" they show you were it's at. Now that is what I call service.  No need to stand around waiting for someone to help you or go searching the entire 50,000 square foot store for one small item. Nope, like the jingle proclaims.. \""Ace is the place!\"" And, by golly, it is!"
4,The soups here are absolutely delicious! They make them from scratch in the back and they are better than homemade! The lobster bisque is my favorite so far but the mushroom is also delicious! The grilled paninis are really good too. I also tried a few of the salads. The lettuce is very fresh and the dressing are flavorful. They need a 'try 3' combo since its so hard to choose between two! This is my new favorite place. This is a great place to grab a quick bite before a movie.
3,"The car wash and interior cleaning here are very well priced. They make your car look like you just got it detailed! Oh and for the same $18 rate on Yelp silver car wash you can get a gold car wash on Groupon. \n\nWhat irritates me was the guy that seems to be working hand in hand with Alamo; Clear Quality. He tried to tell me that there was damaged to my windshield (which there is not) and that he would fix it for \""free\"". So I proceeded to ask what he needed (I kinda already knew his scam but whatever... I'm curious). He tells me just my car insurance information. FYI filing a claim with my insurance claiming that you did body work is NOT \""free\"". \n\nAlso, \""Felipe\"" who's shirt said supervisor said I NEEDED to get my car waxed because the paint quality is deteriorating (I drive a 2013 model). Yeah, no...\n\nBesides trying sell me on things I don't need and treating me like I know nothing about cars; The car washes are great!"
1,"Simply the worst attempt at Mediterranean food I've tasted in years - or ever - there's just no Turkish food to be had here. \n\nNO MORE DONNER KABOB, they don't make it anymore and we had made a detour on the way to the airport for it. Not much else to chose from really\n\nOK, so I ordered a $10 Gyro platter, only this \""thing\"" had never gyrated. Instead what I got were paper thin slices of frozen lamb baloney, greasy too. My wife asked if it was fried Spam. It did look and taste like fried luncheon meat. Even the rice was uneatable, and the two small grape leaves which came with it weren't even as good as the canned ones we buy at Agora.  Just awful, avoid!\n1 star\n\nThe other dish was the appetizer sampler, unimpressive considering it's $11. There was two really hard and bland falafels totally meh I only took a bite and lost interest. A bit of hummus which tasted nothing like a hummus only garlic and oil, my wife thought that possibly they didn't use chickpeas in both the hummus and the falafel. Again a bit of babaganoush, was tasty, very smokey but I didn't mind, and the tabouli was passable. \n2 stars because I didn't die \n\nDesert? They're out of Baklava and didn't suggest anything else, we had a plane to catch so that's it. I didn't see ANY of the items that previous Yelpers had taken pictures of and got the feeling the owner has given up."
4,"omg this place was reeediculously gorgeous! i felt like i had walked into some adult version of raging waters/candyland. seriously, i wanted to play with all the little water contraptions they had, like this stripper pole that showers water on the girls underneath. and this overflowing mini-pool with see-thru sides (VIP tables only i think :(). it was *the* most perfect sunday ever! blue skies, 90 degrees in august, lots of space around and in the pool to sit down, lots of shade, easy-access and clean bathrooms, beautiful people everywhere. i am *so* bummed i did not buy a new bikini for this and put on some heels :("
2,"I was staying at the Encore, and ended up waiting in the Reservations/Guest list line for 1 hour.    Watched while general admission got in just fine.   Finally gave up, and went into general admission after realizing only the bottle guests, and people who were bribing the bouncers  were getting in.    Luckily, the people overseeing that line took mercy(after noting we'd been waiting for as long as we had been).   \n\nThe club was great once I got in, but the night was shadowed by the events preceding.   Needless to say, the club itself is quite impressive.   The atmosphere is highly upbeat, and there are tons of crazy and outgoing people, which adds to the excitement!\n\nRecommend the management seriously look into creating a separate line for hotel guests......Encore is a gorgeous hotel, but  when I stayed at the venetian, I got into Tao after only 5 minutes, and was treated much more cordially."
2,The chicken was fresh and very tasty first time there but greasy cant make it a habit
1,The food is definitely something that needs improvement! The pizza dough is tasteless and overall in need of improvement. Burgers and wings are just average bar food  - nothing special at all. If you like to bet on horse and dog races then this maybe your place to go.
4,"Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \nPerfect spot for a romantic night."
2,"Situ\u00e9 au centre-ville, ce chic resto-burger vous laisse confectionner vous m\u00eame votre burger. Grand choix d'ingr\u00e9dients de qualit\u00e9, bonnes frites et grand choix de cocktailse ce resto \u00e0 l'ambiance trendy s'ajoute bien \u00e0 la liste grandissante des chic burger. C'est ch\u00e8re mais c'est bon!"
2,"The service was awful. It was probably 15 minutes to get menus; three hours to get thru entrees and dessert. We were in absolutely no hurry but geez that is ridiculous. The patio is totally non descript and overlooks a parking lot.  My husband's dinner looked very good, my scallops were fine, served with beet risotto, tasty but there was some sort of puke green sauce that was really weird. The bread pudding was delicious. We walked to music in Stumptown Park after which was nice. A pleasant enough meal but kind of doubt we'll be back."
1,"This place turned to crap.  I remember when it first opened I loved this place.  I thought it was the best Chinese Food in town.  Flo took so much pride into her recipes.  I am not sure what went wrong.\n\nI can't speak for all the servers there, but ours was terrible.  No personality just a freaking robot.  She came up to the table to greet us by saying \""Are you ready to order\""  How about some drinks lady?  I can get by with horrible service if the food is good, but the food was lousy.\n\nWe ordered chicken lettuce cups, 2 different types of soup and 2 entrees.  They tried to bring the soup out first but I asked them if we could get our app first.  The chicken that came with the lettuce cups was just the fatty pieces of the chicken they don't used with the entree, but all minced up.  The texture was gross and the flavor was bland.  The soups were the only reason this review got 2 stars.  Pretty good.  Wife had wonton soup and I had seafood shelfish soup.  \n\nThe entrees sucked.  We shared Crispy Spicy Chicken which was more like Soggy Salty Chicken and the Orange Beef which was decent but soggy which made it not as good.  The server never came by again therefore I went the whole meal without anything to drink.\n\nFor sure we will not be coming back anytime soon.  I am not sure why this place stays busy, it's not worth my time.  If I wasn't so hungry, I would have returned the entrees and app."
2,"Conveniently located. Fine if you just want a quick drink and a sit. They also do takeaway pastry (mediocre looking pastry), sandwiches, and beverages.\n\nPeople were totally right about the coffee being too hot though! JEEBUS that stuff was scalding. My latte was out to torture tongues."
0,"The hotel is a little expensive for what you get, I guess it's the location. The marketing staff need to learn better ways to speak to guests, I would NEVER tell a guest in MY hotel the way the hotel runs behind the scenes as far as who gets things comped for them and who isn't worth it! Food is as expected mediocre taste and over priced! I lost over $9000 there not to be a sore looser, but do you think I'm \""worth\"" giving a room to? Will stay there again just because of location, but reluctant to how the \"" hotel and casino\"" are run. You also show a nice clean bathroom in the pictures but you don't show the mold in the bathrooms."
2,"Service at The Noodle Shop was good, our server was very attentive. Servings are family style and the price is reasonable, we had order the typical.\n\nBeef and Broccoli: delicious!!\nFried Rice: bland\nChow Mein: oily and bland"
4,"The sushi at RA is beyond amazing!  I eat sushi about 3 times a week and if I could eat at RA evertime, I WOULD!  Happy Hour rocks and there's some really awesome stuff on the HH menu!  Absolutely love it!"
3,I love Roy's - almost everything is delicious and the service is top notch.  \n\nThey no longer serve bread and butter?  What's up with that?
1,"MGM Grand Hotel & Casino is one of the more \""affordable\"" casinos on the strip and there's a reason why. It's pretty trashy. Or at least, the people who frequent it.\n\nThe outside aesthetic of the hotel makes little sense and has no continuity with the inside of the hotel (which at least is nicer). The first thing you notice upon walking in is an over-powering scent of roses, a very large lobby with no place to sit and a near-deafening noise of casino games and crowds to your left as you try to check in.\n\nTRY to check in - that's my point to make here. My sister and I arrived at around 2:30pm, the rooms we reserved were booked via our Mother who was flying in later that evening with my Dad to meet us for our weekend Birthday vacation.\n\nWe all share the same last name, all our names were booked for the reservations - and the INCREDIBLY RUDE woman behind the desk refused to let us check in!!\n\nWhen asked why, she explained it was a hotel policy the cardholder who paid for the rooms be present at check in. As frequent travelers, we've NEVER heard of such a ridiculous \""security measure\"" - especially since she had our names listed, and we had I.D.s\n\nAs it turns out, our parents flights were delayed and the baggage check-in fee was ridiculously high (not to mention we didn't trust our bags to strangers handling thousands of bags a day - an easy mixup or theft and our trip would be ruined!)\n\nSo with no place to sit, and the refusal to be flexible (mind you, rooms are usually good to check in after 12pm at any other place in the world) - our room, which had the first night PRE-PAID, sat empty... while my Sister and I had to KILL NINE HOURS lugging our bags for a place to sit that wasn't in front of a slot machine where we'd be losing our lungs to horrible cigars.\n\nWe assumed Vegas would be more competitively priced regarding food, thinking a sit-down meal or two would kill time... such was not the case. The prices of places to eat are higher than ever. The nearest \""affordable\"" place we found was a SUBWAY shop. In Vegas terms, the cost of your predictable run-of-the-mill fast food was twice as much as you'd normally pay anywhere outside of NYC.\n\nSo now we're tired, hungry, and have 8 hours to go.\n\nGetting back to the MGM - this is where we really lost our marbles. Turns out, there's a place within the casino by the pools called 'Television City' - You sign up to be part of a focus group and are PAID to watch horrible TV Pilot episodes, rate them and in less than an hour, it's an easy 20.00 plus some pretty good coupons for the over-priced Starbucks and Hagaan Daz nearby.\n\nSure you lose some brain cells watching mindless TV, but you have a place to sit, you get paid, you get discounts at other shops in the casino - and for us, it would have been a great time-killer as we waited for our Parents all day. \n\nBut did the lady behind the check-in desk apologetically mention this to us? Not at all. Nope. We didn't discover it until the next day. When our parents arrived, it was well after midnight before we really checked-in and yes, MGM still charged us for the whole night with no apology. They have a strict policy against Customer satisfaction. No wonder the company is going under and owes a ton of money to Dubai World Properties.\n\nThe hotel rooms have NO AIR. You can blast that thermostat all you want but the room will not get any cooler. You can crack open a window too but that's all they allow you to do... is crack it. The windows do not open. It's not a jam, it's seriously how they're designed. You can only open a quarter centimeter contraption on the windowsill for fresh air. Our view was of the airport. Whatever.\n\nThe next day we decided to look for the pool. That was one thing we were looking forward to the most - it was a vacation, so let's relax by the pool and catch some sun yes? \n\nNO.\n\nThe distance from the hotel room, to the elevators, to the casino floor, to the pool line (yes, you wait in a turnstyle line to get to the pools) is ridiculous. Not to mention, you have to parade THROUGH the casino, past the nice restaurants that only have views of the hallway... in your swimsuit??? Hell no!\n\nLuckily, we have the sense to not gross out other guests with our non-super model bodies in swimwear... but that common courtesy is not mutual. Almost every girl at the MGM Grand dresses like a trashy hooker minus the trashy hooker body. The best word to describe some of the more.. \""rednecked\"" guests would be... Trailor Trash Spring Break.\n\nFinally arriving at the pool(s), we realized that our hotel was the Wal-Mart of Las Vegas hotels. The more beautiful pools were closed off, and two were open and CROWDED. The hours were 9-8pm or something ridiculous and there was no room to swim. Not to mention they were blasting the most horrible college-rock.\n\nDrunk girls throwing up in the water, Frat Boys acting like animals, children pee'ing in the pool, old people in bikinis...total nightmare.\n\nCirque Du Soleil's 'Ka' was AMAZING."
2,"I went to see Jeff Tracta at The Pearl last Sunday.  I've been here for several concerts but I never reviewed the place before.\n\nI give it 3 stars because of the layout.  If you're on the floor, you need to walk down several sets of stairs.  Floor seats are generally the most accessible but not at the Pearl.\n\nThere are also several little offset places where there's only one way in and out which makes for a backup of people trying to leave at the end of a concert.\n\nThe sound is good, but the folding chairs are close to each other--in fact attached to each other by plastic slip ties which are de rigueur for some venues in this town.  So, while The Pearl has some good entertainment, it's simply OK."
4,"Awesome place.  Awesome deal for locals.\n\nThis place has great prices on blowouts and the fact that it's in Townsquare doesn't hurt!  My friend and I had blowouts and she also had her eye makeup done.  At first I thought it was a little pricey just for eye makeup...until I saw how good it looked.  I can't remember her name but this chick is INCREDIBLE.  Seriously.  Her eyes still looked just as glam the next day (and yes, she definitely rocked that same makeup the next day at the pool)!  \n\nI'm definitely going back and next time I'll have my makeup done too!"
1,"Maybe it was just because it was a Wednesday night and I was tired, but I went to see Jose James with a couple friends at Le Piano Rouge.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a huge fan of jazz and didn't know who Jose James was before the night.\n\nThis was my first time here and it is a small quaint place.  I find the setup to be very interesting for live music, because half the place can't see the stage.  If you just want to go there and listen then I guess that's okay, but still.  They also charged me for three drinks when I only had two, but I didn't bring it up because I didn't have the energy, so that would really be my fault.\n\nAs for the night I went, we went to the early show, which started later than it was supposed to and cost 30 bucks at the door.  I guess I really don't like jazz, because I didn't enjoy myself listening through the hour and a half set.  There was a later show that night, but after stating you could stay they kicked everyone out who was at the early show for people from the later show.  I wasn't planning on staying anyways, but it still was weird they did that for people who enjoyed the show.\n\nI will have to try the place on a normal night to fully appreciate it I guess, but this review was based on my experience that one night."
1,The last time I went I was sooo happy with the food now I'm sooo sad. The day before New Yrs Eve I was craving some good BBQ. I promised myself no more meat except fish starting New Years. So this was pretty much my last hoorah. I was looking forward to it ALL day!! I had a burnt ends sandwich with fries and onion rings. Well I couldn't even finish the sandwich! It was dry and tough and tasted pretty salty. About half way through my stomach started crying for help. I felt like dude on Man Vs. Food I was determined to eat it but it turned awful. I had to stop eating and I thought I was going to die. I had a gallon of tea after that and luckily pulled through alive. Not at all like last time. NOT ONE BIT!! Oh fries were not good either not like McD's they were pretty greasy more like Two Hippies but without the thickness. Onion rings were ok  meh nothing to write about.\n\nStill sad about the whole thing!
0,"Where do I start... Oh yeah. The people watching at this place is wonderful. The abundance of tweekers and crackheads is amazing. With that aside, it's a Mcdonalds! That's all I have to say about the food. The service was not good at all , the staff seemed overwhelmed with a small lunch rush. My order was missing a hamburger ( the main part of one of the meals I ordered), an apple juice (part of a kids meal) and cup for one of the drinks. They did fix it quickly. Oh there was an employee in the dinning area making the floor super sticky ( I think she was mopping with a mop bucket that had cleaned up a spilled soda, just a guess) so that was nice. So I would definitely would not recommend you try this particular McDonald's.  In and out it's just across the street."
0,"Dirty, dank, stinky cars.  One pretty good customer service rep working tonight, one really bad one.\n\nThe girl at the counter is rude, huffy, rolls her eyes at me, attempts to argue with me.  Almost comedic in nature.\n\nAside from the foolishness of the one cranky agent who should be replaced, the cars are dirty- very dirty, and they smell.  \n\nThe experience I had today does not fit into the Hertz brand image nor does it reflect well on the businesses that refer to this location. \n\nThis place needs to get secret shopped badly.\n\nI forgot to mention the tag on my rental car is expired as of June 2014.  So, yea, no one is taking care of the cars, expired tags plus dirty cars makes me sure no one is paying attention."
2,I went to this location yesterday and I was very disappointed. The lady at the drive thru was very rude.
1,"We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone."
2,"It gets 3 stars based on the safety that it is Yardhouse; decent food and great beer selection.\n\nI went with a group of 10, ready to stay for the evening....but after dinner we went elsewhere.  The eating area is big and open enough (I actually prefer it to the one in Town Center).  But thats where the good news ends.\n\nThe wait staff was slow and inaccurate.  They actually argued that the raspberry beer they brought was the dunkel we ordered.  The manager ultimately agreed with us.  Secondly, but importantly, they have a 1-drink-at-a-time rule.....\nEveryone knows at a popular restaurant you order when the waiter comes around.  At this particular YardHouse, they will not bring you a beer until the one you have is less than a quarter done.  So now you must wait another 20-30min until the server comes around to check to even make an order.\nThey let us slide a little because they thought we were a good crowd....ridiculous"
2,"There is nothing particularly stunning or revolting about Jade Garden: it is what it is.  I ordered from here all the time in college - cheap food, specials every so often if you Google it, pretty quick turnaround as well.\n\nI was back in Madison for New Year's, and I ordered from here on New Year's Day, online.  Not only were they open (unlike some of their delivery friends), but they had it at my door in about 15 minutes.  I don't know if I'm scared or impressed, but I'm going to go with impressed.\n\nFood is traditional blah pan-Asian cuisine, but I did enjoy the fried potstickers, fried wontons, and eggrolls.  Then again, anything fried is soooo gooooood.  Chicken with broccoli was decent - broccoli wasn't soggy, and it was aplenty.\n\nBetter Chinese food than most places in Madison, with great delivery times to boot.  Someday, Jade Garden, I will be back."
4,"This is my go-to Petsmart. The one on Craig is much closer, but I'd rather make the short jaunt up 5th to this location because it's cleaner, it's better stocked and the general area is much more pleasant to shop in.\n\nI've been here a handful of times now and every time they have the product I need in stock (Kaytee Orchard Grass in the 24oz bag for my bunny, Lulu). \n\nThe staff is always really warm and actually act like they love animals. Some of the other locations, the staff sometimes seems like they'd rather be having dental work.\n\nToday, the sweet girl at the register and I were discussing my rabbit and she was so informative about whether or not I could pre-order in bulk and pointed me to their website in the event they don't have it in stock. Standard knowledge, but I appreciated that she offered it up, like she genuinely cared that I got what I needed.\n\nFinally, at the end of our transaction, she lifts up my bags of hay gingerly, apologizing, but saying she's allergic to most of the hays so she was just being careful. I thought that was so sweet! She never let on the whole time we were talking that she was allergic or potentially uncomfortable. She just smiled and gave great customer service. I hustled the hay out of her vicinity, but she made a point to ask as I left what my bunny's name is. I wish I had made a point to ask hers!\n\nThat's how it's done, customer service. Thanks, Deer Springs Petsmart!"
1,"This airline is definitely no-frills, as other reviewers have stated. No TV, attendants didn't smile, nickel-and-dime everything -- wot, no peanuts or pretzels or crackers? Not even one lil' bag? Are you kidding me? You have to buy their snack bag to get those. That used to be one of flying's great joys. A tiny bag of salty goodness. Not on this airline! \n\nWe've flown them before, but don't recall them EVER being this tight-assed. We've learned not to check luggage if we can at all help it because they charge $15 per bag. That's insane, but we know that's how they are, so we made do with carry-ons. Of course, that means the overhead bins fill up really fast and makes the cranky attendants even crankier. Whaddaya expect, lady, ordinarily most of this stuff would be checked! The employees seemed rather unhappy all-around. \n\nHowever, the flights themselves were basically decent. On time. It's worth it to us to put up with the lack of luxury when it's a really short flight and my Amex points are covering most of it. But for a longer flight, or if we have to come out of pocket more money, we'd look for a more comfortable airline."
1,"This is the second time that I have tried this place, I really want to like it.....but there are some flaws. The first time I tried it, I ordered chicken pad thai, and what came out was quite disappointing. Way too many large pieces of onion and totally bland, I actually had to ask them to bring the seasoning and sauce that they use because there was literally no taste to it. It was not at all authentic.\nThis time I ordered their daily lunch special, orange glazed chicken and a spring roll. I really think that a spring roll or egg roll should be included with the lunch options, it should not be $1.50 more for a tiny spring roll. The portion size of the chicken was ridiculously small, I think I gulped it down in 5 minutes! At other chinese places I go to, their lunch portions are about double what I received. I will say that the quality of the meat and the flavor of the sauce was great...but speaking of the sauce, there could definitely have been more of it. \nThe final thing that annoyed me was that despite their sign saying they took American Express, in fact, they did not."
2,"Went with a friend and got a Bento box (Salmon teriyaki).  Food was good, but the place is a bit far from campus.  I'm not a fan of Miso soup, but the rest of my meal was good."
0,"I don't even know where to begin.\nThis could be a huge novel.\nI will try and keep it short and sweet.\n\nMy man and I showed up here looking to purchase a new work vehicle for him.\nThey ran his credit right away and with in 20 minutes of us being there asked how much money he had on him then took the cash.\nI was in shock that the guy asked him about how much cash he had on him and took it so fast. Looking back we would never do that again but felt on the spot and trusted this guy.\nHe took us to a Dodge  that we test drove. On the test drive the salesman was telling us how he needed to make a quota and had just a couple days left to get more sales in. He then proceeded to tell us he was going to smoke weed when he got off work.\nI really don't care that he smoked weed or is having trouble making his quota but it certainly isn't something you discuss with customers coming in to buy a vehicle.\nWe asked if I could co-sign to help with the interest and so on and the guy took my info and literally 3 minutes later came back with a blank sheet of paper saying there was nothing they could find on me and I wouldn't be able to help. I was shocked yet again.\nThey told him he was approved for the Dodge and even had him hit \""the gong\"" congratulating him on his new purchase.\nAfter 3 days they called back and said he needed to bring the Dodge back because he wasn't approved for it and would have to wait a week to get his down payment back.\nWe were infuriated. When going to take the Dodge back we asked one of the workers at the desk why they mislead us. She said that the salesman probably needed to make a quota. After remembering what the salesman had said to us it all became clear.\n\nWe went to another dealership and not only did my man get a GREAT deal on a brand new Chevy but they also allowed me to co-sign which brought his interest rate down tremendously!!\n\nThis place is no good I would never recommend anybody go here as I feel they are scam artists and only in it for themselves and getting what they need.\n\nWhile we were there initially  \""the chopper\"" was there. He wasn't personable to the people inside and I think it is hilarious that people would go there to buy a vehicle  just because of him."
2,"I like that you don't have to go through the casino to get here because they have 2 entrances.. Yard House is on my list of places I frequent for only Happy Hour but not their regular menu.. haha their regular dinner menu is a bit over priced for a bar with average food but it doesn't matter because I only come for HH~!!! I've been here on several occasions for Happy Hour, late night Happy Hour, on the cusp of Happy Hour lol \n\nThings that I enjoy:\n-Chicken Lettuce Wraps- or you can get them with mushrooms instead of chicken mmm\n-Hawaiian Poke Stack- watch out sometimes the tuna is not that fresh though lol\n-Spinach Cheese Dip- so bad for you but so good\n-Chicken Nachos- quantity over quality.. huge portion; great for sharing\n-Pizzas- pretty tasty \n-Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat - tastes like Fruity Pebbles\n-Light Lemon Drop Martini- low cal; tasty; strong\n-Spinach & mushroom salad appetizer portion (not on HH) but it's delicious and cheap!\n\nService has always been friendly and fast. One time my boyfriend and I barely made it for the last seating and the server wasn't rude and didn't rush us! Even though this Yard House is located inside Red Rock Casino it is not owned by them so they don't accept any of the mailer coupons from the hotel~ \n\n\n\nHOT TIP: Happy Hour:  Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm \n                                      Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close\n                                      Last Seating: 30 minutes prior to close"
1,"In case you were wondering whatever happened to Mervyns... \n\nWell Kohls has been around for many a year now and there happens to be one in my living vicinity. It's one of the few clothing store in my area in a shopping center with a Target. Kohls sends me mail all. the. time. How they got my information is beyond me, but I've been on the tail end of a \""I don't have any money left in my bank account\"" kind of month. BTW - if you've ever wondered how much it sucks to pay for grad school out-of-pocket, well, it sucks a lot.\n\nI have a banquet I am going to in honor of one of my professors from college and I really wanted to get a new dress and jewelry. Unfortunately I have very little money right now. I decided, what the hell, I will check out Kohls and just see if they have something I can afford. \n\nTo begin with the store itself is fine. There's really nothing wrong with it save for some things being a tad messy. To me it looks as though they are understaffed, hence the reason for the messiness. They had a sparse amount of employees working when I was there. No one at the registers. No one in the jewelry department. No one really milling about in the misses clothing either. I was not asked if I needed any help. I browsed and found a dress and went into the fitting rooms. The one I went in still had clothing hanging up in it.\n\nI browsed the jewelry section and found a necklace. Seems as though everything here is either 40% or 50% off or some kind of sale. \n\nLastly when I went up to pay there were two girls and between the two of them it took a few minutes to figure out who was going to ring me up. I ended up being escorted back to the jewelry counter to be rung up for my purchases. The girls were nice enough, just a little disorganized.\n\nOverall I would never shop here on the regular. This was certainly one of those desperate times call for desperate measures types of things."
2,"I had a crave for chinese food today and after reading good reviews about this location I went ahead and placed an order.\n\nI had the combination plate C26 (General Tso Chicken) since some yelpers raved about this dish and to be honest, I liked the sauce but I didn't like it had so much breading I could not even taste the chicken inside (if there was any). The accompaniments were a pork fried rice (that was tasty) and a pork egg roll (same as  most other chinese places) very chewy and a bland flavor. My hubby had the #66 (Kung Bo chicken) and he said there wasn't anything exciting about it. I really don't know if we will order again from this place."
1,"Nice, quiet rooms.  Food in the hotel is abysmal, however, and few vegan options.  To even get soy milk, I have to go to the coffee bar (though one spectacular Blue Coyote employee, Glenna, sent a colleague, Lucy, to said coffee bar for a creamer of soy milk for me this morning -- only time employees made any attempt to engage with me).  Have no idea how this place claims to earn 4 diamonds (must pay AAA for their trainings/bias) because housekeeping was hit or miss (day 1 = trash emptied and amenities replaced. That's it.  Bed unmade, towels not replaced, room not tidied.  Day 2 far better, day 3 I had a fancy diamond-shaped toilet tissue fold... is this my 3rd different housekeeper??) and employees otherwise seemed bothered by guest presence.  Banquet rooms are freezing, casino area is smoky (both to be expected, I guess).  Dinner for 7 in Orange Sky was $530 and I got to eat side dishes only (not even a vegetarian entree on the menu)."
1,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights.. big mistake. the restroom was very small, bed was fine. I did feel like a construction worker. Diddo on what charlene said this stay was over priced I believe I would have been happier at a motel 6. the restaurant was a huge disapointment. I ordered the mussels which came out ok, but my $30 filet was over cooked and had zero taste, it literally tasted as if they just threw it on the grill and forgot to turn it. I sent that back and got the bacon chedder burger, could you believe they still asked me how I wanted it cooked. yes it came out over cooked again. I went back to the room and ordered out."
3,This place is nice. Its not too expensive and they carry lots of variety.  I used the 15% off yelp offer and paid $8for 2 smoothies. I ordered the berry oat and hated the splenda taste. They promptly and happily made me a different one and I loved it. I only order that one now. Its the health nut-but I sub out the protein for yougart.
2,"Good BUT ... good is abundant in Montreal. Garde-Manger is not consistently among top recommendations in Montreal but it makes the list often enough to form some expectations. My expectations exceeded Garde-Manger's delivery in terms of both food and overall experience. \n\nThis is another of what I call the \""Chalkboard Bistros\"", fine dining establishments that provide the menu via a large chalkboard on the wall in the center of the restaurant. I don't like this practice but it's popular (for now anyway). I found the menu, limited and lacking distinction / personality, with the same style of offerings that are standards around Montreal. That being said, the food was good, it just didn't deliver on the level that I would have expected given the buzz about the place. \n\nTIP; request the front bar if bar is given as an option. The back bar can become almost another kitchen-like operation preparing oysters and volume drinks. Back bar can also be pretty tight. \nTIP: avoid being seated during one of the eating sessions times 6:30 / 9:00pm, the wait-staff can get slammed during these seating sessions and your service delayed and/or intermittent."
4,I almost always stay at excalibur when I go to Vegas. I went this last Thursday and had booked a room for $22.00 a night (with my MLIFE rewards) when we got there to check in they upgraded us to a suite for free. I have NEVER stayed in a suite before so it was soooo nice and pretty. I loved it! There is so much food to choose from from all price ranges. This is actually my favorite place to play slots even tho I often walk to the other casinos. I am never disappointed with this casino.
4,"First, I heart the hostess (cute, nice, proper)!  When we got inside, we hung out at the bar while they got  our table ready.  I like to be consistent, not only because I order what I like, but it helps me to compare places fairly.  I got my usual Tanq gimlet and some drinks for my friends, and was wondering why it was taking a bit longer than usual seeing as we were the only ones at the bar.  I still dont know why, but when I got my drink, it was THE BEST, BY FAR gimlet I have ever had.  I couldnt stop talking about it or thinking about it (lush?).  Whatever they added or did, it was more balanced and sweeter.\n\nWhen we were sat the real fun continued.  I ordered the NY since its what I always get and it happened to also be the most expensive item (46), along with a side of asparagus.  The bread they brought out for us while they prepared our entrees was good, typical nice restaurant good.  \n\nThen the entrees came...\n\nIf you took an audio-only recording of our table, it could easily be mistaken for a 5 person porno.  We were all very impressed!  I ordered my steak MR and it was perfect.  The steak wasnt overly dressed, they let to quality of the meat do the most talking.  The asparagus was soft while still retaining the nice crispness you'd expect.  By the end of it, not only did we have a great steak, but we were full!!  I had abandoned the asparagus to ensure that I finished the steak even.\n\nAll in all, an absolutely flawless experience.  Server was perfect, charismatic, informative, attentive without being a nuisance.  We will definitely be back!"
3,"This place is amazing! They have fresh made food and huge portions. Their bread is some of the best I've ever had. My husband and I have been to Kneaders twice now, this location and the one in Yuma and it does not disappoint! We split the turkey, bacon and avacado on foccaccia bread because it's so much food. Their sweet breads are phenomenal as well. We will definitely return!"
2,"With all the hype and media that Great Bao has been getting lately, I had to check it out. My foodie senses were tingling when I heard of a hole-in-the-wall (literally) place that specializes in steamed bao sandwiches. You'll have to walk through a hair salon to get to it though!\n\nI am a huge fan of the most delicious fluffy bao buns. Whether they be Cha Siu Bao stuffed with delicious BBQ pork, some savory Peking duck, or a delicious variety of sauteed vegetables--I'll eat it!\n\nI chatted a bit with Jenny and Chef Sheridan--a couple of the nicest people I've met in a while. I ordered their \""combo meal\"" of sorts: your choice of any 3 bao + any drink for $10. I opted for 1 beef, 1 pork belly, 1 duck + peach italian soda. The beef bao was my least favorite. The beef was flavorful but in comparison to the size of the bao bun, I felt it ended up being a bit bland. The duck was meaty and had just the slightest bit of crispy skin. GO FOR THE PORK BELLY! The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth good. Flavor was awesome. Texture was awesome. And it was the perfect pair with the fresh bao.\n\nI'll be back for another Pork Belly Bao and to try the rest of their menu. They've got smoothies, salads, and some noodles I hear are pretty awesome. \n\nSupport local Las Vegas owned businesses! Visit Great Bao."
0,"I even took the time to write this over it was so bad.\nOrdered the fajitas on waitresses recommendation.\nWorst piece of meat I have ever been served - and I loved in the dorms!\nChef should have caught this - there was just something wrong with it.\nI never send food back - relying on the restaurant to provide edible food- they failed. \nI will go bck and, shoudl I get another piece of meat like this, I will personally walk it back to the chef and make him/her eat it.\nYuck - cannot wait to stop belching that \""meal\"" up."
0,"One day I received a menu that was left outside my apartment door so I took a chance and ordered delivery for the first time and was extremely pleased by the quality and the taste of the food so I continued to order on several different occasions until one night, I was told (in a very rude manner) that they would be changing the route soon and would no longer be delivering to my address. About a week later, I called instead of placing my order online to see if they were still delivering to my area and was pleased to hear that they would still be delivering to my address so I happily placed my order over the phone. When the delivery arrived, the same driver from the previous encounter rolled his eyes when he realized that it was me and was rude but I did not engage him. I ordered two more times after this incident over a two month span and my food was delivered by different people who were very courteous, I even offered one of them water because it was so hot out but he refused. It was the most recent experience that will keep me from EVER ordering from this place again. The same guy from previous negative experiences made the delivery this time and as he was swiping my card, he began sighing and rolling his eyes. As he tore the copy of my receipt he waved it in my face and told said \""I'm not gonna tell you again, we will not deliver here anymore!\"" When I advised him that I had called on a previous occasion to confirm this and was told otherwise, he held up my receipt and boldly stated \""No one wants to come here for THIS!\"" and handed me my receipt. I took the receipt, said thank you and closed my door. It's unfortunate that because of this one delivery person, I will no longer be ordering from here again..."
2,"Got a great deal on hotwire, for three days, around $20 a day.  You have to take a shuttle from the airport to the car rental.  You walk to the second island outside of baggage claim, the buses run quite frequently, were there 3 lined up to pick people up when I arrived at 11:30am on a Friday.  The ride only took 5-10 minutes.  \nThe rental facility is huge and nicely air conditioned.  When I walked up to the Hertz rental, there must have been 30 people ahead of me, around 5 sales people and took around 45 minutes before I was helped.  In fact, I was pulled from the line to follow an attendent downstairs, where there were 3 sales people to help ring us up.  \nGot upgraded to a compact with a GPS since they ran out of subcompact.  Loved the GPS during the stay, I want one  at home now.   The car is a little dirtier then other rental places, the carpets had stains and the outside had some marks on the paint but I still would take the GPS over those aesthetics.\nFinding the car was easy, in numerical order and all was covered.  When I dropped off the car, was easy, you just need to remember which bus to take you to which terminal, I believe there are 4 seperate terminals."
0,I'm from New York and take Cab rides everyday. Never have I been so annoyed at the rude behavior from a taxi cab driver before. I along with My family was told that our destination of three miles was too short and a waste of money for the company. The fare was 15 dollars so be the judge. Taxi driver 5698
0,Arrived this Friday at 3:00pm. Check in took over an hour! Had private dinner party at Carlos and charlies for 60 family members. Came in for reservation to not have anywhere to sit. Our party was all separated then told we could not be accommodated for drinks because there was only one assigned waitress. The whole dinner was paid weeks in advance. Horrible service and rude waitress.  We then met a man who worked here that offers us 20$ unlimited drink bracelet which he told us they get paid for every one they give out. We then came in to after dinner club with 20 people and paid our 20$ fees.5 minutes later we were told we had to leave (no refunds) because they claim one person who walked in with our group caused a scene 2 days ago which didn't happen. So we payed thousands of dollars and got treated like total shit. Will never come here again. Worst vegas hotel service I've ever seen.
1,"9/18\n\n98 South is open for business again!  When did this happen?\n\nA friend and I stopped in for a drink and checked out the band and two singers for a bit.  I really liked the female singer- she had lovely strong vocals and danced energetically along to the song.  I only heard her sing once, and her other partner sang to the style of Frank Sinatra, my friend's favorite, for the rest of the time we were there.  \n\nI decided to try the mojito, while my friend ordered a Miller Light.  The bartender, with big blonde hair and a very ample, um, countenance, handed me my drink after a few minutes and had to ask what my pal was having again.  While she retrieved his bottle from the fridge, I tried the mojito.  I wished I hadn't.  It was VERY HEAVY on the mint syrup.  I'm used to drinks made w/ muddled fresh mint, but if she had used a light hand on the syrup, I probably wouldn't have minded.  I had asked if she'd re-do the drink, and she said \""sure,\"" but not w/out showing her dissatisfaction.  She returned w/ two glasses- the revised drink and leftovers from the original, should I \""want to have more alcohol.\""  As she handed him his beer, he gave her his credit card, to which she SHOUTED back a \""What do you want to do with this!?\""  He was so taken aback, he had repeated the question and almost retorted back an apt response, but decided against it, just to help speed the transaction along.  \n\nI'm just glad that my companion enjoyed the jazz accompaniment, bec. I felt so bad he had to pay $12 for that terrible mojito drink, which he had me abandon after taking a photo of it.  Lesson learned: Just like with food menu selections, I should find out how they prepare their drinks.  (I really did think that a nice place like this wouldn't cut corners and use such saccharin-sweet syrups...)\n---\n10/16\n\nJust received an email from \""Iolanda\"" who wanted to clarify that \na.)  98 South only serves Bud Light.  Our bad.  My friend did order a Miller Lite, but did have to settle with a Bud light.\nb.)  98 South does not use mint syrup- only fresh mint and simple syrup.  Whatever they used, it was very heavy with too-sweet syrup.  So bad was the experience for my friend that he swears never to try another mojito again.  Not even one made by yours truly- ask the people I served at a party months ago... I can make a decent mojito!\nc.)  She swears her credit card statement went \""What do you want me to do with this?  Go shopping?\""  Sorry, sweetie, but my friend and I both disagree.  In the end, my friend paid $12 for a lousy drink I had to abandon, and you still received a tip, bec. my friend is still a gentleman.  \nd.)  Our bartender's name is Iolanda."
4,"I just had the BEST donut from Urban Cookies. It was so delicious I just can't get over it! I took a but and it just melted in my mouth, so good. The customer service was good as well. What impressed me the most was that a little boy came in (maybe 14 or 15 years old) to buy a bottle of water (it was much needed, today was 110 degrees). The guy behind the counter asked him if he was walking or taking the bus, and the kid said he was taking the bus. The guy gave him a free bottle of water. He said it was for anyone who walks or takes the bus. I love it, support being green. It was wonderful. I still can't get over that donut. It says on the bag they use local and organic ingredients, which I love. I try to avoid GMO as much as I can."
0,"The food is bland, they LIE about the posted specials, the managers NEVER return phone calls and are magically NEVER in the office when you're attempting to reach them, and the so-called \""MANAGERS\"" are very unprofessional. I've personally witnessed the FAT one in the white coat yell at employees in the front of the restaurant. LIKE, WHAT? At least take them to the back office if you're going to throw a bitch fit."
1,Eh...   Good variety of wing sauces/rubs.  But it was average.  Plenty of tvs to watch football but they are very awkwardly mounted so you have to crane your neck to see more than 1 game.
3,Great BIG BAR! Best burger in Scottsdale yet! 4$ mini pitchers!
0,"If I could, I would give this place zero stars! The food was not bad but if you like to be treated rudely and enjoy crappy service then this is a place for you! Right when we were seated my husband wanted to get up and leave but we were in a large group so out of respect for everyone else who was hungry in our group we stayed."
2,"Very nice and new hotel.  It is a bit away from the strip, so either bring a good pair of walking shoes, or extra money for cab fare. However, being a little distance from the strip can be a good thing, because it's quiet.  For the price, I would stay there again."
3,"Salut is in an entirely unassuming part of Tempe, but it's a happy surprise! Once inside this little restaurant in a newer strip mall, it's a delightful eatery filled with character and personality. Once inside, you'd never know what was around you on the outside. The atmosphere is intimate and charming with dark wooden and metal features, dining table spread throughout the restaurant and a large bar taking up a lot of the space. They also have a small patio that is dog friendly!\n\nFirst off, the happy hour here is amazing. They do $5 bottles of house wine and you don't even have to open it there. You could just simply take it home with you! \n\nI recently dined here before seeing a show at ASU Gammage and found it to be a perfect restaurant before a show. It's just east of Rural on University but only about a 5-7 minute drive to the theater. My friend and I shared the bruschetta and the corn and goat cheese salad. You get to choose four bruschettas for $12 and each one is cut into two. The salad was on the smaller side. After eating the meal, I think we could have gotten one more item to share in order to leave completely full, but the food was excellent! I think I could have easily enjoyed the order of bruschetta to myself. We got four different kinds: Chicken & Hummus, Wild Mushroom, Fig, and Prosciutto with Apple. I really enjoyed all three but my two favorites were the Fig and Proscuitto. The bread was very soft and delicious. \n\nThe salad was flavorful complete with corn, goat cheese, chicken and avocado. It was a delicious salad but I wouldn't suggest splitting it if you're really hungry. Save it for yourself! \n\nThe food, environment and price was all very delightful and I will definitely return again for another visit!"
2,"Had a chance to check out Lancasters last week from some BBQ take-out. Have driven past this place for years and never stopped in. Located on Beatties Ford just north of Mount Holly-Huntersville Road, it's easy to miss. There's a restaurant side and a bar side, which is where the take out area is. Very friendly staff. Ordered the chicken/pork combo and it was decent. Nothing wowed me about it, but it was pretty good. The mac & cheese side was really good though and I'd recommend that. Good place for a quick lunch and I can see why this is a 5pm place for many workers. Pork was better than the chicken, so if I go again, I'll probably just go with the pork platter."
2,"Not my favorite hotel on the strip.  I've stayed here a couple of times and the hotel definitely is in need of renovation.  They've modernized a section of the hotel with Hipper linens and decor, but the room is still the same.  Old.  But since it's comped, I can't really complain.  How much time does a person spend in their room in Vegas anyways?!\n\nGambling here has been hit and miss.  There are times when I've had a blast (aka winning money) and other times where I wish I never hit the casino in the first place!  But I do like the dealers and crowd here for the most part.  I wish the casino served grey goose since a lot of other casinos do and I play the same min on the tables, but for a couple of drinks, Flamingo will do.  If fully comped, I'd stay and gamble here again!"
3,"I recommend a visit for two. Order one thing from each part of the menu: Start, Smaller Plates, For Sharing, Finish. We did just that and had an unexpected and delicious experience. We shared everything. The dishes came out one after another and not one disappointed in flavor or aesthetic. We found drinks to compliment the meal. Our service was excellent."
3,"I'm not drinking the kool-aid on this place just yet.  It was easy to get a reservation on a Sunday. The prices are reasonable.  The service was good.  Attentive servers.  I had the steak bernaise.  I never hand a bernaise sauce, so the lemony buttery flavor really surprised me and I enjoyed it.  The sirloin meat was a bit chewy, but it's thin and if you cut small pieces, you don't need to work it too hard.  They serve a boat load of fries.  I guess for the price, we got a good meal.  I'm just not sold that it's a 4 star times 2000 yelpers.  Dessert was meh.  The apple tartin was nothing we expected.  We've seen many that have the apple slices fanned out making a lot of texture. This one was just one big slice of apple baked with the puff pastry on top.  I will say the food was 3 stars and the good service gives it another star."
3,"Oh my goodness what is that magnified yet terrifying tuning noise that continuously rang throughout the weekend from 4am to 6am in the morning?!?!! My goodness!!\n\nBut besides thats, the Veer Towers is great! Three full bedrooms, three full bathrooms, and everything was so sleek modern, I loved the wide open space windows that not only gave us the view of Marquee Day Club, but the Bellagio water show and Paris' Eiffel Tower, making it a one spectacular view.  We had a flat on the 27th floor which was a rented flat to guests. I will note that I was a little taken back that a blow dryer was no where to be found, simply because, well, any rented flat or a hotel I've stayed at provided that particular vanity amenity. Thank goodness that I did pack one in hand ahead of time, otherwise! I loved that the kitchen was large and spacious, and I was even surprised there had a Bodrum french coffee press, a true plus!\n\nThe Veer Towers is located in the City Center next to the Aria and Cosmopolitan. As I had mentioned above regarding the eerie tuning nose, apparently, the Veer Towers is known for this misfortune and just wasn't constructed correctly. The tuning is caused by the high winds that blow through the towers next to the other hotels, but The Veer seemed to get hit the most with the strenuous tune.\n\nBut I kid you not regarding that loud tuning noise, I was seriously terrified that evening and I felt like we had UFO's around us, that's how intense it was.\n\nHowever, besides the noisy ruckus, I loved it, and would love to stay here again, just hopefully under a much windless weekend x"
3,"Gumbo is just perfect, makes a jazz musician smile! We got the $45.00 price Fix menu, lots of choices the BBQ shrimp is bursting with flavor inviting the diner to indulge once bite after bite. I you are not allergic to shellfish and you don't order this I recommend that your wife kick you! It is that good' The peach chicken crispy(no breading!) and juicy with savory bread pudding (think Yorkshire pudding) with oyster mushrooms! Wonderful ! The trademark Banana creme pie did not disappoint! Recommend you ask for the seating facing the kitchen bar style -- you can chat with the culinary artist while the cook your meal!"
3,The club was really spacious. You didn't feel like you were confined to two areas. It was fun dancing on the water.
2,"I just don't get the hype.\n\nI guess I never had a butter burger before, and I've from the midwest.  I had never heard of this place before.  I didn't think the frozen custard was anything great either.  My hamburger was fine.  Nothing special.  Maybe I'll have to go again to see if I change my mind.  Everyone seems to love this place!"
3,"I fell in L-O-V-E with this shop the moment I walked in.  The layout, the decor, and the smells were captivating.  I had a wonderful sales associate who showed me to the sink and let me experience the magic of the scrub.  I chose the French Vanilla scent and I regret not buying the lotion too.  Fortunately, I have friends in Las Vegas who are willing to shop and ship for me."
1,"Another comp dinner and this time I was sober enough to remember that indeed, we did not eat that much. (I know, what do you expect from a complimentary dinner, right?!) eh =/\n\nWe were provided a salad which had an oil dressing that I was not loving, not a balsamic dressing, just an oil.  And rare steak over rice which was just okay.  Drinks were still on point and service was still great.  Still looking forward to going back for an actual dinner to provide more details but isn't their comp \""tastings\"" supposed to entice you to come back??  Well, based on that theory, I may not return. =("
1,"I would not have found the place if I didn't read the reviews.  Its an outdoor seating area that is next to the entrance to Monti's across from the park.  Even as we approached I wasn't sure, then realized their shirts say Tempe's Front Porch.\n\nSo I think they're trying to be a hip young place.  Its a great spot for people watching for sure.  The food's not terrible, but also nothing to write home about.\n\nWe got the fries - sweet and regular which was nice.  It came with 3 sauces that were all every sweet...  Not a huge fan of them.  I ended up using the sauce from the chorizo stuffed dates (bbq).  The fries were crisp though and not too greasy or salty.\n\nThe short rib tacos were ok, the meat was slightly on the dry side.  Can use a little more than shredded lettuce on top.\n\nThe chicken lollipops were just pieces of grilled chicken with Red Hot on it.  Not impressed at all.\n\nThe yukon potato dish was terrible.  Its a slice of deep fried potato (think extra thick kettle chip) with shredded meat/chorizo(?) on top with some sour cream and a slice of raw jalapeno on top of it all.  Raw.  Poor plan, poor execution - zero points for this dish.\n\nThe chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon was actually pretty good, also hard to mess up.  Had bbq sauce on it.  \n\nEverything came with a splash of red pepper flakes and parsley on top.  \n\nIts a neat little spot to hang out in, but I have to agree with the others that the service is on the slow side.  We almost had a 1:1 server to customer ratio and it was still slow so I can only imagine.  The service was friendly and willing - just very slow.  The food is NOT very impressive.  I think an above average home cook would easily come up with better dishes than these.  Happy hour deals aren't great either because the portion size is very small.  If anything it's priced right.  I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon."
1,"Wonderful.\n\nWith this experience, I left both Vegas and Trump hating them more than before entering them. Entering the city and the the Trump hotel, not the city and the old pig with a comb over, that is.\n\nGot a $159 deal on Hotwire (i.e. not knowing it would be Trump). I was at least expecting Trump in Las Vegas to be as tacky, tasteless and obnoxious as the old fucker is in the rest of the world. Unfortunately, Mr. T. always gets it wrong. \n\nThis place is unassuming, uninteresting and doesn't live up to the expectation of a 5-star hotel.\n\n- Ultra minimum staff: 20 minute wait for valet parking, 1 or 2 at the check-in and check-out counters (with a huge line), passive room cleaning service\n- Clunky bathroom (noisy doors, no waste basket, weird lighting) with minimum amenities\n- Stained iron board\n- Extra Wi-Fi charge\n- Weird bed frame about 20% bigger than the bed (very comfy bed)"
0,"I am so upset and disappointed with Chipotle across from Sunset Station on Sunset Road. At 1:45pm 6/24/12, a husky latino young man, gave me the WORST service ever! I ordered a bowl with vegetables and steak, of which they apparently were running out. I get a significantly smaller portion than what I usually get at your restaurant. When I asked for more veggies to supplement the lack of both steak and veggies, the attendant said we are out; I said I would wait; he throws the plate away with an attitude and a dirty look, with no intention of giving me what I asked for. I had to spend my money at Spicy Pickle to get the food and service I deserve"
0,"I had to give 1 start because I couldn't give a ZERO. This place is a scam. Breezy has poor customer service she'll hang up on you and show you no respect. I bought a groupon through her and booked the appointment in advance she waited for it to pass didn't call me or text me at all not even \""As she was waiting and waiting for two hours\"" and now wants to charge me DOUBLE (as in $97) to make an appointment. Do not waste your time!"
0,I just walked out after waiting upfront for 5 minutes with no one coming upfront to serve me. The girls were giggling in the back and even walked towards the soda machine to try and get in their line if site. There are plenty of other places to eat if you don't want my business.
2,"Sought this place out because it was across the street from my hotel, but was pleasantly surprised by the service and tasty entree.  I'm not a fish person by nature, but after a long day of tasting cheese I wanted a relatively light dinner and ordered their halibut - served over flavorful mashed potatoes with an awesome creamy (but not heavy!) sauce.  The fish was tender, flaky and moist, really nicely done.  \n\nThe goat cheesecake dessert was a lovely cheesecake, but unfortunately drowning in a far too sweet cherry sauce.  I wondered if this was to smother the goat cheese flavor in the dessert - but if someone doesn't like goat cheese, maybe they just shouldn't order the GOAT cheesecake?  \n\nThe wine was lovely although it cost twice as much as the one I thought we had ordered... either myself or the server was not watching my companion closely enough when he ordered it!"
3,"Just under .40 Cents per wing, Tues-Thursadays with a drink! wow what a deal.\n\nA nice excuse to hang out with friends to enjoy great finger food.  I also like the different layouts of the many locations.  I'm not a big yelper of chains but heres another one that is worth the typing.  \n\nThese guys also claim that they were the first to bring Award winning Buffalo wings to Arizona, the website states it, so it must be true.\n\nEnjoy, \nKevin"
1,"I want to give the Cornish Pasty Company another star, but I can't quite do it...\n\nThe pasties I order are REALLY good... They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid.\n\nI tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the \""premium\"" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me. \n\nEven that, I can write off to personal preference.\n\nWhat really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself. \n\nIt's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back. \n\nOn the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made. \n\nI don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses). \n\nMy worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the \""kitchen\"" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites...\n\nI've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back.\n\nMaybe I'll just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden..."
2,"I would have given 5 stars, based on the food, decor, ambiance and service. However, they really messed up at the end. Their credit card machine was having a problem processing my discover card. We kept waiting and waiting and waiting. Then, they convinced me to try another card, which was not working either, so clearly the problem was from them, not me, However, the waiter persuaded me to call my bank, and check. I was placed on hold, and my bank replied that there are no problems with my card. It took forever for us to leave this place. FOREVER, as in 45 minutes, I ve had wine, a good meal, Im ready to gamble and I felt like I was taken hostage in this nice restaurant. Im sorry, but at one point, you gotta give up, the customer comes first. Finally, I was told by the manager that the card went through but that they wont be able to issue a receipt that I could sign, so I felt kinda bad thinking, does that mean no tip for my waiter ? I told the manager that I had no cash and wanted to give a tip to the waiter , manager said not  to worry. I am pretty sure my waiter never got a tip. The whole experience left a bitter-sweet taste in my mouth. I would have expected a credit, a discount, a little something to apologize . Anyways, not sure if I ll be back."
2,"Was recommended tp me to try by a co-worker.  Had a \""eh\"" experience.\n\nAn \""eh\"" experience is what you say when recommending the establishment to someone else.  And that sums up my experience.\n\nService had a rocky start...my friend started a tab before I got there and I sat for 15 min waiting for a server before I went to the bar.  Five minutes later a different server came over and had taken over our tab.  So problem solved.\n\nWe had a couple of the 1/2 price apps.  They were good - calamari and potato skins.  Pretty standard stuff.  \n\nOverall, I'll go back for some HH specials but I'm not going to be the one suggesting it to people.  I'll stay up by 16th and Bethany Home instead."
2,"We had $50 of Food & Beverage credit to kill at the Vdara and Market Cafe was one of the few choices.  My tuna melt was delicious and my bf's egg, cheese, and bacon bagel was not.  These items took 35 minutes to come out of the kitchen, which is pretty ridiculous.  We also ordered some tea, coffee, juice, and desserts to hit our $50 mark.  Apparently pre-packaged items (like salami, ice cream, or canned beverages) do not count."
0,"This was my first and only visit to the Brooklyn bowl. I loved the ambiance of the business but the bowling is what ruined my night. When there's a live concert there's a $100 minimum fee for the bowling which is so dumb. Then we waited until the concert was over so we only had to pay $25/per half hour (still not worth it) and they add food and drinks onto the one bill and charge for everything. Socks. Food. And unless you're playing they won't let you in so they wouldn't let our friends in. Most expensive bowling game I've ever had. $390 without tip. Also the service at the Lanes was slow. My friend asked the server what beers were on draft and he replied, \""it's on the menu.\"" Simply, they weren't friendly and over charged for everything! Never again Brooklyn bowl."
3,My wife and I really enjoy going to this Carvel + Schlotsky's restaurant.  They have really delicious sourdough crust pizzas (I love the BBQ-Chicken & Jalape\u00f1o) and tasty ice-cream treats.   Free-wifi and cold raspberry lemonade help make it a great place to go.
3,This place is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. The Panang curry is so good (even my husband who is not a fan of curry loves it)! And their Tom Kha Kai is amazing. Other favorites are the fried rice and Pad See Ew with beef. \n\nThe service is prompt and friendly.
2,Very dirty place.\nThe bussers stroll around with big smelly carts with food leftovers between the tables to collect dirty dishes. DISGUSTING!! \n\nThe food was OK but not great.\nThey had crab legs.
0,"This place is soooo off and on to me.  Is the food amazing??  yes, there is no denying that the food and drink of this resturant is amazing!  However the service always leaves something to be desired EVERY SINGLE TIME I come to the Paradise location.  For instance this past week i met up with some girlfriends to have drinks and tapas and my friend had to ask for her drink three different times and litterally 20 minutes later her diet coke showed up AFTER our sangria and mojitos had been on the table for like ten minutes.  I had to practically beg our waiter to give us any attention and to take our order.  The busser had more interaction with our table than our waiter.."
1,"I went to wild Thaiger for dinner with three friends and although the service was good in a clean environment, the food was disappointing. The flavors and preparation is just not authentic. I am reviewing the food with the background of having traveled to Thailand and having lived most of my life in larger culturally diverse cities (NY, Chicago, DC) with close authentic thai food. Here are some critiques:\n\nPad Kee Mao - My favorite noodle dish of all time is supposed to be prepared with thick rice noodles sauteed to a variety of textures, and infused with a dizzying array of spice. Instead, the dish here is made with thin vermacilli noodles and tasted like a lump of wet ricey dough. I even explicitly asked for it to be extra spicy, but there was barely any.\n\nPad thai - This basic Thai staple was presented as a soggy clump of noodles with a watery sauce pooling at the bottom of the plate. The worse part was that despite all of that sauce, it was tasteless except for the peanuts sprinkled on top. There was no hint of tamarind or fish sauce or chili. Disgrace.\n\nTom Yum (chicken) - Again, what we received was a flavorless broth. There was no taste of lemongrass, no curry, and the chicken was dry.\n\nNeedless to say, this was very disappointing. For a large restaurant in a prominent location, the food served up here was worse than some of the shacks I've eaten out of in other cities.\n\nTwo stars for service and cleanliness alone, none for food."
4,"This gal came into my shop referred by someone else ad was one of the most quality referrals to date.  I own an artisans boutique in old town Scottsdale and we host workshops in the arena of arts and social interests . . . . Teresa taught some workshops to moms on infant massage.  Soon after that I decided to personally get a massage from her bc she mentioned that she does ah-shiatsu massage and I had never had a massage like that before.  I loved it!  I've been back! She is really strong, and careful at the same time.  Her studio is clean and peaceful and she is very knowledgeable about the body.  I have referred her to friends and plan on going back again. She is professional yet seems like someone you have known for years. Love that I found something new to enjoy!"
4,"The negative reviews here slay me. This is the best Irish you're going to find in Phoenix. My wife IS English. She really knows English and Irish. She'd give this place 10 stars if she could. I would too. For authentic, consistent and well prepared food, give it a try. You won't be disappointed.\n\nP.S. We've been there so many times I've lost count. Service is ALWAYS good."
2,"Out of all the breakfast places to enjoy in Pittsburgh this one stands right in the middle. I love that it is in Regent square and that they have sidewalk seating so you can have breakfast in the sun whilst people watching, NICE!\n\nAs far as the food goes it is just so so for me. I like my sides when it comes to my first morning meal and they come up short in that department. Last time I went it was our annual St Paddy's parade day. My \""mai\""  (thats what I call my mommy) had the square breakfast, I had the breakfast burrito, and J had the breakfast quesadilla. I just could not decide! I wanted something different but I was worried I wouldn't like what I ordered and I needed something filling that particular bar crawl day.\n\nI really wanted to try the Smoked salmon Napoleon but if the fish wasn't good it would ruin the meal and I wasn't willing to experiment. My burrito was OK, nothing outstanding. It could have used some re-fried black beans, spanish rice for a side of something?? See my pics for the plain presentation. I did like the chicken apple sausage.\n\n I tried some of the vegan chorizo that my mom had gotten with the Square BF. I liked it but it did have that fake meaty flavor underneath the spicy chorizo sauce. Again pretty ho hum, I wasn't even that interested to try J's quesadilla because the ingredients were the same in my burrito. The atmosphere is perfect to start the day and service is decent. I don't know... it's just missing some pizzazz for me. After some thought I think that because of my mexican upbringing and cooking skills I search for a more authentic flavor but in reality this is American breakfast! I'll def be back! In closing maybe I have to be in an adventuresome breakfast mode, try something new, and not be such a square."
1,"This place is always packed. Why? Am I missing something? Someone please tell me! I have only been for Breakfast and it's moderate at best. That morning I had scrambled eggs which I truly believe were a week old, turkey bacon which was grossly undercooked and pancakes which were light, fluffy and very tasty.\n\nThe service was good. Our waiter was a little shy, probably his first gig but still very nice, polite and attentive.\n\nThe opinion at the table was the pancakes ruled and everything else was unacceptable. With that said, I honestly can't see myself frequenting this place often just for pancakes. I need more to choose from. That's why I ask you to please tell me what I'm missing. Why do so many people frequent this place? Is there a secret menu I don't know about? Am I visiting at the wrong time? What? Tell me!"
1,"Everything about the new Pete's is great, but the food is just good.    Please bring back Pete's recipes.   The services is good now, the to-go containers are great,  but bring back Pete's recipes.  The rich flavors in the sauces in the Basil stir fry or Egg Plant dishes are gone. \n\nWhen I ate there right after the first of the year, the taste was there,  but every time I have been back the food is getting more and more blain.  Stop changing the recipes and go back to what worked.\n\nI maybe a little rough here but Pete's was so good,  now it's avg."
3,"Great beers on tap - Four Peaks and Oak Creek among them.  8th St. Ale - I heart you.  The place was playing mid-90s Radiohead and Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid.  That in itself is pure genius. \n\nLiked the beer barrels showcased through a window.  The outdoor deck looks like it will be a real hit when it gets a bit warmer.   Nice cozy feel, warm avocado walls and kick-ass vintage chandeliers that I want to go back and snag!  The highlight of the decor though, is the oddly curious Being John Malkovich doorway up above on your way to the restroom. \n\nMy Chicago buddy with me was unimpressed - but I'm sure places like this are a dime a dozen there.  This place rocks.  It's the downtown bar we've all been waiting for.\n\nEDIT, 9/07 - Dave B is right on about the same music being played every night.  I always hear the same exact songs by Radiohead and Coldplay every time I go to Roosevelt.  WEAK!!!"
1,"We arrived here on a Saturday night after making a reservation and still had to wait 1/2 hour for our table. When we finally did sit, there were empty tables everywhere. \n\nThe waitress introduced herself and then left for 10 minutes without taking a drink order. I ordered a hot and sour soup with the lobster entree. The soup was great, but the lobster was just ok. Definitely not worth $40.\n\nThey forgot a few of our orders and took literally 15 minutes to run the credit card. I definitely won't be returning"
2,"Tried out the happy hour  with a few friends and they do have some really great happy hour specials! \n\nI don't know if the sushi was mediocre in comparison or if the bathrooms were really so great ...but the bathrooms were my favorite part of Geisha. Who doesn't like smart toilets that open and shut for you (no more kicking the lid up with my shoe) and the seat is even heated! Just like the heated seats in my car. There was a whole panel on the wall for more advanced options, which I did not explore but appreciated the possibilities ;) \n\nEating sushi at Geisha is like eating sushi in an Austin Powers movie. Shag carpet, low couches, very retro feeling. \n\nNot the best sushi or the best drinks but for the happy hour special prices its very worth checking out!  (or just to use the bathrooms)  :)"
0,"This store is VERY dirty, wayyyy too busy, only 3 lanes open on a Monday afternoon with about 15 people in each line. Even the Target Greatland across the freeway had more lanes open with 5, and they arent even a SuperTarget with grocery like this hell-hole is!You can't park because EVERYONE just walks right in front of you and the stupid employees decide right in front of the main entrance door is where they want to bitch about people that shop and spend their money to support their job. I don't think I'm ever going to Hell-Mart again, I'll save my self trouble AND money by purchasing my groceries at Target and Fresh & Easy."
3,Went yesterday with a girlfriend... got 4 different cupcakes.  Yummy!  I highly recommend the chocolate marshmallow :)
4,"We tried Bachi Burger long before Triple DDD showed up in Las Vegas to ruin our hidden gem.  By ruin, I mean spread the word and make us wait for tables because of the crowds.  This last trip to Bachi was amazing despite the fact Vegas was going thru a major heatwave and the AC could not cool the restaurant properly.\nSalad was fresh, fries were amazing, burger and bun were fresh and delicious.  The crabcake burger was decent but I wouldnt recommend a crabcake burger at a \""burger\"" joint.  Staff was slightly overwhelmed because their computers crashed and they had to run cards by hand for people not paying cash but all were friendly and communicated the challenges to their customers.  Hopefully they expand to create more space and less of a wait.  Anyone who visits needs to order the Myiagi (sp?) burger.  Insanely fabulous."
4,"The more time I spend in Glendale, the more I appreciate its many delightful hole-in-the-wall places. Bangkok Thai is all that I could ask for in a neighborhood Thai restaurant. I shared a Tom Yum soup and green chicken curry with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. Next time I'll try the massaman curry--a Thai friend recommends it highly."
1,"Thought we'd give Bluewater another shot for sushi. Bad idea, I guess. \n\nLong story short, we wanted to eat lightly and ordered a few vegetable rolls.They weren't on the menu (they used to be, at $4 a roll) so I spoke with the sushi chef (not one of the usuals I see there) and asked him to be creative in whipping something up for us. We were served three boring, small (4 pieces including ends) rolls that were severely lacking in creativity or excitement. \n\nBill comes and we're charged for spicy tuna rolls at $8 a pop. Whaaaa? First, we didn't eat spicy tuna. We're told that's what they charge for vegetable rolls because they're not on the menu. Okay...but again, we didn't order spicy tuna, in fact we ordered the very opposite. And $8 a roll means we would pay $2 per PIECE of vegetable sushi. No way, man. \n\nIt was only after haggling with our server and two managers that we were able to have our bill reduced to a more appropriate price. Unfortunately, the whole experience sealed the deal on being totally over the place. \n\nAnd so begins the search for a new sushi joint... if anyone has suggestions for killer sushi (that includes creative rolls), I'm all ears!"
0,"Hmmmm.... Think I Would Rather Suck Down Your Colonoscopy Bag?\n\nIf you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.\n\nWow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.\n\nJust 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.\n\nSo we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....\n\nOrders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.\n\nChicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.\n\nBBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.\n \nThe food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.\n\nGo grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place. If you do decide to go, don't forget to bring your business card - it might be old enough to go up on the wall in 2032 - that is, assuming this place is around much longer."
4,"We went on a sunrise expedition and the whether was a bit chilly.  It was a clear skies with perfect weather condition.  \n\nThe meetup point is located in Deer Valley Airport parking lot.  This is your first and last stop to use the restroom if you have to go.  You're required to check in and he/she tells you which van you belong to. Once you're in the van, the people in the van with you are basically the people you'll be riding the hot air balloon with.  \n\nOur driver was super funny and nice.  Before we left Deer Valley Airport, he gave us a short background history how hot air balloon had started.  As he reached closer to the hot air balloon destination, he gave us a brief instructions what to do and what not to do.  \n\nOur Captain Bill was hiliarious and very nice.  The view of Phoenix was amazing.  We were so awe and wow by the view so high above.  At one point, we descended down and cruised along the way as Bill described the different types of catus that can be found in AZ.  We saw Jack Rabbits running around through the desert.... and off we went back high above.  \n\nAfter the ride, we were served with breakfast and champagne.  It was a nice touch to end the expedition.  \n\nI would highly recommend this company to anyone who's thinking of taking a Hot Air balloon ride when visiting Phoenix.  \n\nWe had a wonderful time.  Thank you Hot Air Expeditions!!!"
2,"I have had things tailored and dry cleaned here. Dry cleaning is fast and cheap, but everything smells like old people when they are done. \n\nThe tailoring was cheap, but one of the stitches fell out after about a week :(\n\nI've had better, but not really cheaper."
0,"Excellent aged steaks 5 stars, good service, wine selection pretty lame unless you want to spend hundreds and hundreds. BUT the crab salad was the cheapest POS salad ever, minus 5.  I stopped at one point and asked myself if it was some cheep caned watery tuna, about two tablespoons for $30.. If this place is in the top ten restaurants in Vegas as advertised, they should shut the town down and quit. Pitiful just pitiful, and the side of asparagus was much better.  If you want a complete dinner, skip this joint!"
4,Some of the best pizza I have found since moving out to Las Vegas
1,"These type of chain places are noy my jam- It was OK- they do have some pretty awesome Happy Hour Specials on drinks and food- that being said, i would come back, but only for those deals and only with girlfriends for dinner and drinks during HH- otherwise, you are getting crap."
2,"As a beginning rock climber, I don't have much to compare it to. I thought it was a fun experience that I would definitely do again. The equipment was durable and safe and after watching a demonstration video, they personally showed you how to use it appropriately.\nHowever, as soon as I walked in the door, I wasn't impressed with the unwelcoming staff. All 4 of the employees that I interacted with were not very personable. As a new climber, I appreciated any support and help if I was doing something wrong. Instead of handling the situation in a way that expressed support, they made you feel like an idiot. \nWhile I would probably go back because it's close to my house and I enjoyed rock climbing, I'd rather drive a further distance for friendlier people that want to encourage you."
2,"Had some calamari tempura and a couple sushi rolls. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly memorable either. All of the staff was extremely pleasant."
3,Excellent.  It has indian food (good for vegetarians). They make a salad in front of u whixh is good cuz they can properly toss it
1,Nice atmosphere but food was average at best. Took the sever 20 minutes to bring coffee. When she finally did it was with milk that curdled...i had the western omelette that left much to be desired. Great place to people watch but consider eating elsewhere if you're looking for good service.
4,"Si Seor is the best Mexican food Chandler has to offer, from what I've tried.  The vegetarian combination is the best!  They offer quite a few combination platters to choose from, or you can get a plate of just your favorites.  I bring all of my out-of-town visitors to this restaurant, pushing the sangria and combinations to all who dine with me.  Their horchata is also quite tasty, and it's a nice compliment to the dishes with the red sauce.  The sopapilla is a perfect ending, and I'm happy to report that they also include them with take-out orders.  Very good value for your money!"
3,"I arrived very early to pick up my daughters, so I went in for a beer.\n\nI had a Negra Modelo, and after a bit, felt hungry.\n\nTheir prices are a bit extreme for just a snack, but the fresh-made guacamole sounded delicious, and was reasonably priced.\n\nThey prepare it table-side, and the anticipation of watching it being prepared makes it taste better. (True story)\n\nIt had large chunks of avocado, jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lemon juice, and is topped with pomegranate seeds.\n\nOne of the most amazing guacamoles I've ever had, and I have had, and made dozens of recipes.\n\nI may have to head to the location outside the airport, and try one of their entrees.\n\nIf I spend any significant amount of time in the airport again, I'll certainly hit this spot again!"
4,"Sorbet with an alcohol content? YUP.\n\nI had no idea this existed prior to Arsenal. Since our first visit a few months ago, we have become regulars, and its due to both the absolutely fantastic ciders and sorbets, and Michelle's friendliness and hospitality. \n\nI'm a fan of the sweet, but not so into the dry, so I can't tell you much if you're into that. But, if you are a sweet-lover like myself, here are my top picks: raspberry, grape, blueberry, amber, catawba, honeysuckle, and the delightful 'Santa' (cinnamon apple). The only caveat of Arsenal is that the ABV is higher than most, and this stuff goes down sooo smooth... It's way too easy to drink an entire growler all by yourself!\n\nOh, one more warning that will hopefully prevent others from doing what I did: After you've finished your growler, you will undoubtedly want more. Wash it out, let it dry upside down in a dish rack, then put the lid back on it, and close it. I didn't close the lid once, and my bf just took the bottle back to Arsenal and got it refilled. I came home, took a swig right outta the growler, and it tasted a little.. off. Then, he poured it into a cup, and guess what? I'd just drank a bunch of fruit flies. Are you gagging? I sure did. \n\nOkay, now forget that you read this last paragraph, and go get some delicious cider and sorbet!"
4,I rescued a pup the end of September and started coming here after a friend had suggested I use them. When you walk in it doesn't smell which is a plus to me since my old vet smelt terrible. They are super friendly and genuinely care about your animals! After Lexi and I had gone on our first visit they called to check in with me and see how everything was going. My sister and I decided to bring our cat Hula there also and they have helped us get him back on track too after we noticed significant weight-loss and excessive shedding turns out to be a thyroid problem and they have helped us regulate his meds. I think they are very reasonably priced too. You should definately bring your pets here Dr. White is very good!!
0,Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience.
4,"Traveling with a coworker who lives more locally, I am super glad I fessed up to being a snob about eating at chain restaurants.  I turned down Subway and broke out my Yelp app!  Zookz was nearby and had good ratings so we checked it out.\n\nWhat a different idea.  It reminds me of Uncrustables in the freezer section of the grocery store but with much more adult and better fillings.  \n\nI walked in and saw a picture of the #13 which is poached egg, feta, spinach, tomato.  I didn't even look any further..this looked amazing.  And it was!  I wish I could have tried more!  I do think my coworker could have eaten more but they did have some side options available.  The sandwich was less than $5, I believe.  All options appeared $7 and less.  They also have Coke products...I'm a sucker for a fountain diet Coke.\n\nThe service was really friendly with someone greeting us immediately, taking our order promptly, and even asking how our meal was and how we heard of Zookz!\n\nMy only desire is that they open one in Dallas or Plano, Texas!  (:"
4,"A \""5\"" for the Dosa, Lassi's, and the service!  On a separate occasion we took in-laws (from India) for the lunch buffet; they said it was the best they've had in a long time.  I would love to see them offer a Chinese Dosa or Genie Dosa!"
2,"I had been frequenting another North Shore location for years but I thought I would give Rivertowne a try and it was good. I had the baked Italian sub and it was tasty, cold beer, intimate space, nice views, plenty of TV's, all good. The service could be faster and more personable and cleanliness could be better but all-in-all a pleasant experience and I will be back."
4,"This restaurant is about as good as it gets, at least in the city of Pittsburgh. \n\nFirstly, the ambiance is low-key, fairly classy, and romantic. My then-girlfriend and I were seated in a room with a table of people that were a bit too loud at times, but I don't blame Legume for that. Our service was attentive, fairly friendly, and knowledgeable. \n\nI love that this restaurant is farm-to-table, and that is really evident in the wholesome, fresh ingredients. I love the fact that their menu changes each day. \n\nIt has been a while, but I recall that we ordered goat cheese and apricot jelly crostinis and some kind of salad to start. Both were complex and very, very delicious. While I don't usually like hard boiled eggs or anchovies, I had to eat them, because every flavor had a place in the salad, and they all came together and complimented each other perfectly. \n\nThis was also true for our entrees.. I believe we both had some kind of chicken dish, and I ordered a side of their french fries with a truffle aioli (again, absolutely incredible). Just when I thought it couldn't get much better, we ordered desserts. I recall having ordered some kind of raspberry and cream dish, and it was light and wonderfully tasty. The presentation of every single dish was impeccable.  \n\nWhen all was said and done, $130 or so including tip was more than worth our experience. \n\nIf you're looking for a high quality dining experience in Pittsburgh, look no further. This is simply one of Pittsburgh's best."
3,"$30 for adults even though the sign outside says $21.99. This price also includes bottomless mimosas. The line is never long and you pay through a machine to get in.\n\nThe best items in the meat section were the prime rib, bacon, and bacon bits. The best desert item was carrot cake. Don't get anything red velvet-flavored. The best breakfast item was egg florentine that gushes with butter."
0,"I had shopped around for a boarding facility for my dog. Found this place, went in for a tour loved it, it was clean and people very nice! I made the appointment for drop off signed all papers needed-- VERIFIED my drop off date 3 times because it was Memorial Day. The morning of the drop off I called numerous times with no answer, went over there sign said CLOSED!! We had a trip plan to leave in 3 hrs an in a last moment I had to find care for my dog THANK GOODNESS for Petsmart doggie hotel!! I left messages with each phone call an never got a response?! So seriously is there people there with the pets?! Petsmart was AHHHMAZING an guess what EVERYTIME I called someone answered an they didn't leave me hanging!!"
3,"The search is over, I have found taco heaven. I sampled a chicken, asada, and pork street taco. The pork was a little sweet and smokey, the asada was well seasoned and smoky and the chicken too was a winner, just not as a flavorful. My husband let me taste the Bombero burrito, OMG, was that Mexican barbecue sauce on the burrito? The dining experience was well worth the 30 minute drive. I would sample everything on the menu. Thanks for the suggestion Bill B."
4,Dharma Lounge is the perfect size venue with a very loungy feel which is refreshing in Charlotte over saturated market.
2,"The pool closes too early...don't worry, just climb over the fence. The internet connection sucks, don't worry, just use a sniffer program to hack into it. The front desk people are rude and don't care...don't worry, just bring up basic business economics, they'll yield. The ownership doesn't care...don't worry, they'll be out of business in a year. I'm writing this while staying in room # 232 ON December 18th, 2014."

0,"Pho Kim Long....more like Pho Kim Wrong.\n\nHORRIBLE, RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, DISRESPECTFUL \""MANAGER\"" \n\nI was just at this establishment (at approx. 2:30am) and it was just appalling. I have been here a couple times before and I wasn't expecting such horrible \""management\"" skills from their \""manager\"". The service staff wasn't so bad. Throughout the meal our cups were filled and they made sure everything was up to par. Everything was running smoothly up until the bill arrived. I was in a party of 4 and we needed a split check. We went up to the register to pay and it took a while for anyone on staff to assist us. Once we ask for a split check one server gave us a dumbfounded look and walked away from the register. Then another man went to the register and flat out said \""We don't do split checks.\"" \n\n*Sidenote*\nI have been here before around the same time and they were able to do a split check without any hassle. \n\nI told the guy that they were able to fulfill the request last time but he said, \""Thats impossible, not without my approval\"". He was very rude and when I was explaining this to him he was practically ignoring me and a my group while he was counting money from another party. Flat out ridiculous. He also charged my friend our whole check before we were told we couldn't split it and faked a void. \n\nNO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE FOR FOOD ON THE STRIP LATE AT NIGHT YOU'RE SERIOUSLY BETTER OFF AT SOME GREASY DRIVE THRU THAN PHO KIM LONG."
1,"My first time there last weekend and let's just say it wasn't the best first experience.  I placed my order and it took quite awhile to get it.  Then we got our food and my order was completely wrong.  By the time they made another and brought it out everyone else was done with their food and I had to get mine to go.  The waitress took the check off the table, I was assuming they were going to give some sort of discount being as I had to take my breakfast to go now, but nope, she came back and there was no offer or mention of my inconvenience.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food I did get to eat was good, but I won't be going back.  If a restaurant screws up and you miss enjoying your meal with your table, they needed to offer something for the inconvenience."
1,"I've been twice now.  Both times the food quality was just average.  I dock an additional star for being overpriced.\n\nThe basil crispy chicken just didn't work for me.  Maybe it's their execution, but the \""flash frying\"" of the basil just creates a bitter flavor that ruins the dish.\n\nThe pad thai was very average.  I know it's not an adventurous thai dish, but I had a hankering for it and was disappointed that it wasn't better.\n\nI do like the atmosphere, and the service was solid.  I liked Phuket, a beer I don't remember having had before.\n\nThe tables on the sidewalk are dog-friendly."
0,"I'm very sure that I will never purchase from this company ever again. The following is not the only issue with my purchase, however it is the most pressing. It's been a month since my return of a mattress that was never even delivered to my home, and they have had unknown problem after problem processing my return which has stalled the return of my money.\n\nFirst the Ahwatukee Store Manager stopped taking my calls, Mike was great when I was purcahsing but had Clare speak to me whenever I followed up on my return,  claiming that corporate was processing it. Then when I called the customer service line, the guy brought me to tears. Between having no information on a month old return, claiming that a Tempur-Pedic base has no warranty, and refusing to let me speak to a manager, I felt completely de-humanized and powerless. As if I would never again see my [significant amount] of money.\n\nAfter harnessing my Google-fuu, I found corporate accounts payable who admitted my return had never even been addressed (over a month later), let alone processed, and she would bring it to a manager and I'd receive a call in 24hrs. No call. I just spoke with them, only to find out still nothing has been done. \n\nThe only things I can do is call, and start speaking up about this unprofessional treatment.. I feel completely powerless while they sit on my money, the Store Manager has his commission, and I have nothing. But if this continues I will have to look into further, and more serious, appropriate legal action. \n\nHow do you file a collections claim on a corporation?"
0,"No, no, no, no no!!!\n\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again"
1,Gluten-free crust was underdone and not very tasty. :(
1,"Came here this past weekend for dinner to celebrate the our friends' wedding.  The only thing saving me from giving this place 1 star is the view of the strip (that comes around every 15-20 mins or so) which is actually very pretty.\n\nThe food, on the other hand, is nothing at all spectacular considering the prices that  you pay.  My husband & I shared the lobster mashed potatoes & to be absolutely honest, it looked like mashed potatoes topped with vomit & it didn't taste all that great either.  The rack of lamb that I had tasted gamey & the port reduction that came with it was actually kind of hard for me to stomach.  My husband had the salmon & that looked like something I throw together when I don't feel like making dinner.  Yeah, not worth the $40 price tag.  I could get the same size piece of fish for $5 & make it taste 100x better.\n\nBest thing of the night?  The mojito I had & the Grey Goose screwdriver my husband had.  Can't ever go wrong with the booze =]"
3,"I grew up eating Chico's Tacos (I'm not old, lol), and it's definitely one of my favorite quick Mexican food joints. The salsa bar is fantastic. I suggest the beans (no lard!), shredded beef tacos, the Achiote Chicken Salad (yum!), the cheese enchiladas....\n\nI need to add though, Management changed last year and they sadly adopted flashy, in-your-face menu boards and jacked their prices a bit. No bueno. I haven't been much since it changed but it's still good."
4,I love this place! I've been coming me for a few years now. They treat you like family here!
2,"The atmosphere of the restaurant was great.  I have to agree with some of the other posts that it seemed that we were an inconvenience to the waiter and took a long time between ordering and getting our food.  We were there a total of 3 hours,  and most of that was waiting.  The food was Ok. I had the spare rib.  It was a little dry and the portion was a bit small for the price. The best part of the meal was the bread pudding dessert, it was fantastic.  Overall,  it was not a bad place,  but not sure I would return with choices that taste better for less money."
0,"My wife ate at noodle and co. In Colorado and she raved about for a few days. So I noticed someone said this place was like it so I thought hey let's give it a try. It was terrible!! I got the pesto chicken, wife got a veggie dish, and we got our daughter regular Mac and cheese. When we got the food is was so hot!! I mean unbearable hot. So after waiting a few minutes I tasted and it was undercooked noodles and a weird taste. I never leave food that I just purchased but this was BAD!!! An awkward worker came by and asked how it was and I told her \""this is terrible!\"" I don't think she new how to react to this. She said I can take it back. I told her, really this dish was $8. If I was at a sit down restaurant then I would of had her take it back in a heartbeat, so I felt bad about trying to get my money back or another dish. I ended up eating half of my daughter's Mac and cheese. So just to sum up don't go to this place with high expectations. I was very disappointed!!"
0,"Open till 11 pm? came at 9:30 they couldn't do my acrylic fill because two people were in front of me?! 'We don't have any openings, sorry' Are you kidding?"
4,Best fast food burritos in town. Pancheros doesn't touch this place. Adobe is a close second. Go with the Barbacoa.
2,"The restaurant is a nice-looking, with a pretty well-furnished and clean, if a bit crowded, set-up. This is probably what I liked best about the place. The food is reasonably good too, although maybe a little on the oily, chewy side; the cold cuts are really good, the soup was questionable, and the duck was so-so. \nI'm very particular about the house tea, and they had great tea here, so plus points for that!\n\nThe service is lukewarm at best. I didn't feel very comfortable as a guest here, since I like to have even just a bit of interaction with the servers, at the very least a greeting...\n\nMy family seems to like it, so I'll probably be back again to see if my discomfort goes away, but only when I get dragged over after a visit to 168, probably."
4,"Chef Xavier is a wonderful ambassador to the world of raw food.  The food is tasty, fresh and delicious.  He recommends going to the cafe website to look at the menu, and calling ahead to place your order, so that it can be ready for you upon arrival.  Or, if you pop in on the spur of the moment, you can select something fresh from the deli case.  For those who want help improving the nutrition in their diet, he offers a smoothie program.  He makes a delicious smoothie called \""The Works\"" that contains many different vegetables but tastes absolutely delicious and refreshing."
0,"I usually have great experiences at Big Five stores. This was my first time in this particular store. We had our 2 year old with us. After walking around the store for about a half an hour I was just about to purchase a punching bag when my daughter, who is potty training, said she needed to use the restroom. It is obvious that they do not have a public restroom but my wife asked anyway if our daughter could use a restroom. The associate said no because of company policy. What! I turned and clarified by restating that the company would not allow a 2 YEAR OLD use the restroom and again he said no and did not even bother to get a manager. So we immediately left the store without a purchase. \n\nAfter we left I called the store to speak to the manager on duty about the situation. Same response. Actually, he said it was policy because of shoplifters. Great people skills. Long story short, I may visit a Big Five in the distant future but NOT this one. \n\nMANAGEMENT-- teach your associates and managers to use discretion in their decision making process. Sure, someone MAY attempt to steal something, but you DEFINITELY lost a customer. BTW the vast majority of shoplifters will not ask a sales associate to escort them to the bathroom as the fact is that the item would need to already be concealed so why bother."
4,"I wasn't crazy about Marquee due to my last experience, but the last few times I've went changed that.\n\nThe first time since that original review, I don't remember much only that it wasn't bad. We came for Gareth Emery but ended up leaving early because members of our group couldn't hack it.\n\nThe second time, I came for day club. They had a \""Halfway to EDC\"" pool party they threw. It was super hard to get into so we arrived early. We stood in a huge line and eventually got in. \nEverything was awesome, though super crowded. Dash Berlin rocked the house and I remember being impressed by the setup of the place more than I had been last two times i had been there. \nI also ordered some crazy nachos which were delicious but I couldn't eat very much of because I was still hung over. I still drank though, and had no problems with that. We met some amazing people and had had a great time. I'm very happy I dragged my boyfriend to it and decided to give Marquee another try.\n\nMy third time, last weekend, everything was perfect. The atmosphere was spectacular, and ATB made us dance until we got blisters on the bottoms of our feet. (Which are still killing me, but so worth it.) The setup of the place impresses me more each time I go there, I sware. I just notice more great things about it.\n\nOh and it helps that we never had to walk up those crazy high staircases again. That only happened that first time. Now they have a bunch of very operable elevators to get us to the needed floors.\n\nI love Marquee now. They just blew it the first time I came, but they've certainly redeemed themselves.\n\nOh and make sure to hit up Brian T. at Marquee https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uaFOvyGPRvSETSS6Lk8-5A any time you're heading to Vegas and need gust list entry. He's awesome, and covers your entrance into all clubs, not just Marquee."

2,"2nd time eating here and just as good as the first.  Lunch menu has affordable eats at various prices. The bread basket, which seems weird at a Asian fusion place, was standard but do try the toasted bread slices with cinnamon which slip to the bottom.  The tempura is light and tasty, Cajun shrimp pasta is to die for, Pad Thai comes with a plate full of noodles and veggies.  Service is slow because of the crowds.  Had to ask for more water and it took more than a moment to receive the bill.  A bit overpriced for noodles yet still good.  I would not make a special trip to visit."

0,They didn't have an option for forever 21 but I have to say the manager is very rough around the edges no customer service and has no business working in Summerlin she should be on the eastside of town.  I went in today Nov 16th to do an exchange for a dress I ordered online but I couldn't find anything I liked. I let them know that it was online ordering and she yelled at me for no reason saying TAKE IT BACK AND MAIL IT OFF YOURSELF OR GET A GIFT CARD. I couldn't believe she did that in front of everyone to show she's boss. I came in the store in a great mood until tha b%\u00d7\u00f7= chimed in the conversation i had with an employee not even arguing. I will never come back to that classy looking place with trashy fowl mouth managers at forever 21
1,"We (8 friends) have been coming to this restaurant for several years during our annual Vegas trip. The service and food are always great. Not anymore. We reserved a specific table 3 months in advance. When we got to the maitre 10 mins before reservation time he said he would not seat us until the whole party was here and by the way \""you need to be aware that we need to sell the table again so don't take too long\"". Incredible. He would not sit 4 of us (the rest were shopping for a few minutes) AND he had the gall to tell us to hurry up once we sat. This at a place that typically sets us back at least $150 per person. So our table sat empty while the rest of the party arrived (15 mins). Of course we had told the maitre that if he sat us before the rest arrived we would start drinking and eating. He still refused. When he finally sat us, I politely thanked him and asked his name. His answer? \""What is YOUR name?\""  I gave it him and he just looked at me, refused to say anything and left. This is truly apalling service for any price level. Clearly these guys feel like their full house (and mostly tourists) justifies them giving unacceptably bad service. Spend your money somewhere else, where they will actually appreciate it.\n\nPost-meal update: The stone crab legs were ok and the King crab was amazing. Mac and cheese always great and two people said they would come back just for the banana cream pie. Our server, JJ, was funny, nice and professional. As usual, after countless crabs legs and bottles of a really nice white, we paid ~$150 per person and would be well worth it except for the maitre'd interaction, which really soured us on the place (I upped it to two stars because of JJ and the great food). The owner has contacted me, which is always a good sign of managers actually caring."
1,Formerly Pharoah's Pheast.  Definately spacious dining area.  But the food was just OK.
1,This place wasn't bad...worked to get our group inside without paying for cover...music was decent...a lil too much britney at times but when your drunk you dance to whatever crap the dj plays\ndrinks were pricey like anywhere else on the strip\nMinus one star because the bouncers can kiss my ass..how do you kick out someone for looking at somebody else 'wrong' and say we were trying to start something when we PAID to sit down at a table and not let me close my tab at the bar?
0,"If I could give zero stars, I would: what is this place? A haven for craft-brew enthusiasts? A wanna-be bistro? Animal shelter activist headquarters? I don't bloody get it.\n1.) it took the waitress 20 minutes to shove two tables together to accommodate our party of 8 (4 adults and 4 small kids.) The restaurant wasn't busy, but the staff spent so much time drinking with the patrons they couldn't be bothered to do the necessary shoving. \n2.) the waitress took order, disappeared to drink and chat at the bar, came back about 40 mins later with food.\n3.) hubby ordered a burger, no complaints. Elder kiddo ordered fish and chips, and proceeded to eat only the fries (thin cut fast food fries, not \""chips\"".) The fish was slightly undercooked and overly greasy-- not sure how that was accomplished. It was served with what was supposed to be slaw, but was just red cabbage in an oily dressing. My kid never turns her nose up at any fish, but she didn't even touch it. \nI ordered the brats and mashed potatoes to share with my youngest kiddo-- the fresh veggie saut\u00e9 was excellent and the mashed potatoes with bacon were fantastic...at least the few bites that weren't drowned in an unpleasant, bitter onion-and-beer-based reduction. The brats were also doused in the powerfully bitter gravy, but no matter, since they were undercooked as well. A nice steak should be pink in the middle, a sausage should not be. Ick. I'd have complained to the waitress but she never reappeared....\n3.) ... In fact she hadn't come back by the time I left with the kids and my hubby stayed with my friend's hubby to try the horchata-orange beer the pub was unveiling that night. Who knows when she wandered back. \n4.) live music too loud at 6 pm.\n5.) hubby said that after my friend and I left with our respective kids, our table sat un-bussed for at least an hour. Some drink guy came up and asked if he could finish off my daughter's uneaten (and still uncleared away) plate of cold fish and chips, then helped himself... The horror. \n\nThis place made me think of where 40-ish post-hipsters go to drink away their remaining youth... Alcohol probably kills the salmonella from all the undercooked food, after all."
1,"Ate there for Valentine's dinner.  Too expensive.  Portions very tiny.  No bread.  Salad was tasty enough but consisted of about two tablespoons of mixed Greek salad.---I'm not kidding.\n\n  My dish was salmon.  The fish was cold and the sauce was congealing.  Had to send it back for reheat.  My Valentine's was sword fish, which consisted of about 3 one inch square pieces. Also cold. \nNo bread, no Pita bread.  The sword fish was about $24, and the salmon, about that much, too.  The wine list was all Greek wine, and the glasses the wine was served in were like little toy glasses, not real wine glasses.  Our waiter was kind of lackadaisical.  \nThere were food splatters on the white wall next to the table.\n\nWhen a short woman made rounds about the tables to ask how we liked our food, we didn't  trust ourselves to even get started, and mumbled, \""thank you.\""  All the \""Best of Phoenix\"" favorable reviews were at least 10- 20 years old.\nThe bathroom had toilet paper stuck to the wet floor of one stall, and the toilet installed inches from the side wall in the other stall.  Weird.  There was a table with chairs outside the bathroom, like they seated overflow guests there.  Weird.\nWe vowed never to go back, and remembered maybe that's why we hadn't been there for years.  Better to eat at Crazy Jim's or Greek Town. \nSave your money."
3,"This is probably my favorite hotel I've stayed at in Vegas. I've stayed at at more than 10 different hotels in Vegas and I always enjoy my stay here. I have the M Life card so I've gotten comps and discounted rooms from here and other MGM owned hotels. (If you stay At any of these hotels I highly recommend getting this card.) The rooms here are huge and the staff is very nice. The beach setting at the pool and wave pool are awesome, especially when it's 104 degrees outside. My favorite restaurant here is the Burger Bar! The Kobe burger is great! \n\nThere are 2 minor things I don't like about this hotel, which knocks it down to 4 stars. 1) This hotel has become more of a family oriented hotel over the past 2 years. That's not a bad thing but it's not what I'm looking for in Vegas. 2)The TVs are old and not HD, at least in the rooms I've stayed in."
3,"Chance encounter on this little (well, maybe not soo little) gem of a place. Yelped it the moment I passed by it because of all the cars present in their parking lot. Although there are only 8 reviews for the place, what people had to say about it really made me want to visit. \n\nWas well greeted on a spontaneous adventure to the restaurant for dinner. The bar was packed so my party decided to get seated in the main dining area. Got seated right away and was introduced to our server in no time. Think she had to swallow a chill pill or something because it took some time for her to be nice (most likely the main reason im not giving this place 5 stars)\n\nThe menu was pretty reasonable. Starters dont exceed $10 and entrees range anywhere from $5-$15 (If Im correct, there is only one item on the menu costing $15) \n\nWe started off with three appetizers, thinking it would be the only dishes ordered (little did we know):\n\n- Grilled Spicy Chicken Wings: Some a little burnt but it tasted great. The portions are large and seasoning just right (or too bland depending on what you prefer). I liked that it was grilled, less of that greasy hell overwhelming the taste of the actual meat.\n\n- Homemade lemon garlic Hummus with pita : sooo delicious. It was only about $6, it comes with a bunch of pita. My party of 4 shared it and still had left overs =] definitely recommended.\n\n- Cheeseburger Sliders x3 on Egg Bun: The bun is delicious! and the meat is perfectly cooked (medium) and seasoned. The perfect balance of meat, bun, and cheese. Comes with diced pickles.\n\nWe were having a jolly time when all of a sudden someone notices a dish being served to the the table next to us. It looked so good, she decided to order it herself. We ended up sharing the Half Chicken entree and I was extremely impressed with how it came out.\n\nThe chicken is juicy and tender the entire way through. No parts of the chicken dry, every bite was well savored and just...mmm mmm mm\nCame with two sides (we chose the green beans/onions and mashed potatoes): green beans weren't my favorite, they were overcooked but the mashed potatoes. Perfectly cooked, tasted so fresh. They don't use a ton of butter or sour cream which was favorable to my taste buds. \n\nWould definitely come again\n\nFYI: \nhappy hour 3-6:30 pm. From what I could make out on the menu written in chalk: Half off appetizers and three 5.5 oz of draft beer for $5 (normally $6 for 3 - 5 oz beer sampler) oh and something about $5 wine"
4,"Whenever I talk about Madison to someone out of town, they always say \""I hear there is a great Farmer's Market\""\n\nRight they are.  There are few like it.\n\nTake the entire Capital square, and line it with local vendors.  It's quite the experience.\n\nHere's what to expect:  Fresh produce, meats, breads, cheeses, flowers, and more all produced within a short drive of Madison.  You'll also get samples of many of those items.  \n\nYou are going to pay a lot more for stuff than what you'd pay the grocery store, but the point here is not to save money.  It's to contribute to sustainable farm-to-fork production.  You're typically getting organic, free range, well-cared for food.   You'll find many items far tastier than what you'd find at the store as well.\n\nPro tip:  Get there before 9AM or else you'll face massive crowds.  Also, leave the dogs at home, as they are not allowed."
4,"Everyone was very pleasant today.  I love shopping here they really take care of you.  I broke my bottle of of Chanel Coco Mademoiselle and they actually replaced it for me.  Amazing!  I started a page on facebook about it https://www.facebook.com/BestChanelPerfume \""Like\"" us!"
4,Called around and no one could beat this places offer. Quick service and phone looks like brand new. Will go again if I have too (hope I don't have to). They have my business going forward with my products. Thanks and keep it up.
4,"Great value and very relaxing. I have been half a dozen times over the last month and had the hour reflexology massage each time. Has always been one of 2 lady therapists (Ivy and a younger lady) - they are very thorough, hard working and seem to know what they are doing.  This is a slightly different style of massage from say Massage Envy -  you start off reclining in a chair / bed and you are massaged with your clothes on (I go along in a loose t-shirt and shorts - which makes it all a little easier). They dip your feet in some colored liquid (herbal tea?) to start with legs arms etc, are massaged while you are reclining in the chair - then you are turned over and receive more traditional massage while you lay on your tum. Most times I have been able to turn up without an appointment, but now I'm callling ahead incase they get too busy."
3,I've been wanting to stop by here before work for weeks and I finally had the chance this past week and it was definitely worth it! They currently have a $1.50 deal for a doughnut and a cup of coffee; the perfect way to start your Friday. Their pastries and doughnuts are delicious! Absolutely stop by if you get the chance.
4,"Un-Real best BBQ, very good!"
1,"would you like some wine with this cheeeeze!!!!!  i suppose the kiddos would love watching a free, pseudo pirate show, but why would you bring kids to sin city to begin with?!?!\n\nit's so kitschy and vegas strip cliche you have to check it out just for pure novelty's sake..."
4,Eli and his crew are great. They take great care in making my yard look the way I want it. and Eli follows up after every visit to make sure I'm happy and get feedback. I highly recommend them.
2,"The fries are really good.  The turkey sandwich was creative and big, but the processed turkey slices didn't quite cut it, whatever they use for the bun was way too small, and they didn't mix enough dried cranberries with the mayo.  It was good and filling, but nothing to write home about."
4,"it's my fifth visit to wonderful Pittsburgh and the city never fails to impress me. \n\nUrban Cottage is a shoppe with great gifts for nearly any budget. I loved some of the paintings on the reclaimed wood. \n\nWhether you're looking for a housewarming gift, birthday gift or a \""just because\"" gift, you really can't beat this place if you're in PGH! We need one of these in CLEVELAND!! :)"
2,"There are lots of choices here for a make your own noodle box. And the portion they give you is large, no one in our party could finish their box. The extras, peanuts, lime wedges, cilantro, etc. all cost extra so be wary of how many boxes you're ticking. You might end up with a much more expensive lunch than you had planned. \n\nFor a quick place that serves OK Asian food go here. Especially if you like being in control of everything that goes into your meal. Otherwise, head up the street to Chinatown."
0,"Thank you, for treating me like a criminal.\n\nOnce upon a time, I purchased a beautiful pair of Cole Haan boots from here.  OK, it was two pairs but who's counting?  However, when I tried to repeat that lucky find on another visit, things went downhill fast.\n\nAfter wandering through and finding nothing worth even trying on, I headed out the door at the same time that a man (who I think works there) with a large box was coming in.  The security alarm went off, but since I didn't touch/linger over/try on/purchase anything I paused briefly then just kept walking.  Mistake.  The woman behind the counter ran out of the store yelling \""you need to come back in here RIGHT NOW!\"".  Ummm... people are staring... I go back inside with her, and she gives me a kind of up-down look and says she has to see the inside of my purse.  I can't hold it open and let her see, she has to take it from me and paw through it on the counter.  Really?  You think I took something?  The outfit I am wearing (grown-up business clothes, by the way) is fitted and does not have pockets and the purse (not one of my usual suitcase-sized bags) is very small.  Where, exactly, did she think I was hiding merchandise?  Did I somehow fit a pair of stilettos in my bra?  WTF!?  Finding nothing, she proceeds to lecture me on the importance of removing the magnetic security tags from inside clothing since they set off her alarm.  Um, I don't have any of those but gee, thanks for the helpful information.  Hmmm... do you think maybe the guy coming in with the box set off your alarm and not me?  \n\nThere are plenty of other places to feed my footwear habit without being completely embarrassed."
4,"Needed a Tux for prom because I'm a last minute guy and this place was perfect! Great, quick service. The guys here take the initiative to get anything you need or anything you want to change. In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger \""I'll be back\"""
0,"Terrible pharmacy! Can't say how many times they have messed up my prescriptions. And even when it's been their fault their answer is \""once it leaves the pharmacy nothing can be done\"" if they just had an ounce of customer service instead of just being flat out rude I wouldn't mind so much. From here on out ill drive the extra 15min to another just so I don't have to deal with them again."
1,"The service at this location was HORRENDOUS.\n\nWas not informed that soda is not included with the meal but milk, tea and coffee are.  So my son ordered a soda which was like $2.50 extra when he would have been happy with the free iced tea.\n\nThe salads came out with almost no dressing on them.  When I asked for more we were charged $.75 per salad for more.\n\nOrdered a kids meal for my 6 year old.  Was brought out a regular sized meal.  When I asked the waitress informed me it was an adult portion.  When I said I wanted a kid meal she took the adult meal back and made us wait about 5 minutes for the kid portion to come back.\n\nHad to ask for drink refills.\n\nWaited forever for the bill and even longer for her to pick the bill up."
2,"3.5 Star\n\nThe storekeeper here at Marie is really friendly, she offered me a sample of some tea while I was browsing the store. \n\nHere you will find good selection of tea and tea wares. And even chocolate that has tea flavour! I ended up picking up a bar of Milk Chocolate with Green Tea & Jasmin from Morocco!\n\nThere is a few tables that you can order a cup of tea to enjoy.\n\nGood for anyone that are into tea or a place to pick up a gift for any tea lovers!"
4,"Allure is awesome! The salon is always clean, the staff is friendly, and their prices are reasonable. I live about 15 miles from Allure, but make the drive there whenever I want my nails done or need a wax because nobody else does as good of a job as Allure. Get your eyebrows waxed by Jen! I've been going to her for 2 years and she's the only person I trust with my brows. She does a great job, keeps them full & natural looking, but cleans them up nicely.\n\nAlso: Bring cash to tip because you can't write in a tip on your credit card receipt!"
0,"I recently moved near this Over Easy location and decided to give it a try. The difference in food and service quality is ridiculous. My good here was barely warm, and the service sucked! My waiters wife and mother-in-law stopped in for breakfast and he sat down and talked with them for a while, leaving all his tables unattended! Horrible experience here, I much prefer the Gilbert location."
1,"Sushi quality is not as good as the picture. Very disappointed. The fish on the sushi is slim and thin. It is worst than other 3 star restaurant,  so I can't believe it got four star."
1,"Interesting place. We sat in the bar at 6:30 on a Sat night and it was pretty empty. It turns into a bar later on and is open until 5 am. We ordered a porterhouse (surfs for free and the shrimp were delicious), brussels sprout side (wonderful and cooked al dente), potatoes au gratin also excellent but the steak wasn't super thick and the Caesar had bland dressing.  The calamari starter was mediocre because of the breading but the spicy marina was very good.  We would go back and try a few appetizers off the happy hour menu $8 but it was fairly expensive considering the quality.  I would opt for a drink at the bar once it gets busy or a quick stop on the way home from the airport so we will return. Be sure and join the online club and you will get a $20 credit to use with your first meal just by providing your phone number when you ask for your bill."
0,This place is horrible! One of the employees crashed my car and rather than having them fix the problem they refuse to answer my call!!  Don't attend the phoenix (7st) location.
3,"One word: Delicious \nTwo words: Great atmosphere \n\nMy Two cents: \nYummy in my tummy! Everyone should check out Amelie's Bakery located in NoDa. It's really more than a bakery and once you check it out you will understand why I say this. \n\n\nIt's almost like hanging out at your cool (but eclectic) aunt's house who likes to whip up tarts, bear claws, breakfast sandwiches and more to tempt your tastebuds. I'm telling you about this place because you can treat it as an experience and swing by anytime to have an almost 9 1/2 weeks (remember that movie...HOT!) moment with a date or pick up treats for an everyday or special occasion. \n\n\nBy now your mouth should be watering. Just remember these delicious items could be picked up at anytime since its open 24 hours a day (winning!!)."
2,"The place is beatiful, the food was ok, nothing spectacular...  The service was SLOW!!!!!  we all got rather irritated over how long it took to get our food, and we all ordered the same thing, the steak and lobster, we must have waited almost 30 min... \n\nI doubt i will be returning."
4,I love grand lux. I never had a item on the menu I didn't like. Came here late late night and they were out of bread. The waitress brought us a order of fries to substitute. Try the cream of chicken soup. You'll thank me for it
2,"Atmosphere pretty good.  Had the fish and chips, good portion and fresh cod. Had an early lunch so I can't comment about the atmosphere during busy time. Give this place a try, great location in downtown Chandler."
1,"There's a lot of hype about this place, and as far as I can tell, a lot of it is undeserved. \n\nMaybe it's just that Phoenix has such a lack of locavore / foodie joints that people are so enthusiastic about its arrival, but the ice cream is decent at best. Definitely better than Coldstone and the like, but compared to the other ice creameries it aspires to, the ice cream is just not there. The flavors are REALLY one-dimensional: everything takes like a sweet cream base with maple / mint / chocolate / whatever else mixed in."
3,"If you're new to the area, visiting from out of town, or even a native, you need to check this place out.  I have gone twice and have left extremely impressed both times.  The atmosphere is so amazing.  Right away, just walking through the courtyard to the main entrance, there's so much beauty to take in.  You'll walk past the courtyard cafe, cantina, bookstore, and gift shop on the way to the main entrance.  Both times I've gone, I did the museum first and then the shops and cafe afterwards.  \n\nThe entire museum is somewhat of a maze and, if you're not on a guided tour, can be pretty confusing to navigate.  We didn't have a tour guide either time -- they're free and on a regular schedule, but we preferred to wander at our own pace.  The first floor is very large and divided up into sections.  There's a lot of baskets, pottery, and katsina dolls to check out, and some really interesting native american history to take in.  I learned a lot about the local and native history.  The first floor (to me) gets boring kind of quickly.  A lot of the collections are not as old or historic as I had expected.  It seems like the younger visitors enjoyed the first level more than I did.\n\nThe most impressive part of the museum for me was the 2nd level.  I was in complete awe of the Indian Boarding School exhibit.  I learned SO much about the Indian Schools that I had never even heard of before.  I really wish they would have taught us about this experience when I was in school.  It was AMAZING.  \n\nOverall, the museum experience was very good.  We learned a lot and really enjoyed the history, art, and culture.  The only thing I don't like about the museum is navigating through it.  They do give you maps and offer guided tours, but it's fairly difficult to navigate if you don't know where you're going.  I don't like to look at maps, I prefer to wander.  Different areas are not very clearly marked.  You'll see a door in a hallway and wonder what it leads to, then walk through and realize you're entering a completely different part of the museum.  It's kind of hard to explain, but I wish the areas were more clearly marked.  It's not really big enough to get lost in, but we definitely had several occurrences where we weren't really sure where we were or where we were headed.\n\nThe 2nd time I visited, we decided to have lunch at the cafe and we were really impressed.  The service was great and the prices were MUCH more reasonable than we had expected.  We figured it would be pricey, but it was not.  I had the smoked salmon quesadilla and it was outstanding.  \n\nThe museum shop is pretty typical from what I've experienced at other museums -- a few knick-knacks that are in my price range, surrounded by ridiculously high priced pieces of art/pottery/dolls/rugs.  It's REALLY neat to look at but I couldn't imagine buying anything other than a magnet or a coffee mug.  Some of the pieces are thousands of dollars, but it's awesome to just look and admire.\n\nOverall, always a great experience, easy to find (there's a light rail stop right out front), and it's also very close to other touristy places if you're visiting and want to experience Phoenix.  I highly recommend this place."
2,"Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine."
4,Go see Heather G! She's cut my hair the last few times and I won't go anywhere else .. She does a. Ice scalp massage and uses good styling products.
0,"R.I.P. Salads N' Such... if you're looking for the Salads N' Such that you used to know and love, this ain't it.\n\nThis used to be a lot of peoples' favorite sandwich shop in Mesa.  New owners recently moved in and unfortunately the only thing that has carried over is the name and a fraction of the menu--most of which tastes nothing like it used to!\n\nFor starters, the service has been really bad.  On my first trip to the newly managed place my order was at first lost, then I was overcharged (which they thankfully fixed, but took almost 5 minutes), and then my sandwich was made incorrectly (a take out, so I got to drive 15 minutes back to correct it, with nothing more than a \""sorry\"" to boot).\n\nOn my most recent trip I got the same thing I had been getting for years and the bread was stale--this from a place that was famous for its fresh toasted rolls--the potato salad was mostly clumps of mayonnaise, the lettuce and tomato were both soggy and aged, and the cookies--which also used to be fresh made--tasted like something from a prepackaged box from the 99 cent store next store.  \n\nI took the sandwich back, no refund needed.  The new owners claim to have attempted to update the restaurant and learn from the \""old guard\"" that was here, but it's a pale reproduction.  They can follow a menu all they want, but if they're using old vegetables and pre-fab baked goods, they'll never come close to what this place used to be.\n\nThis was my last trip to a place my coworkers and I used to love."
0,"Yuck. This was the worst pho I have ever had. Bad broth, ugly meat, wilted veggies. Service was awful. The dude up front was coughing violently, and blowing his nose. Go to Khai Hoan. I feel sick right now and may have food poisoning-\n\n-Update\nI definitely got food poisoning from Pho All Seasons-"
1,"Tasteless burrito. I'm not picky, but the food is not good. The 2nd star is only because the Churro is quite good."
4,"Maybe I gave this one too many stars because nothing compares with Houston's Grand Opera, but the Arizona Opera is still good and definitely worth seeing.\n\nHint:  If you come at 6 pm instead of when it starts at 7 pm you can hear a talk about the opera, which will help you understand it better if you're a newbie!  Cool, huh?\n\nRegardless, you're either going to just love opera or hate it.  I'm a lover = season tickets which includes the price of the parking garage at $8 (compared to $10 at the local garages).  I think the total bill ran $130 or $150.  So worth it if you are one of the opera lovers!"
3,"Great brew pub!  Hoppy beers, friendly service, interesting crowd and atmosphere.  If you are looking for a great beer, go."
1,"Meh is right. I actually liked the dated decor. I did not like the dated staff. \nOur order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table. \nMy mashed potatoes came out of a BOX. Was served cracked glassware. I didnt enjoy my stay at Bally's steakhouse, and unlikely I will be back."
0,"Wow. If you want to buy something here, be prepared to be assaulted if you don't want add-ons. I can't believe the change of attitude in our salesman when we said we didn't need cables, and did not want their warranty. The \""sales manager\"" came over, (who was younger than the salesperson--I'm not buying the \""manager\"" thing) and tried to sell us also. We left without buying anything. When they mention Monster Cable, RUN!"
3,As always a good meal!
0,"If our experience wasn't so bad, it would have made a great skit for late night comedy.  \n\nDrinks: First, we ordered a \""Glass\"" of Cabernet and a \""Glass\"" of Merlot. About 15 minutes later, the over-the-top smiles aloof waitress brings a \""Bottle\"" of Cab and no Merlot. \n\nMeal: It took 50 minutes from placing the order to receive the meal. Other patrons complained to the manager about wait times. When food arrived, we had it bagged in order to make it to next destination.  When we got home, found that the chicken pasta meal did not include pasta, but instead had left over tomato salad and one of the side dishes was not there. \n\nProbably worst of all, the food lacked flavor and there are just too many other superior places to enjoy a great meal."
0,"This was a very sad experience. We went on a Sunday night at about 7pm. The place was empty. It took some time to seat us. Tea took forever. Bread took forever. After 35 minutes waiting for simple food my dear wife got pissed and we left. Because I have honor, I wanted to pay for the tea on the way out. Even that took forever. I hoped that for the prices they charge and the fact that the place was empty that the service would be good. All I learned is why the place was empty. We then went to Cheddars next door and had a nice meal."
2,"Went for the 7:30pm show -  the seating in the back is strange, as you have to spend the show with your body half turned towards the stage.  The Michael Jackson impersonator was awesome, but the rest of the acts were just ok.  The show seemed a bit cheesy, but there were a few moments where each of them were pretty convincing (the girl impersonating Christina Aguilera was super accurate in imitating Aguilera's mannerisms when she kept her hat on).  \""Elvis\"" sounded like Elvis, but didn't really look like him.\n\nIt's an okay show, but I think I'd rather spend a little more money and go see a Cirque show."
1,"This place is hit or miss.  The first time we went on New Year's Eve when it was extremely busy.  They had run out of bread, and were making some other type of bread sticks, which were still fairly tasty.  We also ordered the Bruschetta Romano and they brought out toasted baguettes with a side of marinara sauce.  The when asked about it, the waiter tried to act like he didn't know, but then came back and apologized that it wasn't correct.  I had the Supremo Alfredo which was good, my husband didn't care for his entree too much.  They did have a nice bar selection of beer, wine and well drinks.  We have since been back several times both for take-out and dine-in.  I think it is over-priced for what you get.  I would expect nicer napkins and tables for the price range.  It is more like a cafe type setting, with nicer resaurant prices. Their pizza isn't bad.  We often times will get take-out for pizza.  The last time my husband went to place an order for take-out, there was a lot of people in the front area waiting for seats.  One customer had a child on lying on the take-out counter which totally is unacceptable.  This is where food is being placed for pick-up?  My husband waited for a few minutes and when no one acknowledged his presence or asked the man and his child to move off of the counter, my husband decided we would do Fire House Subs instead.  \nWill we try it again?  Probably... it may be awhile though.  Maybe I will chalk it up to them being a new business and needing to get the kinks worked out."
3,"Thanks to Yelp we found this great little breakfast place while visiting Las Vegas. It's away from the strip, located in the middle of an industrial plaza. \nWe went on a weekday and waited about 15 min to be seated. We were greeted warmly and offered coffee while we waited. The coffee was excellent. When I asked the waitress about it, she said that they grind the beans in house. The food was also very good and the service was outstanding. \nThe ambience wasn't my favorite -think strip mall diner-noisy and crowded. The friendly owner was walking around greeting everyone and told us that they're planning to move to a nearby larger location early next year. \nWe like to support local businesses and will look for Mr. Mamas new location the next time we're in Las Vegas."
2,"I love the Ghost Bar on New Year's, and when I am with a group of friends.  But I am not super fond of it when only in Vegas with my SO.  It is really loud and fairly small.  What I like about it on NYE, is that you can get a table reserved for the price of admission.  On a non-NYE night, it is not worth the bottle fee to hang out in Ghost Bar because it is too loud to talk.  But still, it is more sophisticated and the music doesn't suck as hard as some clubs."
4,"Open 24 hours now! \nGreat tasting & cheap warm sandwiches.\nThis place isn't just a place to go when ur on a budget... it's the place to go cus the sandwiches are THAT good. My first time I found out about this place, I ate here like 4 times in a couple days.\nFull Montagu first. Try the others if you get sick of it.\nThe Hawaiian is really good, too.\nI'd say the only sandwich that I found to be less than great is their classic sandwich.\nThe line gets really long in the peak hours on weekends, but moves pretty quickly; and the service is always pretty friendly and the workers are open to giving suggestions."
3,"I'm definitely a fan of East End Food Co-op.  Their produce is always very fresh and of really high quality-it keeps really well once you get it home too, and while prices are slightly higher than an average grocery store, it's definitely worth it.  My favorite part of the Co-op is the bulk section-- it's a great way to buy items in the exact quanities you need rather than ending up with way more than you want!  The same goes for the spices--such a bargain!  The Juice bar has great smoothies and juices--they're a little pricier than I'm used to, but great for a bit of a splurge!"
4,"Authentic CLEAN Spanish cuisine, good service."
0,"Cute place but what a rip off. $30 for a pedicure and my feet are still extremely dry and the \""massage\"" that cost extra I could've done myself. I will not be returning here..customer service was terrible and the lady that did the pedicure was extremely rude and acted like she was way better then anyone on the planet."
3,"I stopped here for gas and lunch one day. The employees are very friendly, fast, and great with small talk and I had no issues with my sandwich, but I can understand the frustrations of the girl who found a hair in her sandwich."
4,"Shannen is the best aesthetician I've experienced.  I'm in my late 50's and have gotten regular facials since I was in my 20's. She is knowledgable, responsive and always looking for ways to make my skin healthier.  Through Shannen, I've gotten to know Maureen.  She too is highly skilled at what she does.  I particularly like that she listens to her clients needs and does what is best for them as individuals.  I trust them both to do what's in my best interest and do it with great skill."
2,"Went to dinner here on a Tuesday night. I'm gluten free (not by choice) and our server was really great about going through my options. He was also great about checking back with us and asking us how everything was without being too present. I think his name was Ryan? Definitely a great server. The seating is pretty awesome too, especially if you're on a date. They have semi-enclosed booths that are great for a more private dining experience. The food was pretty good. We got the NY strip and the Cioppino. For the price I expected the Cioppino to have a little more shellfish and not so many onions and peppers. The steak had great flavor and was cooked as ordered. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the bartender. I myself can be quite a loud talker but the restaurant was very quiet and she was talking to her two guests at the bar so loudly that it ruined the experience for us. The bar isn't far from the tables but the whole dinner we got to hear about her allergies and how she loves to drink and how she doesn't fit in with the people in Austin. I've been in the service industry for over 15 years and I completely understand connecting to and having a conversation with your guest. And to her credit she was friendly but her speaking voice was so ridiculously loud we could barely have our own conversation. We actually rushed through our meal just so we could get out of there! The last thing I want to hear about when I'm eating dinner is how sick you got the last time your allergies flared up. There's a fine line between outgoing and obnoxious. If we went back we'd be sure to sit further away from the bar. Overall decent food and good service."
1,"It's a Burger King.  Standard Formula, standard food.\n\nOne thing that bugs me about this location is that they ALWAYS ask me to pull forward (not to the parking lot) but just forward to get my food.  I think it's because they don't want their drive through times to go through the roof.\n\nThat being said, the food production here is slower than others I've visited and the employees at times are hit and miss.  Teenagers that give no smile, don't even say a word to you (just put your hand out for payment) and in general don't give you the satisfaction of good service while spending your money.\n\nThe food is fine, the employees here need to work on their happy faces."
2,"Big, crowded, popular eatery.  Food is good, not great but I'm a food snob.  Girls at reception desk were too busy flirting with guy to greet guests, had to wait several minutes till they finally noticed I was standing there.  Ate at the bar, Jeremy the bartender was fantastic with great service and recommendations."
1,"Why didn't I check here first before buying the Groupon?  The wait is over 2 months and the only available time is 11 AM, which just doesn't fit into my work schedule.  I'll re-post a review if I can ever get my Groupon redeemed"
1,"Slimy noodles and lots of dim sum. Crowded, noisy, mediocre service. Very forgettable. It was so bad we went to the chocolate place at Bellagio afterward to recover."
0,"Less than expected.  Chicken was crispy on the outside and moist inside, but bland tasting.  I ordered their sauce, but ended up with only ketchup.  Fries were soggy, oily, and horrible.  It took a good 35 min for my food.  Overall, very underwhelming."
4,We are so thrilled to have such a clean modern spot for delicious Mexican food in sunneyslope! Everything was so fresh and plated very nicely. Friendly clean staff. We will be back many times. So much to try at a good price!
3,"The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.\n\nThe good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.\n\nI didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good."
3,"My folks are in town and i was looking to show off some of the \""Southwestern\"" flavor to them. So, i did some research and this little steakhouse came up and looked promising. And so it was on.\n\nIts situated inside of a Hilton Squaw Peak resort, just pull in and keep driving until you come upon it. It has a little parking lot surrounded by great cacti, shrubs and palms. Very cool and cute looking, with HUGE purple prickly pear cactus upfront (I am so jealous!). All very well maintained and looking real nice. \n\nOnce inside, we were promptly seated and attended by the waiter named \""Quick Draw\"". In 2 minutes we wanted to change tables because of the horde of raging 3 year old, and he was totally cool with that and did not give me a look or anything. So, service was really good then and through out whole dining experience. \n\nFood was good and plentiful. Their sizes are not  to be joked around - they LARGE! Everything we ordered tasted quite good and seemed to be fresh and well prepared. Drinks were good and honest as well. Even dessert had a bit of \""Southwest\"" flavor to it, as we ordered smores, which you make yourself at your table. That was kind of fun. \n\nOk, so, how come not all the stars? Its in resort by the pool, so there are people in stretched T-Tops and beach wraps, which kind of semi ruins it. Of course there are also wild yells of retards in the pool, and that does not help either. And of course above mentioned raging children, which are always experience killers. With all that said - It was not bad at all. As we came for dinner, tank topped people were at minimal, pool yellers only were heard a few times, and we hid away from the \""Ankle Biters\"" in the corner. \n\nGo there for dinner. Get a table by the fire pit on the patio. Gaze at the stars, munching on your meat. Stare at the mountain silhouette on the background while sipping on your margarita. This is the life you CAN get used to.\n\n\""I like\""\n\nEugene"
4,"Very nice spot with beautiful decor and a nice atmosphere. The oysters were excellent. They were offering 5 varieties the evening we went, each unique and all plump and perfectly shucked. Served with a champagne vinegar, 2 hot sauces and grated horseradish. Fried oysters were equally delicious with a light batter and a meaty bite inside. Citrusy mayo was served alongside. The tuna and salmon tartares were tasty with a subtle bite to them, served with crispy baguette bits. The beet salad was also a nice surprise away from the average beet salad with a sprinkle of Romano on top and served amidst strawberries and blueberries. The wine list is not the best but it is decent. The caesar was average. The service was excellent, our waiter was consistent and attentive. We will come back for a main very soon!!"
3,"This place is always busy but one can get seated pretty fast. The food is always heat. HOWEVER the service was surprisingly bad. What I order is none of the server's business. If I want to order something big then take most of it home, that is MY business not hers to comment on"
1,"I thought I'd love Primanti Brothers. Places like this are my thing. But I give it a big MEH. I ordered the cheesesteak. Risky move for a Philly girl off her home turf. First mistake. How dare they call this patty of meat product cheesesteak!?! But okay, fine. Besides that, the fries are soggy and bland, and overwhelm the sandwich with their blandness. I pulled most of them off. The bread is bland and floppy -- not sturdy enough for it's job. The best part is the slaw which is a little zippy at least, but not enough to redeem this tower of bland."
0,"Terrible service. Not even half capacity and it took almost 30 mins for entree. Chicken Teriyaki was nothing more than precooked, frozen, reheated chicken smothered in sauce and served with a side of salad. Sushi was less than average. much better places in other parts of the valley. Needs to hire more serving staff and improve their food quality. Will not be returning."
3,Very good place - the food was good - the dancers made it fun - a great place for a group.
3,"Mmmmm, I love Pita Jungle!  I have been frequenting this restaurant back when there was just the one on Apache and you ordered at the counter.  I live near this location on Dobson and Ray, so this has now become my place to go and get hummus and a chicken shwarma.   Since I've been coming here I pretty much only get those two items, knowing that they will be tasty and delicious.  I always order a large hummus and a couple of extra pitas and then box up the rest to eat later.  I gave 4 stars simply because the service can be hit-or-miss.  For example, I have received my food order- had it dropped off at the table and the person turn and leave- while I still have no plate or silverware.  Then I find myself waiting to find someone to ask for a plate and silverware.  Otherwise, start with a hummus and pick something else off the menu...you can't go wrong!  Just make sure you get a plate and silverware before your food!"
0,"Really, really slow. I know this isn't McDonalds, but 30 min. to get half our order and another 20 to get the rest? This was 9:30 am and there were only 6 other people in there the entire 1:15 hours we were there. Really cute place, small portions at great prices; but it just doesn't matter when they are so slow. Seriously, the woman behind the counter was even moving slow, no sense that people might be coming to her food establishment because they are hungry. And - the reason for 1 star- I could see her work because I was facing the counter, she was handling all the food with her bare hands. Picking up waffles, slicing strawberries, AND taking cash, answering the business phone, texting on her cell phone, never putting on gloves to handle food AND never washed her hands. Disgusting, I won't be back."
2,"My coworkers and I are here for a convention and came here for Dinner last night. \n\nOur waiters Scott and Adele were quick, attentive and really nice. \n\nWe have the pork belly dim sum as an appetizer, which was phenomenal! For my entree I had the hanger steak. For the price, I expected a bit more to it. When it says it includes carrots and peas, they meant one carrot and one pea :p But the steak was cooked perfectly ad tasted amazing. The rest of the group really enjoyed their dishes as well.  \n\nMargarita tasted good, but was a little weak, I stuck to beer after having one. Per my coworkers they had a great Pinot. \n\nHad a really nice time :)"
3,"The food here at the Beat is better than the coffee.  The sandwiches and salads are well prepared.  The ambiance encourages people to just be themselves, whether they want to chat with friends, listen to records, chow down on some sandwiches or just left alone to surf on the Internet or read. The location's great as well with plenty of street parking nearby and big windows for people watching.\n\nMy only complaint is that the coffee isn't that great. I overlook it because of all the other reasons I wrote above. But it is ironic that a coffee house should serve sub par coffee."
3,This place is great! A burrito shack & circle k gas in one stop! Where else can you stop and get gas for yourself and your car in one stop? Fill up your car and try the breakfast burrito supreme...you & your car will be gas-ed for the whole day.
0,"Has the potential to be awesome, but unfortunately extremely disappointing.  Bartenders were awful, not nice, and had no idea what they were doing. Medium rare burger came out well done, with cold fries. It wasn't even busy in there and the whole staff looked flustered. Will not be returning."
0,"I wish there was a way to give 1/2 stars. \n\nI visited this afternoon with my husband and son. Drinks at least came quickly. We ordered asiago cheese chips (the only decent part of the meal for me) and the server tried to walk away before my husband could order his suicide wings. \n\n***Side note #1. Someone that finds jalapenos hot, should not be able to comfortably finish a suicide wing. It was hot, but the Heart Attack at Yen Sushi is hotter.\n\nInstead of clearing the empty dishes first, she came out with a tray, and rather than coming the extra 3 feet around the table, held my Kummelweck sandwich in my face across the table until I took it.\n\n***Side note #2. Holding a bun under tap water and smooching seeds with regular salt on it prior to serving, is not the way to make a Kummelweck bun. I can understand the bottom of the bun being already disintegrated from the beef holding water and spilled Ah Jus when I got the plate, but the top bun should not only not be cold and soggy, my hand shouldn't look covered in wet sand after I put it down. \n\n***Side note #3. Au Jus should not have more grease than broth.\n\nI'd requested a salad, which wasn't brought out with dinner. The leaves were slimy, the tomato was rotten and the cheese looked like it had been living there for a few days. \n\nMy sons sliders meal was ok. At least this time you could see the meat on the sandwich. My husbands burger was ok, but didn't feel so hot afterwords.  \n\nThe only positive point from this experience was the asiago cheese chips.\n\nLack luster, lazy server, plus substandard food. Definitely won't be back."
2,"What do you write when you like everything about a place... except the food?  And even then, you didn't dislike the food, it just wasn't to your taste.  You see, RigaTony's serves up some hearty, meaty, thick lasagna... but the sauce is toooooo sweeeeet.  My friend and I thought the same thing.  Unfortunately, we both liked the restaurant but are not fans of sweet tomato sauce, instead preferring a garlicy, spicy sauce.  \n\nThat being said, if you are a fan of food on the sweeter side (which obviously many are since it was nicely packed)... I'd recommend RigaTony's.  The restaurant is way cute, service is great and you like the feeling you have when you're there.  It'd be good for a date, business meeting or just fun night out.  \n\nBtw, we found their tent at the farmer's market a few weeks ago and had to come in after that.  Offering up inexpensive, tasty breakfast pizza is a great marketing move! :)  And the 'sample' of wine that was delivered to our table when we first sat down was a good move too.  \n\nI'd go again if friends wanted to meet here but I'd order something that did not have a tomato-based sauce.\n\nMight not see ya there!"
4,"I always try to stay away from the chain hotels, but sometimes my shallow wallet just can't afford the big price tags associated with staying at boutique hotels.  Lucky for me, I found a deal that included flight and hotel for $500 for 4 nights.  Yay!\n\nI have stayed at the W Hotel in Montreal before, another boutique hotel but I just can't afford their prices without an expense account.\n\nThe Hotel Chez Swann is located on Drummond Street which is a hop, jump and skip away from downtown.  Peel metro station is located within a 2 minute walk and when Bixi bikes are in season (they stash them away in November), there is a Bixi stand right outside the hotel.  We pretty much walked everywhere and downtown was about a 20 minute walk away.  Not a bad way to work off the calories from all the yummy food to be had in Montreal.\n\nThe hotel itself has all the elements of a boutique hotel.  Dim lighting, funky decor, a peekaboo shower and even a plush seating area right in front of the window that looks out onto the street.  I couldn't help but feel I had walked into some sort of modeling shoot. \n\nPrior to arriving I had requested a room on the third floor because I didn't want there to be too much noise coming from the street.  However, being a factory-converted hotel, with only 3 floors, you could still hear the noise from the street at night.  But I slept through it all anyways.  We had a room with a great view of the street, thank goodness as I know one side of the hotel faces a parking lot!\n\nThe staff are all very friendly although on the first night of our stay, we noticed the sheets hadn't been changed and our toiletries hadn't been replenished - but they took our $2 tip anyways.  The next day I left a note requesting the said changes, and for the rest of our stay, these requests were met.  A nice thing that the cleaning lady did was stock our room with bottles of Eska water.  I guess she saw the insane stash of water we had in our room and saw us working out in the spin room!\n\nWe also requested a late checkout as our flight didn't leave until 8:30PM, and they extended it until 2PM without additional charges.  However, we didn't want to be wandering around town, so we just forked over the $80 to extend it until about 6:30PM.  \n\nBreakfast is served daily from 7AM - 10AM in the restaurant adjoining the hotel, Le Pois Pench\u00e9.  The breakfast selection is heavy - all pastries (pain au chocolat, almond croissants, plain croissants, cheese croissants, muffins, danishes, french baguette with butter, fig jam, and strawberry jam).  There is also a selection of juices and milk.  But the Espresso machine was a nice extra touch.  It was a Nespresso machine, and I was wired for hours!  They have about 8 different kinds of espresso, along with the standard coffee and tea.  You absolutely HAVE to try the cheese croissants as they not only had cheese on the outside, but also on the inside.  I found the sweet pastries to be TOO sweet to eat first thing in the morning.  The plain croissants were also good.\n\nIf you don't want to be eating croissants every morning you can also visit Q Nutrition House which is located at the very front of the hotel and serves up protein shakes, and healthy fruit smoothies of all kinds - but it isn't free. \n\nFor those of you who are keeners, you can use the spin room.  It is equipped with a television, towels and complimentary bottles of Eska water.  I used it all 4 days I was there.  Complimentary phone calls anywhere in North America and free wi-fi (password provided upon check-in). \n\nThere was only one night where we could hear rowdy teens coming in from a night on the town (around 3AM).  But other than that I have no complaints!  I would definitely recommend Hotel Chez Swann and would definitely stay here again."
3,"Let me just say this - for a person that doesn't really like Vegas, this place was fantastic  Granted, I did not pay and was there to do semi-light work (babysitting GF's 1yr old nephew) for Thanksgiving, but all in all, enjoyed it very much.  The craps did me well as did some college football which \""rolled\"" my way, so of course I am in a fantastic mood!  Tables looked nice, not nearly as smokey as, say, the New York New York, only downfall was no roller coaster.  I might be back.....in 3 years."
3,"Stopped by for a quick couple of wings and some ice tea. The waitress took our order and sent it off to the kitchen. When the server came out with our order it was completely wrong. The manager came out and did an excellent job of making everything correct and even took 15% off the bill. I like Buffalo wild wing, and I was pleased to see that the manager has the ability to correct things. We are a loyal customer and will continue to go to Buffalo wild wing at McQueen and Elliot!"
0,Walked in dirty tables everywhere.  Pork was unforgivably dry and sauce was not tasty.  Pho was just okay.  The worst though-my partner got sick the next day.
0,"Where do I begin?\n\nLong ago I remember \""Tom's BBQ\"" at Alma School and Warner.  It was decent.  Until San Tan BBQ came to town it was my favorite.  (Then San Tan closed and I discovered Joe's!!)  Tom's long-since left the place I remember.  Well, we were in the area of Chandler Heights and Gilbert tonight and thought \""why not?\"".  So we stopped in.  After all, Yelp showed 3 stars.\n\nWhen we entered the place was packed.  Good sign, I'm thinking.  We were seated promptly, and the waitress came by quickly.  She wasn't much for chatting, but she was friendly and professional.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich, my wife had the brisket sandwich.  We were very surprised how quickly the food came.  We both tried our beans first.  They were...OK.  Not really good, but not really bad either.  I removed the top bun because it seemed so small, but the meat was piled respectably thick.  Fine.  Put the bun back and take a bite.\n\nThis is where it goes wrong.\n\nThe meat was very tender.  That's about the best I can say about it.  The sauce was like a generic grocery store sauce.  Not bad, but not really good.  The meat seemed like it had been boiled, and then some sort of smoke flavor added.  It was nasty.  The \""smoke\"" flavor was not right, and not good.  Almost like a burned flavor, but not quite that either.  The after-taste of that flavor lingered about an hour after we left.  (What is that?!)  Compare and contrast to either Dave's or Joe's (both of which are good, though Joe's is much better).\n\nMy wife's brisket sandwich was no better.  Well, maybe a little better.  She said it also seemed like it had been boiled, but there was no smoke flavor at all (so she didn't have to deal with the after-taste like I did).  She was, however, a bit nauseated until after we got home.  I understand...my stomach felt like I had just had a Big Mac (that always leaves me a little queasy with the feeling of a rock in my stomach).\n\nIt was further, but we should have gone to Liberty Market instead.  We thought about it, almost did it, but this was closer.  Bad choice.  Never again."
1,"Ate here for lunch: very limited menu, service was horrible and the sodas were watered down. I ordered antipasti for my meal and the rosemary/sea salt focaccia bread: both were very good!\nI heard Rao's was better for dinner, and would be willing to try again."
3,"Oh fellow yelpers, is there anything more wonderful than an unexpected food find, a bit of culinary serendipity to brighten one's day? Such was my experience when coming across this delightful eatery in none other than the Phoenix Airport Dining area, next to Sauce, another solid eatery. \n\nI was catching a morning flight to California for the holidays and realized that Chelsea's kitchen had been put in since my last visit. I was charmed by the lights above the bar made from antique spritzer bottles and felt a little like I had stepped into an establishment in that greatest of American cities, New York. \n\nAs it was a bit early for me for lunch I ordered the oatmeal, which as far as oatmeal goes was excellent but I also ordered a cup of coffee and most glorious of surprises, they bring you a mug and a good sized french press, which you let sit for a few minutes and of course....you guessed it, press. The coffee was amazing. I asked the bartender what he thought and he agreed that it was exceptional. Best of all, between the oatmeal and the coffee the whole bill was only $8.20 and with tip, $10.50, that is a heck of good deal at the airport, not only on price, but on the exceptional quality. After reading the other reviews I'll be going back to the airport for something other than a flight and you guessed it, to eat at Chelsea's kitchen. \n\nNote, I loved the place but I want to try a meal or two before I consider the coveted five star rank but from my initial experience, a solid 4 with 5 start possibilities.:-)"
1,"Fell way short of all the hype. From what I'm reading, LA is better, but I can't imagine them being that much better. For starters, I did not care for the hard casings on the dogs. Flavor was not that great either. I really think this place gets by on their image more than their food."
2,"Overpriced (duhhh...it's the Wynn) deli. All the usual suspects in deli-style sandwiches, for around $12 each (fries/side not included).\n\nThe gem here is the vegan burger! For $9 you basically get a vegan Happy Meal: a little gardein \""cheese\""burger that tastes/looks just like those little McDonald's burgers, a side of French fries, and a little chocolate shake. It's a filling meal, and alllll vegan....which is great for me, because I looooove me some milkshakes, but my inability to digest lactose normally makes them an ugly proposition!!!\n\nIt's not really gourmet foodie-food....but it's solidly good, for being vegan -- and the price is great. I will probably have this again!"
2,"Good atmosphere, food is very good and I would give 4 stars but service was slow to\nto arrive at our table and we waited nearly 45 minutes for a burger. Staff is very pleasant!"
2,"Good place for what it is. We were looking for a way to kill time, and stumbled upon this museum. The current exhibit was Marvel vs. DC. It was cool to see some of the original sketches and strips, how characters changed over time and some of the \""behind the scenes\"" of what it took to create a cartoon/comic in different periods of time. \n\nTo see a little more about the evolution of cartoon/comic/graphic novels, and maybe a few more captions/placards to describe/ explain the pictures would make the museum a little more dynamic. \n\nNice (but super tiny) gift shop. Great price. Friendly staff."
3,"Ok so I normally don't go to buffets because typically they're overpriced and I never eat enough to make up the money but this one is awesome because for $30 you can eat ALL day as much as you want. Only drawback is that even on a weekend night they close at 10pm. BOO! Can't do that guys, it's Vegas! WTH! Oh well good food though honestly like almost every single thing I ate was delicious ranging from soups to sushi to pasta and even deserts. I def recommend the strawberry cheesecake even if you don't like it because OMG soooooooooooo yummy it hits the spot even with just one bite. Since we were staying at the hotel as well we got free drink tickets too and in the morning we both got complimentary champagne! How cool is that right? So yeah I think we'll be back :)"
2,"I really like the atmosphere of this pub when we first went there.  I liked how small and intimate it was.  I like dark, candle lit bars.  It just makes me feel a little more cozy. Unfortunately, the service was a bit lacking.  It took about 10 minutes to get a beer (on several occasions) when there was hardly anyone there, and they charged us twice for 2 single Jameson's. We didn't catch this until we had gotten home. It's not that big of a deal, but considering we went on a night when it wasn't that busy, you think they would be paying more attention to what was going on in front of the bar (i.e. people waiting for drinks) and behind the bar (i.e. getting someone's tab right) I have a feeling we'll be going back. It was a great time regardless, but I guess there are some things that just leave a bad taste in your mouth.  We'll be going back though. ;)"
4,"One of my favorite restaurants, Chez Vous in Scottsdale Arizona, serves Passport Coffee.  It was so good the other day that I had to know where they got it.  I will be ordering my own stash for home use, and will update this review after I git my hands on it!"
2,"Although it is a plastic paddys, it was a high energy plastic paddys last Saturday night.  We had lots of drinks and enjoyed watching the people and having our kidney stones pulverized by the driving bass.  Nobody singin about Danny Boy or how much they hate  the fuckin Brits in this joint!\n\nWe had fun but, if you are gonna call yourself an Irish pub, do something Irish."
3,"I always love grabbing a quick and clean power lunch at Greens & Proteins! \n\nI usually get the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap in a spinach tortilla. Side of Sriracha sauce. \nAmazing! \n\nAlso try the tofu fries, they are delicious. \n\nTop it all off w a Green wellness juice and you've got the perfect balanced lunch!!"
1,I had a super rude cashier made a huge fuss over a exchange of a broken item. I would have bought but because of her rudeness I did my exchange and left I didn't get her name but on my receipt it says cashier 1271421
2,"Went here yesterday with my many nieces and nephews for our 'kid's outing' as we like to call them (basically means their parents get a day off from their kids and my sis and I get to babysit them but on neutral turf: the mall).  \n\nGood thing this place wasn't busy when we arrived (4ish) because by the time all 7 of us would've sampled, filled, then contemplated our toppings and paid them, we would've pissed off and driven away everyone behind us... even though I did note the college or high-school gal behind the counter was very indifferent to us.\n\nThe yogurt selection was OK - they had tart, skinny blueberry, tropical something, red velvet, chocolate, vanilla and maybe 2 more that were standard fare (I rarely ever seen unique flavors like Durian..hehehe, except I have seen Taro Root at another Mojo by the Chandler Mall).\n\n.44c an oz is cheap, too.. they have good topping options, though the selection was 70% processed sugar... they rest of the 30% was pretty good though: almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and coconut, so not too bad."
4,"It's Vegas. People are already walking outside. It's kinda crowded and it's only about 830AM. I was hesitant to see all the people standing inside but I needed to get something quick and simple for my boyfriend.\n\nLet me tell you; I was in/out in maybe 5 minutes tops! I ordered two egg white breakfast sandwiches, two large orange juices, and a side order of pancakes. I ordered, walked off to go stand in a corner and my order was ready! I was blown away!\n\nStaff are quick, efficient, and on-point. Kudos to all these employees for working so hard and fast to cater to everyone down here!"
3,"I've been coming here for years. I like to stop by when I have to make a Fry's Electronics run. My favorite, beside a slice and salad, is their eggplant parm sandwich. I think they are one of the best in the in the Valley. (See my photo) I order the eggplant sandwich with a side of pepperchinies. Highly recommended. \n\nStaff is always friendly. A real family operated business, and always\nfriendly."
3,"They quoted me 15 minutes, and just 10 minutes later called my name to say it was done. Quickest oil change I've ever had.\n\nPaid $38 and some change with the $5 off Ladies' Wednesday discount."
3,"Fast cheap Mexican food. Very addicting. Love the chicken bowl from there. Pretty decent healthy option as well, as long as you don't add the sour cream and cheese. Only problem I have with Chipotle is that the amount of food you get each time is different, depending on the server."
4,"We just had an awesome weekend at The Palms!!! We had booked a great deal way back in April and when we arrived, Matthew at the check in desk, spent at least 25 minutes getting us a suite we could afford, instead of 2 rooms. It was so AMAZING for the four of us girls to stay together.... It made the trip! Matthew was super friendly, helpful, and professional. When I told him I'd write a nice YELP review about him he asked me to add \""GO RAYS!!!\"" ....so I am! BTW, the pool was great and Ghostbar was FUN!!"
3,"I am a HUGE fan of breakfast and this was one of the best I have had in the valley.\nI had the Wolfpack and was surprised at the size of the portion after reading on here about small portions! I could not finish the whole thing!\nThe hash browns were perfect! Crispy on the outside and nice and tender on the inside.\nHubby had the Chicken fried steak, the steak was  little tough and gristly but the batter was good with an unusual flavor and the gravy had large chunks of sausage and was very tasty.\nWe ordered my 4 year old the eggs and sausage off of the kids menu and they came with a large portion of tater tots and toast. More than enough for our little guy, next time we will order a wolfpack and just share with him.\nWe decided that we would definitely go again but just not in the summer since we don't enjoy sweating while we eat."
0,"Just called to see if I could get someone to take a look at our gate. The young girl answering the phone, without even asking my name or what was wrong with the gate told it me would cost $225... Asked her if maybe they might want to take look at the gate first, see how big it was etc. maybe let me get out two words explaining the issue but she said that's just what it costs for a repair period and was done with the very rushed curt conversation. Might want to work on that customer service Artistic."
2,"As a regular patorn of Doc and Eddy's down the street I have tried to give this place a chance multiple times. First off the place is very nice and the food is great. However, if you sit at the bar and are expecting good service forget about it. I have been here 5 times and all but once sat at the bar. The table service is pretty good however the bar service is about the worst I have seen anywhere I have been. The last time the bar was completely empty and it still took 22 minutes to get a drink. Yes I timed it. and that just wasn't the first time I have done this.\n\nIf I didn't prefer to sit at the bar the rating would have been a 4.5."
2,"free admission wednesdays, from 5-9pm. \n\nhate to admit it, but i wouldn't return unless its during free/wed evenings. the location is great & theres plenty of activities to do and places to eat nearby. the museum itself has incredibly friendly staff, building is beautiful, & the interior is lovely, clean, etc. so why 3 stars? i simply didnt have that ohhh i love it vibe. & id never consider paying for admission here. granted, contemporary art isnt really my thing, but i always give it a try & i have seen exhibits that i could not resist visiting again.\n\nanyways, id definitely advocate for folks to carve out an hour wednesday evening and hit up musee d'art contemporain de montreal!"
4,"Cheap and fast -express !! - delicious hummus and taromasalata , the burgers weren't bad ,  a convenient location for where I was working - myself and colleagues had around fifteen meals here in the space of a week , - nothing wrong with any of them."
3,"Great atmosphere and really yummy food. If you want drinks, go during happy hour; for food go during dinner.\n\nIn the dead of summer the flies are not a problem, mostly because the doors are closed."
4,"5 stars because it's 100% non-smoking!!!! MOST EXCELLENT!\n\nI hate Las Vegas, but love coming to golf.  Finding a place to stay where I can breathe is difficult...this little joint filled the bill.\n\nOk, it's odd that it's dog friendly, but I'd rather smell dog than smoke any day.\n\nRates are good, the rooms are spotless (we had one with the big jacuzzi tub - well worth the few extra dollars.)\n\nYes, the cable sucks - and even if we are in Vegas some of us do want excellent cable coverage, and this didn't have it....never could find NBC.\n\nThe cable is tough for sure; we found later at night and first thing it was fine...the place was 100% sold out and I can see why.\n\nHave fun!"
2,"After deciding to learn how to play the guitar for the third time, I ended up at Varsity music, a no-brainer as I walk past it almost every day. It's a cute music store on Nicolson Street, right opposite Edinburgh University's Old College. A friend and I bought our guitars within a day of each other and managed to become quite friendly with the staff, who I suspect may be the owners as well. We managed to score a discount and one of those electric tuners, which I'd put down to our natural charm! Although I'm not a musical expert, I will say they had a great range of guitars, some tipping the \u00a3300 scale, but mine was thankfully an affordable \u00a360. Guitars come with a case, a few picks if you're nice and will usually be tuned; if not just ask and they should happily oblige. They also sell some great instructional material, and I believe they offer lessons as well!"
1,"Horrible service, ok burgers, good fries. Overpriced and a la carte ordering (burgers and fries separate). Waitress didn't place our order with the kitchen then offered 15% off after waiting 1.5 hours for burgers and fries. Nice patio seating in Oakland."
3,Very bomb sandwich place choose this place over Jimmy John's and Subway. The milkshakes are great you can combine two flavors of your choosing and they're very tasty! I also love how they can toaster subs through toaster to make them toasty!
4,The best guacamole! Everything fresh. We were a party of 4 and all my French guest enjoyed their meal. Perfect service and reasonable pricing for the quality of food served. Thank you !
3,This place is great to walk around. Anyone into art needs to check this place out.
3,"Fantastic breakfast in Uptown Waterloo. They have a simple menu that's well priced, and great coffee to match the food. \n\nFor lunch or dinner you'll also find a simple but complete menu that matches the beer available on tap. From a couple in house brews to some local classics you'll find something you like."

0,"Caution when buying a used bike from these guys.\n\nI realized that buying a used bike would cost me more than if I bought it directly from a person directly.  I believed the trade off would be that the dealer would have thoroughly gone through the bike before putting it for sale  (Oh so I should not need a second opinion from soemone else).\n\nI tried to test drive the bike before purchasing it, but the solid answer was no.  Under no circumstances do they let you test drive (OK I get the insurance issue, even though I have my own).  So I couldn't get a second opinion if I wanted to.\n\nI bought the bike anyways, as it was the one I had been looking for (2006 VFR800).  On my ride home the bike felt and sounded odd, but I had previously owned a cruiser, so maybe they are suppose to sound and feel like this and I just needed to get use to it. I rode it the next day and it just didn't seen right so I called the Apache dealer in Phoenix (I live in Phoenix not Mesa) and asked if they would just ride it around the block and tell me if the bike was running as it should.  They got me in the next day (2 days after purchase) and guess what the chain drive needed to be replaced.  That was the cause of the odd feel and sound.  Instead of them working with the Mesa store, I had to call the Mesa store and work with the sale guy to let him know of the issue and ask what he was going to do.  We talked, he called the Phoenix store to verify and asked if I wanted to bring it to Mesa or Phoenix to replace the chain drive (free of charge).  I scheduled it for the Phoenix dealer.  While they replaced the chain I also asked that they look over the entire bike as I was going on a 1500 mile trip with the new bike in 2 days.  They did and said nothing else was wrong.  \n\nWow, replacing the chain drive made a world of difference.\n\nLater that day I was talking with some biker friends and they asked if they changed the sprocket too.  I said no, why.  They explained that typically the sprocket is always changed at the same time.the chain is replaced.  So now I am nervious again,  I take it to another mechanic and have them do a once over to see if It needed anything.  Guess what...it did.  Some how both dealerships missed the fact that there was too much oil.  Not a little over but alot about a cup (He showed me).  So I had him drain it to an acceptable level.  Also the clutch fluid needed to be changed.  He said I could hold off until after my trip.\n\n Ok so I bought a used bike from a dealer who abviously doesn't / didn't  do a full inspection before selling it and I had to spend my time and money to correct things they should have done or told me about.\n\nI can't speak to the new bikes, but if you buy a used bike from these guys plan on spending more money to have it inspected again as they don't do a thorough job."
4,"I cannot say enough great things about Copyfast!  When it comes to award winning service and product production - they are at the top of my list.  It is nice to know that family-oriented, specialized copy centers still exist!  I had the opportunity to meet the owners one day, although at that time - I did not know that they owned Copy Fast.  After a brief chat with them - I can see why their copy center is the best in town.  I knew I loved this place before, but now after meeting them and hearing about the passion they have for their store, their customers and their employees - I am even more thrilled that I have this place to go to for all my copy needs!"
0,"Housed in the perennially empty The Palazzo shopping arcade, I Love Burgers only fit in this shopping center is on price  - costly, it would be better suited in the Miracle Mile mall up the road, but it would need to drop its prices a considerable sum in order to not scare off its middle America patrons.\n\nNow we all know that Las Vegas is not the value destination it was once decades ago, but $7.00 for a shake?  The price cannot easily be justified, unless the milk was made with organic or raw milk and even then, that would be a stretch.  Appetizers of cheese sticks would have probably been better still frozen as a cheese pop, rather than the fried bland rectangles that they were.  One kitchen staff member easily observed from the counter when I was seated was busy wiping his runny nose with his hand which promptly went into a bin of cooked french fries, talk about salty, glad I didn't order the fries.\n\nThe enormous space, which used to house a Asian restaurant in a different lifetime will probably meet the same fate, unless they place more effort in preparing better tasting foods and renegotiating the lease on the space to reduce costs."
3,"I went to Flat Top Grill last night on a date, and I really enjoyed it! \n\nThis was only the second time I've ever really been to a stir fry place like this, but I thought their selection of veggies and such was pretty good. Everything I chose to put in my bowl tasted pretty fresh. I was kinda confused about which sauces to use, so I chose from their suggestions. I had the sweet and spicy sauce, and I really liked it.\n\nThey don't really have a wide array of appetizers to choose from, but I don't think that's supposed to be their specialty. I'm generally an appetizer person though, so I had the shrimp summer roll, it was light and tasty. A good opener for the meal.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, I found that great too. It was pretty crowded while I was there, but the tables are far enough away from each other that you don't feel like you can hear everyone else's conversations, i really like that.\n\n\nAlso, a student discount is always a plus.\n\nI would definitely go back again!"
3,"Fast, friendly service with good plate dishes.  I was excited to see they had lau lau, which I had always heard about from people that lived in Hawaii, but had never tried before.  Since I've never had lau lau before, I can't really speak to how authentic it is, but it was pretty good in my opinion.  The taro leaf it was wrapped in tasted a bit briny, and like seaweed, which tasted a bit weird to me, but it did remind me of eating something from the islands.  The pork inside though was delicious- slow cooked, full of flavor.  The lau lau also comes with a side salad, and a side of meat, which makes for a very filling and satisfying meal.  I chose the Hawaiian salad, which was kind of like the Hawaiian version of vinegar-based coleslaw.  It was a nice mix of tangy and crunchy.  I chose the kalua pork, which was excellent.  It was slow roasted and tender, with a nice smokey, salty flavor.  I also tried some katsu chicken, which was very nice and crispy, and came in a tangy dipping sauce.  If I'm ever in the area, this is the place to stop and grab a tasty Hawaiian style plate."
4,"Stumbled across this little place while looking for a quick place for breakfast on our way out of town.  Unexpectedly, they make the best cheesy grits I've had in the north! Seems like a busy local favorite."
1,"This is a hard review to write. So I'll need to rate it on several different criteria:\n\nThe good:\nHotel lobby & rooms: very beautiful, spacious and well appointed. Our family of 4 enjoyed the layout. Very much like an upgraded embassy suites - which works great for a family of 4! The valet people couldn't have been nicer.\n\nOn-site Water park - yay! 2 tall slides, a lower loopy slide (my fave) a lazy river and a wave pool. Free towels, plenty of shade, and decent chair service. Plus a good amount of self serve icy water. Very appreciated. Plus regular pools and hot tubs near your rooms.\n\nThe bad\nThey are trying to save money in every direction, which makes it all seem very thrifty in a luxury setting.\n- Lots of signs and Chatter about buying a timeshare\n- They closed the lobby sundry store before 7:00 pm!!! Both nights!! Posted times were open weekly until 9:30.\n- you are charged a $40.00 resort fee per suite that covers a bunch of stuff you don't need, but includes 2 good items: free wifi (although it's slow) and free water park admission. So it's a wash for me. I don't need the free valet - its a 10' walk, nor the USA today delivered, nor a one way shuttle to the mall.\n\nThe ugly\nI was smoking mad about the lobby store closing before the posted time. My plan had been to stop in after our dinner (we dined in their lobby restaurant) and pick up some breakfast items, plus some wine. Instead we paid $30 for a bottle of wine at the restaurant, and $50 for breakfast room delivery. And on that, it was late, and several items were missing. We had an early appointment, and couldn't use the lobby restaurant. Total bust.\n\nWhen I called the lobby reception to ask about it, they couldn't have cared less. They said \""well yeah, they leave if it's dead\"".\n\nThe cost of keeping an employee in there is $15.00 an hour. They would have sold 100.00 based on myself, and the 2 other couples that we're not sure why it was closed. Sadly, this just points to a very inexperienced manager in the economics area. Basically, 1 customer an hour will break it even.\n\nWould I stay here again? Yes. The Rooms are great. But it's just not a high end experience. We ate at 2 of the restaurants, and both were marginal at best.\n\nIf you have kids, stay here. But don't eat here (it's really overpriced for crappy food). And do use the coupons they give you!"
1,"Be forewarned: they are very heavy in their sauces, and you can order light sauce. This would have been helpful to us if we had known before hand. \n\nWith that being said, this place was a disappointment.  It's Italian food with upscale pricing, but low scale food quality. I've never been to an Italian restaurant where they serve prepackaged butter with their bread sticks. The food was covered in their sauce, and it looks like you received a bowl of sauce. They do serve a lot of food, and we were like every table there: taking food home in a container. \n\nThe ambiance was very dark and loud. Dress ranged from formal to tshirt casual. The staff was very friendly, though. \n\nIn the end, I don't think I'd make another visit here on my next Vegas trip."
3,"This is one of my fave spots close to home. If you haven't been here before, their staff has samples of items on their menu for first timers. I always order a 2 item combo: Jen Red Pork & Chinese BBQ Pork with Pork Fried Rice. It's like heaven in my mouth. My girlfriend and I come here at least once a week. Also if you come here don't forget to make room for the cookie!"
1,"Pushing the boundary of the Chinese buffet.\n\nGenerally I'll visit an establishment at least three times prior to writing a review.  A second or third visit to Mike Kwan's Gold Coin would be of surprise to me. CASH ONLY, with tax included $6.15 paid for my admission to this buffet-style meal.  Kid's under the age of four eat for $2.  It was surprisingly busy.\n\nThe \""buffet\"", in its entirety:\nWon-Ton Crisps\nFried Rice\nChow Mein\nMixed Vegetables\nFrench Fries\nEgg Roll Halves\nFried Chicken\nHot Wings\nSweet & Sour Pork\n\nHere in lay my greatest criticism; Yes, technically, there is more than one Chinese item among the food set out in large trays for an individual to return to as many times as they like.  In no other way does the Gold Coin overlap with common consumer expectation of a \""Chinese Buffet.\""  So, why was it so busy?  Because, for a tick north of five bucks a person could gluttonously stuff themselves with the above items; it is better thought of as an economical \""family-style\"" meal.  If it was advertised as such, I bet Mike's would get better reviews as people wouldn't feel mislead when they walked in, and the balance of Chinese, to American, to Italian, to Mexican to whatever cultural dishes would be freed up as well.  It has its redeeming qualities, which is why it didn't get the single start rating; it's clean, inexpensive, and seemed like a friendly casual atmosphere."
3,"I was in Las Vegas this week for a convention and my boss took the crew out to dinner at the Steak House one night since we were all staying at Treasure Island.\n\nTypical steakhouse menu: The meat was anywhere between $32-$50 depending on your cut of choice, everything was a la carte with side dishes in the $8-$15 range.  Good thing boss man was taking care of the bill...\n\nMy 8 oz. filet came out with a whole bulb of roasted garlic - OH YEAH.  Automatic star just for that tasty garnish.  My filet was more of a medium than a medium rare as I ordered, but I was too exhausted and hungry after a 10 hour day of standing and trying to sell to complain about it.  I got the sauted broccolini  as my side, and an order of the bearnaise sauce.  I thought $2 for 1 oz. of sauce was ridiculous - but whadduyagunnado? It's Vegas, baby. Vegas.  Where prices are just as inflated as all the showgirls breasteses. *BA DUM BSSH*"
2,One of the less-bad clubs in the area. It's a little more lounge-like and chill. I suggest visiting with a group and to prearrange seating.
3,"I went to Toast expecting an average breakfast, but they exceeded my expecations. I ordered the stuffed strawberry french toast  (delicious). I appreciated that the french toast was not soggy. The managers were friendly."
4,"At $10 per adult, you can't really go wrong here. We spent probably a little over 2 hrs at the museum and felt it was well worth the price of admission. I enjoy American History, and this was no exception."
3,"This is me and my friends favorite spots after a night out! I love there salsa bar! There tacos, burritos, and sopes are on POINT!!"
3,"Rosie's is mine and my sister's go to beer place. It is conveniently close and just very cozy. I always get the Magner's Cider which is so damn delicious, and Wenesday's live performer is always so delightful to listen to."
0,"I've spending a lot of time with a friend who is a pretty serious coffee drinker.  A couple nights ago, we stopped in at Hava Java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door.  Being the afternoon of July 4th, the place was empty, save for the barista and a guy who was in there chatting her up.  I ordered a cafe au lait, he an iced coffee of some sort.  After asking me if I preferred skim milk or 2%, the barista handed me my cup of milk and foam and told me the coffee was self-serve and pointed me in the direction of the three coffee dispensers on the other side of the bar.  Really?  $3.75 for a cafe au lait and I have to pour the coffee myself?  I suppose that wouldn't have been entirely terrible if it had been any good.  It's amazing how much difference whole milk makes, but even beyond that, the coffee was weak and flavorless, and since it had to be pumped over the weak foam and milk, my drink tasted like little more than a drip coffee with milk.  Lame.  Sorry, Hava Java - a repeat customer I will not become.\n\nP.S. - A $0.25 \""service fee\"" is charged to all credit/debit transactions.  Again, lame."
4,"If you're reading this...read no further! Just make a reservation, take your ass to the stratosphere, hop on that  elevator that's more like a rocket ship, eat,indulge and enjoy every second of it!!! (And thank me later with desert). K, bye!!!!"
4,Amazing customer service. These guys know what they are doing. I would give them 10 stars if I could! Highly recommend.
2,"For a while, this used be a fun place for breakfast.  The menu had a special section emphasizing a local, seasonal twist.  I've had chicken and waffles which came in three petite waffles, with a tasty morsel of fried chicken on each - interesting meals with creative twists.\n\nSadly, the last visit (Feb '13) to the cafe showed a breakfast menu with just the standards - eggs, pancakes and waffles.  Customizable, which is nice, but hardly remarkable.\n\nGets busy and a bit wait-ey, despite the numerous servers.\n\nSad that it went from a breakfast destination we looked forward to, to a breakfast that's there and just serviceable if there's nothing else around."
2,"They have a nice assortment of music on the weekend.  The drink menu is comprehensive, we were happy with what was offered. Spacious and we were comfortably seated - much nicer than so many other bars around town.  \nIt reminded us of a cruise ship."
4,"If you're looking for the only place to spend more than $300 for dinner, come here. I promise, you won't be disappointed! \n\nSW Steakhouse is a very classy and swanky restaurant. Here's the scoop on why I award them a 4.0 GPA:\n\n+ Seating was very quick, but I recommend making a reservation because this place is uber popular. \n+ The servers were right on key with EVERYTHING. You definitely get what you pay for. The management here really keep the ambiance and experience top notch with every aspect of the meal. For example, my ice tea (not a big drinker obviously) was always filled. My colleague's 1/2 bottle of wine was poured perfectly\n+ All the food came out in a timely manner! Very important especially when there's multiple guests in your party. \n+ Our servers were very professional, but funny. Their humor felt real and I felt a good connection with them. \n+ The food was absolutely excellent: veal (scrumptious and tender with the bone in...) Thanks to SW, I've found my favorite food of all time. crab soup was filling and was presented in a artful way, making it better tasting! \n+ For me, it's all about the bathroom, but at SW, they gave us this dessert that lifted my spirits so high! Sounds corny, but damn, I was hella happy. I saw in the corner of my eye this dessert structure of mini funnel cakes on a mini tree lined with fat strawberries and 3 dipping sauces. I seriously hope I'm this happy when I get married. \n\nLastly, know that you're paying for excellence here so don't be surprised. If you have it in your budget to have dinner here, I highly recommend it. And don't forget to try that dessert. Maybe you'll be as happy as I was."
4,Delicious food and drink.  Great atmosphere.  Love it.
0,"OMG.\n\nTerrible experience here.  We expected a lot because it's a beautiful country club.  Our evening started by walking into a mostly empty restaurant and standing at an empty host desk for 5 minutes.  The hostess then swung by to tell us it would be 10 minutes before they could seat us.\n\nWe went to the bar and ordered a couple drinks and an appetizer (cheese plate).  The drinks came quickly but the appetizer did not.  15 minutes later we were seated in the dining room (only 2 other tables had people there).  It's worth noting that the hostess actually stopped to talk to people as she lead us to our seats, for at least a minute or two, both of us standing awkwardly waiting for her to finish her conversation and show us where to sit.  Shockingly unprofessional.\n\nOur waiter came over quickly and was unaware that we were still waiting for the cheese plate.  He took our orders (she wanted a salad, I just got a burger) and disappeared.  No bread was offered to us.  The cheese plate eventually made its' way to our table with 3 slices of bread and approximately 19 billion pieces of meat & cheese.  Still no bread or biscuits offered to us even though other tables had them.\n\nHer salad arrived without dressing, along with my burger.  The waiter did not come back to check on us.  Near 15 minutes passed before I could flag one down and ask them to get her dressing; by this time I was done with my dinner.  At this point they asked if we wanted bread.  Another 10 minutes later the bread and her salad dressing came out.\n\nOur drinks were empty for this duration as well.  What a cluster.  To add insult to the experience, 18% gratuity was added automatically to the bill.  We spoke the manager about the experience and he apologized about our experience, and justified the long wait to seat us despite the empty restaurant saying that they had a backup in the kitchen and didn't want us to be seated and wonder why we weren't being served food quickly.  Well, we wondered anyway.\n\nWe could have been seated and at least had bread & drinks instead of being treated like second class citizens waiting at the bar while the restaurant remained empty.\n\nThe food was marginal.  The burger is not a complicated culinary endeavor, but managed to taste like a (nice) mass produced frozen patty.  The fries were terrible.  Her salad was okay, but truthfully the food could have been perfect and we'd still be upset as the service was deplorable.\n\nThe manager asked us to come back for a second chance.  We may do it and if our experience is better we'll update this.  On the other hand, neither one of us are particularly excited to go back.  As of now, not recommended."
0,"Went to see Amy on a Groupon.  She did the fastest cut in the west!  It looked Ok, not the greatest (which I expected from this place).  I got home and my son said \""Mom, you have a mullet!\""  Yep, sure enough the cut wasn't even in the back.  I went back in an hour and she got me in to fix it.  Unfortunately, now I'm at home I see it doesn't match the other side of the back of my head.  Ok....if this was Super Cuts or something like that I'd just live with it.  NOT Leiden Mitchell....I guess with a Groupon they give you a half price cut."
2,"A very unique menu with a lot of out of the box breakfast options. I had the chorizo omelette and it was delicious, but the potatoes stole the show. Crispy and very flavorful. A friend had the duck hash and that was great, but the scrambler and the bacon omelette were a bit disappointing to the others dining with us. They serve bloody Marys during brunch and those also weren't great...especially at $7 each\n\nThis is a restaurant where customers order at the counter and serve themselves for drinks/coffee then are given a # and a member of the staff brings your food out. So, not full service and it can get busy making finding a table tricky.  \n\nOverall, it was decent but pretty expensive. For two of us, our meal was $45 (including one cocktail). Pretty pricey for \""just OK\"" food."
2,"Hey it's Taco Bell - what do you want?  I'm giving this three stars because it's A-Ok which is Yelp's rating system.\n\nIf you haven't been to a Taco Bell before then I don't know what to tell you - it's cheap imitation Mexican food with questionable quality ingredients.  It's not like you're going to take the pope here for a visit though, you're just getting some food.\n\nThe staff at this location are helpful and pleasant, and that's really all I ask for.  I don't come here often, but it's true to the Taco Bell brand."
4,Yoga Styles rock!  Susan has created gorgeous and functional custom products for my acu-wellness practice/business...she is a creative genus...easy to talk too and always willing to try something...I love my Yoga Styles products...and am grateful for Susan Nichols!
3,"Let's face it, Scottsdale can be a real pain in the ass.\nDress codes, pomp, and general douchebaggery are not uncommon in this town.\nSometimes you just want to sit down and have a beer, sans all the nonsense.\nCoach house is your place.\n\nThere's a reason this rickety wood building is so popular.  Especially it's done up in tacky christmas lights! I It's easy, and fun, and super low maintenance.\nTwo bars ensure you are not waiting forever to fill your glass, and the addition of a food truck out front makes satisfying the beer munchies super easy."
0,"The most hostile people I have ever met.  Horrible in every respect, I am surprised people pay for the abuse they deliver.  My experience with XS was hands down the worst I have ever had with any venue, ever.  They ruined my birthday, embarrassed me, and I believe potentially charged me for it.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!"
3,"Staying at South Point this past weekend I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nI was very skeptical and unsure of what to expect considering it is 15 minutes away from the strip and only $70 a night. I mentally prepared myself for the worst. \n\nDriving into the hotel everything was very self explanatory and it wasn't absolute mayhem like most hotels tend to be in Vegas. We did the free self park (tons of parking spaces available) and walked straight into the hotel. The check in was easy breezy and they even give you a coupon book to use during your stay. \n\nPros: \nRooms are huge \nCheap rates \nBowling alley (open 24 hours) \nArcade (with air hockey) \nCoupon book \nNice pool \nMovie theater \n\nCons: \nNo shows available at the hotel \nCab ride onto the strip is about $18-$26 depending on traffic \nCrowd is not very young or attractive \n\nI guess it depends what your motives are but I think South point is nice in that you get to go out of town and be close to Vegas, without being around all the hustle and bustle that comes with Sin City."
3,"I shop at sprouts for all my produce and meat and have always chose Sprouts over any local market for their quality of and I love the check out staff.  Recently we had family in town and decided to cook up a nice BBQ dinner for them. We purchased a few pounds of some Pork baby back ribs along with several other items to go along with.  My husband and my dad cooked the ribs on a slow cook all day long, later that evening they noticed that the aroma in the house was \""sour\"" and sure enough they pulled the ribs out of the oven and they were indeed sour (my husband fell victim to a taste test.) They immedieltly took the ribs back to the store to see if they could work something out. They were helped out by the checkout manager, with his accommodating service & very pleasant personality. He gave them back a full refund and allowed them to purchase the few pounds of kabobs that they chose, on the house.  He was apologetic for the inconvenience, making light of the situation and was understanding. My husband and my dad felt that after a \""wasted day of cooking\"" and a late kabob dinner, Sprouts was redeemed through such great customer service!!!!!! I love this location even more now :)  Thank you."
2,"The short: Get the \""white cookie\"" fresh from the oven, at the front cafe for $5. OMG. OMG. \n\nThe long: inside at the restaurant: long waits, water refills - had to ask each time. \""Sunday pasta\"" did a number on my tummy! :-(. Best thing on the menu - the $5 white cookies in front cafe, fresh out of the oven. Wish i spent my groupon on just those cookies. Forget the entrees, they're nothing special - typical ingredients prepared en masse so they can be thrown together and then onto your plate. That's how it tastes. And you'll pay a premium to find out I'm right."
3,I have to say I am a fan! The Stetson Chopped salad has got me hooked on this place. I literally get it go once a week! I have taken pretty much everyone I know here just to get this salad! \n\nThe Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry is also a great choice! If you still have a sweet tooth at the end of your meal definitely try the Apple Cobbler with brie cheese crema and duck fat ice cream! WOW its truly amazing and so different from any apple cobbler I've ever tasted. \n\nThe service here is always great and they are friendly and quick!
0,"honestly, the food isn't half bad. THe mac and cheese is amazing. Theres a great variety and lots of bar service, however, they way the treat their employees is disgusting. i was there eating one night, a table next to make CLEARLY mead a mistake from being too intoxicated, threw a drink on (think the hostestess  name was Beth or something) and even thought she wasn' t the server, she made my night a million time better. She had a real conversation with me and brought me plenty of free beverages to make up for it. However, the manager didn't see how hard she was working (bussing too many tables to handle and too many people to handle) and completely disregarded her efforts.. Our ticket was also off by SEVERAL dollers, Kim, the manager came to handle it and instead of comping out meal she gave out free coupons for a drink nexr visit....which there wont me. I hate this place to say is the least"
2,"Do you like being entertained by a knife-wielding Asian chef cooking at your table while you eat?  If this may sound interesting, grab a group of friends and check this place out.  Just don't expect the food to be stellar, and if you order sushi be prepared for less than average.  Benihana is a chain that specializes in a culinary circus type environment over anything else."
1,Tried the Summerlin location.  Too expensive for pizza.   You have to pay for toppings.  Veggie toppings $4.00 and $3.00 for meat toppings. My husband I don't like the same toppings so we tried to order 1/2 on one side and 1/2 on other side.  They charge full price still for each topping even if only on 1/2 the pizza..  Pizza looked large but not filling due to the thin crust.  A small with two toppings will set you back $16.00 bucks.  Was shopping at Fashion Show mall with friends and they wanted to try this place.  4 calzone's and 4 sodas later set us back $91.00 without tip.  Ouch.  Could have gone upstairs to the food court and had the same items and payed 1/3 what we payed for this tasteless calzone.
4,"Wanted to start off day with a good meal, dropped by del taco never at breakfast here before. The food was fresh the service amazing. Thanks del taco for making me full and happy and ready to start day."
2,The decor if this restaurant is very beautiful! You get a view of the strip because there is an open seating area that everyone in the restaurant gets a view of. I was hungover here when I came here so I did not order a drink but I think $32 for a drink is pricey and they all looked like they would give me a bad headache because of all of the sugar. So I ordered a hot chocolate and for a place that is named sugar it was not sweet at all. To eat I orders the ham croissant with potatoes and got an egg on top! The food was out of this world good so I am glad I ordered that. My sister on the other hand got a crepe and it was horrible because they put all the toppings on top and not inside the crepe and it got chewy really fast pretty disgusting so that's why they get three stars it was just ok.
3,"I have a little bit of emotional attachments to Biodome since it's the first ever attraction I went to in Montreal, its the place where boyfriend and I had our first date and I love animals - particularly when they are allowed to roam freely in an habitat resembling their own natural environment. \n\nI went back for a return visit two years later and still loved it as much as the first time. It is one of the few unique zoos where the visitor follows a designated path through the lushes forests and is immersed in the world of the animals, discovering a little frog under the leaf, a bird in the trees, a turtle crawling on the ground, it brings a sense of wonder and discovery for both adults and children, from tropical to arctic to the ocean. When we went the first time, they had their 'Butterfly Go Free' event where you are admitted into the room where butterflies are free flying everywhere, sometimes even on the clothes of visitors. Remember that fairy tale dream of being surrounded by butterflies? This is it.\n\nBiodome is one of the museums in the complex near Olympic stadium and its tickets can be purchased as parts of combo with the Planetarium, Botanic Garden, Insectarium and Olympic Stadium. If you are visiting more than one attraction, skip the line at Biodome and get the tickets at another attraction."
3,"Always a consitent, great meal.  The service is excellent - we've always had really friendly staff.  I LOVE the beat salad and the mushroom pasta special (served only at lunch)."
1,The only reason this place does not get one star is because the food did not make us sick. The Bellagio buffet was rather disappointing for our entire group. We went for dinner and it was $30. We waited 45 minutes in line on a Monday night to get in which we figured would result in great food. Wrong! First our server took forever to get our order. She seemed to have no way of knowing when we arrived because she first went to 2 tables that got there after us before getting to ours. However that's not why I'm rating the review bad. The crabs legs didn't seem so fresh and the buffet had a rather mediocre selection compared to the other buffets we visited. The desert selection was rather plain and neither of the two ice cream machines worked. I tried the house Merlot and it was horrible. The Kobe beef had an awkward taste to it and none of us took a second bite. To make things worse for the entire hour we were there our server never picked up our previous place or refilled our water. Talk about bad service. \n\nWe all agree not to visit this buffet on our next visit. We expected much more from the Bellagio.
0,"I don't even want to waste a lot of time talking about how bad this place is...I'll try and sum it up. \n\n*Dining room was dirty, uncomfortable and hot. \n\n*Service was lacking. 10 min for the first greet. 20 min to order. 30 min for food. Every chance the server had he would go an do his side-work while eating...right in front of us. \n\n*Found a water glass at the table with lipstick. When we asked for a new one the server simply pulled one of the table new to us. NOTE: server man handled the glass at the top...where people put their lips! \n\nFood: Blah. Nothing exciting to report.  Maybe it's because I could get past the server putting his hands all over my glass.  Yikes. \n\nI wanted to like this place..."
1,Food was mediocre at best.  Plus they tried to over charge me.  Look at your bill carefully.
1,"Strange little place hidden on 5th St. in uptown that for some reason stays packed. Of course, it's not really hard to pack this place, as small as it is. It does seem to be popular though, probably mainly due to the scenery of the bartenders. \n\nUnfortunately, you only get a glimpse of them as you grab a drink and try to stay out of the crush. And good luck getting back to your group or your table without spilling half of your drink, if you are lucky enough to find a place to sit.\n\nLive bands and, more often, DJs are in there spinning some decent tunes, but Phil's is more often a staging point for the rest of the evening, a springboard to bigger places and better things."
1,"I have been to other Urgent Cares, and no experience was quite like the one I experienced on Thursday.\nAfter getting home from a job interview, I promptly slipped on a stair and broke my foot. The bone was sticking out, not through the skin, but definitely poking out. Immediate thought - I should go to the hospital, but my copay is way too expensive for my student budget, so my roommate drove me over to Advanced Urgent Care.\nThe wait wasn't long, but I wasn't happy when the woman at the desk saw me limping in, and had me stand there and fill out paperwork for ten minutes. A nurse in a wheelchair came out and wheeled me in to get it over with.\nAfter sitting for awhile and answering the usual questions, I was wheeled in to a room to wait for an X-Ray. I took out my phone to call mum to let her know where I was, and the woman at the desk immediately began snapping at me that there were no cell phones allowed in the room. Okay then.\nThen, nurses began flocking in to gawk at my foot. I'm not a freaking animal in a zoo, do not come in and stare in awe at the size my foot has swollen to and make me feel more like an imbecile for breaking it. \nAfter being stared at, I was wheeled in for Xrays and then taken to a room to wait for the doctor.\nShe came in pretty quickly and immediately began poking my foot with the \""Does this hurt?!\"" questions. Of course it hurts! Stop yanking on it repeatedly. After looking at Xrays and my foot, she informed she was unconfident in saying my foot was broken.\nDay later, a call back from the radiologist who wants to know if it's my hand or my foot, whether it's my left or my right, just left me feeling shocked and slightly concerned that they were unable to tell that in an Xray...\nGoing to the doctor the next day when she's open, it's broken in two places, which she pointed out clearly on the Xray I had picked up from Urgent Care.\nWhat. A. Joke. I would never come here again for a broken bone, but probably something they can't misdiagnose and send me home to suffer with."
0,Not a good service experience after the third time. They give preference to people who arrive after you and i would not reccomend going there. Terrible experience from the OWNER.
3,"Food was delicious, portions were great, and price was very reasonable! Highly recommend"
0,"I vow to never step foot into this mcdonald's again.  It is by far, the nastiest McDonald's I have ever visited.  \n\nWe went in today for an after school mcflurry.  The place smelled bad (think vomit) and it was dirty.  The upholstered chairs are in such bad shape that they have been \""repaired\"" with duct tape all along the entire bank of tables.  \n\nThis place gives me the creeps.  So long McDonald's.  I don't think I'll miss you."
1,"The place was super busy maybe that is why our food was really cold. Seemed like chicken was cold but the cheese was warm. Fries were completely cold. I would have loved to wait a little more for a better, warmer meal."
4,"I love it.  Point blank.  I came for my birthday on a 3 night comp... my room was gorgeous, the bathroom was fit for a queen, and the service was excellent.  Only one incident came up with room service taking over an hour, but to make up for it they took care of the bill.  The pool is to die for.  I wish I was still laying out having pitchers of mojitas delivered to me by bronze godesses... :(  so sad.  I miss you Caesars!"
2,"I have eaten at Hubbard several times. I am usually pleased with their food and service. It's not the food I have an issue with... it's the pie. Which is weird because that is what they are all about. I have had tried a few of their pies, and I'm not impressed. The worst one was the banana cream pie... that is the nastiest piece of pie I have ever had. The bananas were firm but slimy, like they had been coated in something to preserve them? I don't know, but the pie didn't have much flavor at all. The other pies I have tried are key lime, and I think it was a peanut butter cup one. The peanut butter cup chocolate one was ok, and the key lime again had no flavor. Your pies are pretty pitiful, which is pathetic considering that is what you all try to be famous for. I will continue to go back for the food but I'm pretty sure tonight's banana cream pie nastiness will prevent me from buying an over priced crappy piece of pie again!"
2,"Been giving this place the eyeball since it opened about a year ago but hadn't had a reason to stop in until this Tuesday. \n\nNot a bad place to shop if you're in need of Indian groceries and live on the east side of town. Dry goods galore - dal of every type, parathas, large quantities of basmati, jasmine, brown basmati rices. Spices were very reasonably priced (asafoetida at 1.50 for a large container, yay!) and there were a variety of jarred chutneys available (alas, no store-made). \n\nCouple of things that frustrated me: some staples come in large sizes only (ex: 5 pounds of lentils when you really need two) and no fresh breads on premises. The produce, too, was a little stale and wilty. But the freezers are full of all kinds of breads, entrees, delicacies. Awesome. Like Faith said, the staff is super helpful and talkative. This is also the only place in town that has a $1 samosa! Not the best on the planet but a pretty sweet snack. Yay!"
2,Ehh....just so so
1,I ordered the Athena pizza and I was very disappointed.  There was so much oil on the pizza.  The crust was soggy.
1,"The concept is great. Cheap groceries. A good selection of produce. Slam dunk right? Sadly, for me, it isn't.\n\nThis location is small (I havent been to others) and with everyone pushing around shopping carts, there is no room to walk around and grab the produce or items I need.\n\nThe prices are great, but the quality of the produce isn't the best. It's always hit or miss. A good example...Each morning, I squeeze myself a glass of orange juice from the market. Mariana's tends to be a tad cheaper than the ones at Food 4 Less, but the Mariana's oranges look like they are the red-headed step child of beautiful navel oranges. Bumpy, and they look abnormally large. I don't want steroids in my fruit or my baseball players. I don't even know if you can roid up fruit, but these oranges do NOT look natural.\n\nI'll pay a buck more for piece of mind. Oh yeah, and Food 4 Less is across the street."
2,"After reading the description I was excited to give this place a try.  I mean the name evokes memories of 70's Saturday Night Live skits, the menu is the ultimate in flexibility regarding toppings and they have over 50 ingredients for their shakes. They have been open at this location for 2 weeks now and there are the usual bugs in the service but nothing major. I ordered a Best of Both (Fries and Rings) and made a portabello, bacon, lettuce jack/cheddar and banana pepper burger).  The menu is truly flexible with tons of free toppings as well as the portabello which costs an additional 1.99.   We also tried the chicken fingers, watermelon tea and watermelon shake.\n\nThe onion rings were very good in a tempura type batter instead of the usual breading  The fries were overloaded with pepper and seasoning and neither myself nor my dining companion enjoyed them.\n\nThe shake was excellent and I would recommend the shakes to anyone who tries this restaurant.\n\nMy daughter enjoyed the chicken fingers and they were actually moist inside.\n\nThe burger was serviceable. The best part was the portabello, a nice bun size mushroom fresh and flavorful.  The bacon was crisp and the other ingredients fresh.  I ordered the burger medium and it came just the right pink inside.  Unfortunately, when I broke a piece off to try it without the ingredients, it was flavorless and tough in places,.  With the ingredients it was a good burger, I didn't love the bun but it wasn't bad either.  The burger just doesn't stand alone.\n\nThe deserts look great but we were too full so I will update the next time we go.\n\nOverall a good addition to the burger scene and hopefully the burger will improve."
0,"We walked into a nice atmosphere.  The hostess was nice, and our waitress was great.  The food was not good, and not worth the money they are charging.  The appetizers made no sense with the offerings on each plate.  We have eaten at some of the best restaurants on the east coast, California, and New Orleans (Commander's Palace for example).  Cork's offerings are way over-priced.  The duck was so salty I couldn't eat it, and they took the entree off the bill.  My wife also complained about her entree being too salty, but they did not take her plate off the bill.  Sex discrimination?  Maybe.  One thing is for sure.  We won't be going back, and we won't be referring any friends here."
2,"Some of my friends really like The Library. I think it is alright, but I'm still a little confused about what all they hype is about. NOTE: I have never been here for the food so take this review as a commentary on the bar scene part of it.\n\nWhat the Library does have going for it is a top notch draft beer selection and a great happy hour where you can get any draft for something like 3 dollars. The happy hour vibe is really good, not too crowded. The bartenders are also knowledgeable about the beers they sell.\n\nI don't really like The Library post happy hour. It starts getting really packed and the vibe is kind of confusing. The Library just doesn't seem like place where everyone is packed in. It sometimes feels like that scene in Star Wars where they are getting crushed in the garbage compactor on the Death Star.\n\nThe music choices often leave a lot to be desired.\n\nTo sum it up, the Library shines around happy hour times, otherwise it is just like any other South Side bar."
2,Good food restaurant was way too hot!!
4,Hello I bought a new spa a  week ago. From sunset spa and Larry the general manager was awesome I had look at 4 other spa dealers in the area but no one can beat sunset spa I had been saving for years for awhile for this and when I talked to Larry he gave a me a different price but asked could I buy it for a lower price he agreed I was really happy so if you are looking for a spa you really need to talk to Larry he is really nice and not pushy and he gives you the time u need for all the questions and trust me the other spa places will not give u the time it's like that don't care I was very frustrated that day until sunset spa.\n\nNow for the guys who bought my spa to me on Wednesday they were awesome to the guys gave me all the information I needed to use my spa they where great guys and again very nice. \n\nNow for service I thought my spa was not work so I called up sunset and told them I thought my spa was not heating right not even a hour later a guy name David came out he took off energy mode witch is where I had it set on put it on Stan mode and he was even nice enough to take time with explaining to me how to care for my spa and he even gave me his cell number and said and said to call him any time with questions he is hands down the best tech I have spoke to .\n\nSo if any of u reading this post know that ur getting the best spa and service that the state of AZ as to offer and the best price in town trust me I went to 4 others that day I thought getting a hot tub was going to be hard but trust me sunset made it easy and I got what I wanted and I never been so happy with the whole process.\n\nSigned \nA very very happy customer \n\nNo for
0,Coffee and pot of bread great....service is bad!!! Breakfast took 2 hours!!  Food was just ok. Had to ask for to go box twice and then it was thrown on table! Our bus person Jose was the nicest person there! Probably won't go back.
1,"I tried a slice of lemon cake; it tasted very artificial...kind of pinesol-ish. Definitely not homemade. I also tried a few cookies that were OK, nothing to get too excited about."
4,We ate there twice with very good experiences. Food was delicious with very friendly and accommodating service. A refreshing perk.
3,"The opening time is definitely a plus. We wondered by at 9:00pm and met a full house. Taste-wise it's just as it, I can't tell too much difference from other similar stores."
1,"Husband and I ordered a late breakfast. He had belgian waffle breakfast, I has the corned beef hash. \nThe bad: Corned beef hash was nothing special, tasted like the stuff you get out out a can. My hash browns were blond, rather firm, and possibly starting to turn bad... They had that slightly-off taste. My husband's scrambled eggs were watery (not runny, but surrounded by liquid). The belgian waffle was also cold by the time it came out... It had obviously sat in the window for a while while my food was bring prepared. \nThe good: fresh, hot coffee (they left the thermos pot on the table, which was nice), sausage links were fine, waffle was fine, my food was piping hot when it came out. \nThe total came to $26, which is more than the meal was worth, considering the poor quality of the breakfast food."
0,"Excellent appearance of completely tasteless food.  I went in pretty hungry and the large plate I got was really bland and the ingredients themselves appeared colorful, large and appetizing but Zero flavor!"
2,"I am re-reviewing Pink Box (only seems fair) since I had a much better experience this time around. I decided to give it a second shot because besides the service, I know their donuts are damn good. I got there around noon and to my delight, almost every donut was available. I bought half a dozen and they gave me to 2 free chocolate glazed donuts! I asked the employee what time they usually open and she said whenever she gets here and they close once they sell it. That was the only thing I still didn't like. But I am happy walking out with my Pink Box and a very happy 5 year old with two chocolate glazed with sprinkles donuts in hand (for free I might add again). I'm sure I will be back!"
1,"We signed up for this service at the recommendation of my neighbor who has also been using it for a while.  Signed up for the $40 box every other week.  They send you an e mail prior to the delivery to let you know what would be in your box and you have the option of substituting an item for another, for example if you don't want red kale you can get more broccoli.  They deliver it to your door and if you're not home leave a cooler outside.\n\nWe went through a few deliveries where we found that our neighbor who was getting the $30 box was getting the exact same amount of stuff than we were getting.  An oversight by the company and it was rectified, credits were issued. During the time we communicated to them via email we have gotten many out of office replies and explanations of \""system issues\"" which was the cause for some of the confusion about what we were supposed to receive.  We received blueberries with mold on them, it was corrected by giving us more red kale on the next order, not an even swap IMO.  The last box we received our neighbor who, again, receives the same box we get (we switched to the $30 box) had these HUGE bananas and much better quality produce than us.  I guess the secret to this service is to make sure you're not comparing your order to others near you\n\nHere's the deal.  This service is great, in principle.  Organic produce delivered right to your door, family owned business etc....but for what you're paying vs. what you get elsewhere.....you can gain a better value going to Trader Joes and picking out what you really want vs. what this service decides to give you.    In this day and age, it is essential for any business to be \""easy to do business with\"".  IMO everytime we had to touch this company or they had to touch us there was an issue."
0,These people are Scam artists. They quoted me 3 times the amount as everyone else and gave me a 4 week turn around. I took my car next store to metropolitan auto body and paint and they did it in two weeks and helped me with other damage with no extra charge.
2,"Not my favorite Cirque du Soleil... First, the seats that we had (on the side), although at the third row, didn't allow us to see the performance as a whole. The few acrobatics were impressive but very limited. The interaction with the public was good but maybe to much at times.\n\nIt's a good entertainment just not what I expected from the Cirque du Soleil."
3,"So, I went here because it had four and a half stars on Yelp. Would have never found this place on my own as it is tucked on a side street along the runway of the Scottsdale airport.  The food did not disappoint.  The bread was average, but the dipping sauce made up for it.  The only reason it did not get five stars is that it's wine selection is pretty limited.  Service was great, perfect for families."
2,"I bought a groupon to try this studio and style of yoga because my friend, Dray Gardner, is one of the instructors.  This style of yoga is challenging but a lot of fun. Dray is an amazing instructor.  I'd highly reccomend taking a class with him.  The studio is very nice looking, but there are several things about it that made me not want to purchase more classes once my groupon expired.\n\nFirst off, the locker rooms have no lockers.  All they offer are a few little unsecured cupboards for your belongings.  The shower curtain hooks are terrible because they're too small for the rod, thus the curtain doesn't easily glide open and close.\n\nThe studio has one large classroom that features three walls lined with mirrors, which is essential to yoga practice.  Typically, yoga studios have two mirrors, but three makes it a lot nicer.  Now, the biggest problem I have with the classroom is the floor.  It's laminate.  I understand that laminate floors are easy to clean, but topped with sweat and high humidity, it's extremely dangerous.  Before the start of my first class, Dray slipped and nearly fell as he walked into class.  The floor is starting to peel back in the back left corner.\n\nAll in all, Sumits style yoga is wonderful.  This studio just needs to reconsider some functionalities before I would consider returning."
3,"Like many others, I think this is one of the best boba spots in Vegas, if not the best. These are big words from me because I'm a huge fan of #1 Boba House (is that what it's still called?) inside the Chinatown Mall.\n\nFirst of all, the drinks are great. The staff is really nice and accommodating to any special requests you may have. This is something spectacular in terms of the boba world, at least in Vegas. Since most spots are in Chinatown - service is just unheard of. But not here. They're definitely onto something.\n\nI can't speak for their food, but for drinks this is just not even a question. Boba and service in one place - who would have thought? Now if only it wasn't so North..."
3,"I've been here twice and liked it both times.  I love that they have a live band during the evenings.  The last one was really good.  The food is decent as well--there aren't a lot of options for vegetarians and almost none for vegans, but you can find something I suppose.  It's located in the Village in Ballantyne, so that alone means its a pretty nice establishment.\n\nWait staff was friendly, outdoor seating was nice--overall, it's a nice place."
3,"The place has so much stuff going on! Aquariums, goldfish, crazy ceilings, etc. But when it comes to hand pulled noodles they're high in my charts.\n\nI had the chicken and mushroom sauced hand pulled noodle and it was so flavorful and the noodles were chewy and cooked to perfection. I loved everything about it, reminded me of korean jjajangmyun but more of a american gravy taste twist to it.\n\nMy friends had the chicken soup noodle dish and I can't remember if that was the correct name but it was so good!!!!!!! If you're hung over that is the ultimate soup!!! Just be ready for a nap afterwards!"
1,"The burgers are ok, shakes were good.\n\nThe reason I'm giving two stars?? Because as I am sitting here writing this, I notice the tables are not clean. The girl who is \""cleaning\"" the tables (Let me add her \""cleaning\"" consists of a swipe on the table with her rag, then leaves the rag on the table while she walks away to who knows where) is picking up the used plates, napkins, silverware, cups-and carrying them to the counter.  \nWhat's wrong with that you ask?? Well...she is carrying those dirty dishes to the front and putting them on the counter where they pack up your meals to go. Oh wait....it gets better...how sweet of her to leave those nasty dishes on that front counter, save time by NOT washing her hands, and kindly pick up your food order and deliver to the tables!\nNasty, just nasty!!"
3,"Let us check in at 9am, friendly staff.  Decor a bit old, but very clean.  Looking forward to our stay"
0,"This place is the worst customer service check out ever! It is  12:00pm Sunday and you only have two people ringing? Ok I'll give you maybe people call in sick. Me and 20 other people are in line waiting. Then your manager on duty is laughing and joking with another associate, as she gives her change. Noticing the line is getting longer you take your time laugh some more. With no one being helped nor being rung up. We are all still standing in line? Then after something is said both of you start to ring up again. With the manager still laughing. So sorry. I have been in retail for a long time totally unacceptable. I left my basket and the 300.00 worth of stuff I was going to buy there. The only good thing is the security officer, she welcomes you as you come in."
3,"Walked in to find this place DEAD (I guess Monday nights are slow...), so my friends and I got a table quick. \n\nOrdered a half dozen oysters to start. They could have been cleaned a bit better, I had more than a few with some serious grit in them. And I know there's always going to be SOME grit and sand, but this probably could have been remedied with another rinse or two. Good sauce accompanies it, though. Just be conservative with it, the oysters taste delicious on their own. \n\nI had the meatloaf. It didn't taste as good as my mom's (but, really, does it ever, people?) but it was actually better than I was expecting. A solid, well-formed loaf, not too spongy, nice firmness. Seasoning was mild, not too heavy as to take away the taste of the meat. \n\nIt came with green beans, which were extremely underdone. Better than overdone, but I found it odd they'd serve them like that; didn't complement the dish at all. I think it also came with mashed potatoes. The fact I can't remember likely means the other side dish was innocuous enough that it went down good but wasn't worth storing in my mind."
0,"Dr. Rumman is NOT a helpful doctor, and she doesn't answer all my questions. Her whole attitude at the hospital seemed arrogant and least understanding."
1,"Out shopping with my wife and it was lunch time. I have never been to On the Border so we stepped in and waited. There was many tables open but no one to set you. Finally someone came and seated us. Our waitress came soon after and we ordered. We had to wait to get our tea refilled. Service was slow and, (I just did not feel welcome).  I got a burrito I think my wife got the same. \nThe food was ok. Eatable. By no means great. In this area there are several very good Mexican Food restaurants. For this reason I have no reason to return to this one. I don't want to sound mean. The food was eatable ok food when you can get great food for the same price and the waitress acts like they are glad you are there. \nCHOW (purina)"
0,Bad attitude  never thought I would not go to a McDonald's  this one never go back. Always trying to up sell  please its fast food
4,"We just had a perfect meal at Anthony's. It was our first time there and selected this spot based on the great reviews. The reviews were right on the money. Impeccable service, white linen table cloths, and excellent food. I started with the mozzarella and tomato salad, then moved on to the bone in, New York steak. Wow! That steak was perfect in every way. I just had to pick up the bone and savor every morsel of tasty meat!  If you are not a penny-pincher, and you are looking for a quality spot to have a great meal, then this is a sure choice in Henderson."
1,"Ok this is no longer my favorite PTs. I would come here after work to relax and enjoy a drink. I don't have that same enjoyment of this place anymore.\n\nRewind back a few months. My bf and I came here one night for a few drinks. I order a Bellini, which is champagne and peach pur\u00e9e. The bartender Carla didn't know what that was and made this face like I was making up some absurd drink. It's a typical champagne cocktail! And plus you're a bartender, you're supposed to know your drinks. She knew what a mimosa was when I ordered it, she should have known what a Bellini was. Anyway, about 10 minutes later, my bf accidentally knocked over my drink shattering the glass on the floor. We thoroughly apologized and I understand that Carla was annoyed she had to clean it. \n\nNow fast forward to our visit last night. We order a beer from this one blonde bartender. Really nice and inviting. We were enjoying our time. Then Carla comes over and says to my bf \""do you want another beer?\"" Then he answered \""sure I'll take another one.\"" Then she replies with \""what is it?\"" Um rude!!! My bf said she probably remembered us from the glass breaking incident, which is why she have us attitude. Anyway, after that I was just in a fowl mood and we left shortly after. \n\nLooks like I won't be going to this PTs anymore. There's another one down the street from us so it's not like I'm going out of my way."
1,"This place really smelled bad, I wouldn't have stayed, however my friend was already eating her soup when I arrived. I did my best to get over the smell, I couldn't eat the soup, I ordered the lunch special red curry. It was really good, not as spicy as I would've liked, but not bad. I doubt I'll be back."
3,"I enjoyed a lovely brunch on the patio here with some GREAT companions for great conversation.  The eggs were great.  All the pastries I tried were divine.  The bacon was merely satisfactory.  The jelly with the \nmini donuts was AMAZING.  But, they need to stop calling those things beignets.   They were donuts, and by misnaming them I expected something different in terms of fluffiness of the pastry.  The Bellinis were awesome.  Wish they served coffee in bigger cups."
3,"Fun atmosphere, hidden hole-in-the-wall. Friendly employees. Pepperoni and meatball pizza was awesome."
4,"Maria is AMAZING! Super personable and excited to help. Got me in right away. Took her time and made me feel extremely comfortable. The office is clean and pretty. Blows miracle in progress out of the water, I will definitely be returning!"
4,"This is the best Starbucks I've ever been to. I just moved here from Alabama, and being a Starbucks fan I have been to A LOT of them, but this is my absolute favorite. All of the workers are so polite and sweet, and always doing their best to go as fast as possible. I've been going there every other day just about since I moved here a month ago, and today my debit card wasn't working so I was buying a sausage biscuit with what little cash I had, and the sweet cashier was like we're going to give you your usual drink too, no worries, it's on us. Wow, that was so kind. Also, once I had to wait a little bit for my biscuit so I went up to check on it, and they gave me a card for a free drink next time just for my wait. Super nice workers. No better customer service anywhere!"
0,I'm so upset with this salon. The people are nice but that's as far as the good points go. They did a horrible job on my nails and only discounted me $5! I probably would have considered going back if they didn't charge me for the mess they put on my nails. Nails didn't come out like I wanted them to at all. So disappointed. I won't be returning.
0,"Last Friday night my husband and I were able to try this place.  We say we want to eat there every time we go to the movies.  Well unfortunately,  IT WAS AWFUL...The counter where you make your meal was disgustingly dirty, my rice was watery and when I got my meal it looked like a bowl of mush....something you would feed a bunch of chickens. I had chosen a ton of veggies and fish,  well they destroyed it during the cooking process.  It looked awful and it tasted worse. I also spent the later part of my evening in the bathroom!  (not just me, hubby too) Never again will I eat at Genghis Grill...I actually thought about calling my bank and disputing the charge. This place is nothing short a high end really bad Chinese food restaurant, you know the  ind where you are eating and you know you will regret it later!!!!    YUCK YUCK YUCK...NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Never did anything like this before, a friend invited me as a birthday gift. Seriously the best night out in a loooong time!! I have NEVER painted in my life and I actually came away with a decent piece of work! \n\nThey have great food, the wine was great, and the service and teaching were excellent! I can't wait to do it again!\n\nGirls night, date night, or just for the heck of it, seriously try this, what a blast!!"

1,"Well, the Nachos were great. That's all the food we had, atmosphere was good.  Don't do the oyster shooters, canned oysters, not good!!!   The Tatuado Tequila shots we tried were bad, sort of tasted like vodka.  Some one there needs to taste that stuff, the bartenders didn't even know what it was supposed to taste like. The Margaritas were decent, have had a lot better though."

0,We went with high hopes. We were seated and waited 20 minutes (no exaggeration) without anyone coming to our table. We tried to get the attention of the waitress as she passed and she actually looked the other way. I We ended up leaving without even being able to try it.
3,"I've been here a few times for brunch and I've found it's kind of hard to go wrong. There is never a wait, you can pick if you want to sit inside or out, and there is usually a pretty fun crowd at all the tables. \n\nI've tried the breakfast burrito which is my favorite, it's hearty without being too gooey or stuffed. It's definitely a big meal, so expect to walk away full and ready for a nap. I've also tried the Doctor's Ordered eggs dish (which surprisingly flavorful for something that is considered healthy) and the Huevos Rancheros (which is good but too heavy for me). \n\nA few tips about this place: \n* Get a side of the potatoes, even if it doesn't come with your meal. They are SO good! \n* As always, I like to start my brunch off with an appetizer of a pancake (because I'm a fatkid) but theirs is not listed on the menu...just ask for it if you want one or an entire order. \n* This is going to sound weird, but they have great toast. The bread they use is thick cut and delicious...plus they have good jam options at the table. \n* The service is kind of hit or miss. I've had great waiters (he made me a tinfoil rose) and totally crappy ones (took our order, had someone else deliver the food, and then didn't come to check on us at all...as in we had to get up and go ask other servers for help), just giving you a heads up."
1,"I'm quickly falling out of love with this restaurant. On my most recent trip, I was treated to the new menu format: a huge piece of plain white paper that covers the table top. You have to turn your head sideways to read the menu, which is awkward and inconvenient. They also use your soy sauce bowl to hold the menu down because, for some odd reason, they store the menus rolled up. This would be fine if we hadn't gotten a previously used, grease stained menu.\n\nTheir iced tea and Diet Coke tasted off, as if the water was bad or the syrup ratio wasn't set properly. The Diet Coke was also flat. Our salad came quickly, and was immediately followed by the sushi-coordination problem? The ingredients in our rolls were sparse and not evenly distributed, and the rolls were cut into uneven pieces. The spicy tuna did not taste fresh.\n\nIt's no wonder that this is always our fallback when Sushi Red is busy. At least they haven't screwed up the seaweed salad...yet! I'm almost sure it comes prepackaged, so I'm not surprised."
0,"A very poor excuse for Mexican food.  We arrived at lunch to find the place packed and had a bit of a wait, which despite the run-down lackluster interior, we viewed the popularity as a positive sign that we were in for some great food.  We were finally seated and were provided with food-covered menus and a basket of chips and watery, flavorless salsa.  The waiter finally came over to take our order after a long wait at which time we also requested some silverware and napkins.  After another ten minutes, he finally brought us some water and some well used silverware rolled in a paper napkin.  One would have thought that with salsa so watery, they would have provided us with some plates to prevent dripping all over the table, but the overall lack of cleanliness of the place seemed to suggest otherwise.  The chips themselves were greasy and bland and we only consumed some of them because we were both famished.\n\nAfter another lengthy wait, my veggie burrito finally arrived. I only managed to get through a few bites of this greasy, flavorless disaster before calling it quits and heading back to the office still hungry.  The burrito consisted of nothing more than soggy, overly greasy, limp, overcooked vegetables, of which spinach was the predominant variety.  There was no flavor to any of it or any spice, sauce, etc. that would give one the impression of eating Mexican food.  I have absolutely no idea why people would flock to this place.  The atmosphere is that of a dirty cafe with tables packed on top of each other and the food is beyond horrible.  While I avoid fast food at all costs, I can honestly say that I would eat at Taco Bell before ever coming back to Frank & Lupe's."
2,"I found this place after doing some Google searches for watch repair in Pittsburgh. I had a really nice watch gifted to me a few years back, but I didn't find myself wearing it very much, as it was a little too big. Since it's 2012 and we all need to step our game up, I decided to have some links taken out of the watchband and replace the battery in the watch.\n\nI choose this place because, it was the most convenient location for watch repair that I could find. I took my watch in about an hour before the end of the day on Friday. I thought that the job could have been accomplished easily and quickly, but the owner told me I would have to come back the next day...\n\nA word of caution, my watch was wound and working and several links had been removed as promised. However, as I tried the watch on I noticed that one of the pins was not in place properly. It just seemed a little off center. If an untrained eye could note this, a master watchmaker certainly should have been able to do the same. Had I not noticed this, my very expensive watch would have most probably met with a most untimely demise as it plummeted towards the nearest sidewalk. The owner was quick to fix this error, but did not seem very apologetic.\n\nThe price, $20, was fair and the work acceptable in the end."
0,"1 Oak? I think this should be called 1 Blow.\n\nGrrrr. Memorial Day weekend. Saturday night. We get into line for 1.5 hours starts at 10:00PM. The line was REALLY long, but we waited patiently anyways. There is a ladies line which they dump in there, but the general line takes forever!! When we got up to the front, the line completely stopped, for about 20 minutes. The staff never acknowledged us, only said it stopped but it would be starting back again. We then found out that there was ANOTHER line to get in.\n\nMy friends were already inside and had told me it wasn't worth the wait, it was ghetto, the beers were $10, the cocktails were $20, the free drink tickets they give you in line for 'liking' them on FB expire at midnight. I wouldn't be able to tell you how good the inside is, but the line outside sucks, and from what I hear, we're not missing out on much. Don't waste your time - this club is wack."
3,"A Vegas MUST if it is your first time. Romantic and inspiring.. the jets shoot so high into the air, it is amazing! \n\nThere is a bar inside the Bellagio.. Fontaine that has a great terrace to view from and if you are wanting to fine dine with a view of them, it is Picasso!"
2,"Okay. Glad there are other reviews posted for White Rabbit Fusion Cafe already. I been holding off on posting a review for it since it, well it did not exactly wow the F out of me. And 3 stars is the best they can get out of me with their soft opening effort.\n\nBut first let me just explain what White Rabbit Fusion Cafe is to those not familiar with this food truck from California turned brick and mortar LV restaurant.  It is Filipino comfort/street food proteins (Chicken Adobo, Pork Sisig, Pork Longanisa, etcetera.) packaged in traditional Mexican food delivery vessels (i.e., your tacos, burritos, quesadilla).\n\nThe portion is just underwhelming for me, but I can pack a lot of food away, so I am biased.  But they have Tofu on the menu for vegetarians.  The concept of someone  ordering something vegetarian at a Filipino Fusion place is just so foreign to me.  But it is available.\n\nPricing seems high to me for what you get.  The fact that it is in or near one of the busier plazas in the \""Chinatown District\"" makes their pricing strategy suspect.  If it was something served from a food truck at FoodieFest,I can see the reasoning behind the carnival-like pricing, but not such a great incentive from a brick and mortar operation.  I know, it does not make sense, but I stand by my opinion.\n\nThe cashier, even though this was her first job ever, was nice.  The order was prepared quickly and correctly, which is expected but still nice.  My Pork Sisig Burrito had a good ratio of pork sisig to rice ratio, but was on the dried side.  Portion seems to be designed for a growing 5 year old or someone on a weight loss plan.\n\nStill just a 3 star-ish experience overall for me. But I will chalk it up to their Pork Sisig not being as good as I had expect it to be, and give them another chance trying something else from their menu on a future visit."
1,"Recently I was in NOLA for a few weeks and lived in FLA for 2 years and I do know good Cajun food and alligator. I was cookin' with Paul Prudhomme back in the early 80's before he was Chef Paul P! \nFor almost $50 we bought the combo plate with two meats and sides, a shrimp Po' Boy and an order of (3) Beignets with sweet tea. The Po' Boys are very good. The Shrimp was lightly battered and well seasoned, fried golden brown, sweet and crispy with just the right amount of spice. The roll was fresh and crusty. The red beans and rice were very good - lots of meat, beans were toothsome (not mushy) and the rice was done just right and it was spiced perfectly. The french fries were good, fresh, hot and crispy brown and moist on the inside.The sweet tea was just right and freshly made. Unfortunately - The alligator is terrible and the Boudan balls are just plain horrible. Alligator consisted of tiny breaded balls of flavorless chewy meat ranging from the size of a pea to a large blackberry - not one chunk or strip mixed with a lot of debris from the fryer (fried crumbles of batter). They were mostly tough and chewy. This is supposed to be tail meat which is usually pretty tender and there was very little or no seasoning. The Boudan balls were a huge disappointment. The filling was an unidentifiable tasteless gray paste with very little powdered spice, rolled in bread crumbs and fried. I pulled one apart and could see not one piece of meat, vegetable or rice. My best guess is that it consisted of bread crumbs with powdered spices and some binder (don't have a clue what). That they call this a \""meat\"" selection is really a joke and for the price, absurd. When I was in NOLA I had Boudan balls at a half dozen different restaurants and they all contained meat, liver, ground with pepper/celery/onion/garlic, spices and rice . I've made my own for years and these resembled nothing like anything I've ever seen. There was no tartar or other sauce for dipping.The beignets are tough and chewy instead of the moist ,airy,  delectable powdered treat they are supposed to be like I had every morning at the Cafe Du Monde in N'Orleans. The combo plate contents and two of the three beignets now resides in my refrigerator, barely touched and will go into the garbage tomorrow....what a waste of money. If I wasn't so far away, I'd bring it back and explain why to the manager. So, if you go - which you should as there IS good food to be had, stick to the Po'Boys (NO ALLIGATOR!!!), gumbos, rice, fries and other selections. I will go back and stick to the above mentioned selections as they are the only option in this area for Cajun food. On VA s'revoir!"
3,"I've been going to Darque Tan on and off for about three years now. This location keeps a nice, clean store and offers about 20 beds of varying intensity levels. I usually use a level 2 bed which carries a max of 20 minutes and gives me a nice color.\n\nI went in today to buy a new package after taking a 6 month hiatus from tanning, and the sales associate was incredibly helpful. She took her time pulling about five bottles of lotion off the shelves and explaining all their different qualities and price points; she was very knowledgeable and I really appreciated her doing that. She didn't just pressure me in to buying the most expensive lotion they offer. \n\nDarque Tan offers monthly memberships as well as pre-paid packages; I use the $33.88/month package that allows for unlimited tans in level 1 and 2 beds at any DT location.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give five stars is because their lotions are pretty pricey. I bought a \""middle of the road\"" lotion with bronzers and DHA properties and it ran me $92, but they are offering a special right now that purchasing a lotion gives you money credited back to your account for upgrades."
4,"I heard about Debbie Downey from one of my stylists who saw a special she was having on endermologie, 3 sessions for $45 each. I have been intrigued by this treatment and have always wanted to try it out. What is endermologie you ask? Well the pamphlet states: the first worldwide, patented, FDA cleared process scientifically proven to reduce cellulite. What I say is....awesome! \nI have a gym membership that I hardly ever use, it is so hard to motivate to work out when I am on my feet working 6 days a week on average at least 10 hours a day. Now I had been thinking about getting weekly massages to pamper myself and help keep muscle soreness and tiredness at bay. But instead I am now getting the endermolgie treatments because it offers so much more than just a massage. It helps with detoxification, circulation, cellulite reduction, body sculpting, skin tightening and feels like a deep tissue massage. \nI love it! I bought the first 3 and then bought a package of 10. To be honest though I know it will be a weekly service for me. One of the problems I have been experiencing this past year is my hip joints will start to hurt after so many hours on my feet. Since I have started having Debbie work on me weekly, I don't get that pain even remotely like I use to. I have also already noticed a difference in my body, my hourglass shape is more defined. My stomach is flatter, my skin tighter, my buns are a bit more lifted. A girlfriend of mine gave me a booty slap and said, \""Damn girl! Have you been working out? Your ass feels great!\"" True story.... \nDebbie herself is wonderful and always works with me and my hectic schedule. I instantly felt her kindness and already consider her not only a service provider but also a friend."
2,"I was asked what I want for dinner tonight, I say Mexican. Okie Dokie then, where? I say Manuel's since we have never been, Okie Dokie then.\n\nSo we arrive and are greeting by three people and taken directly to a booth, which for me is strike number one. I hate booths my body is just not made for them. But there seems to be no tables. I assume the interior is meant to feel like an outside courtyard, it does not in the least feel as such. I am truly over the open duct work look.  But it is clean and not overpowered with music, and thank God no TV's. So we are then greeted by our waitperson, Patches. Yes her real name, I asked. Most wait persons could learn a thing or two from her, very friendly but not over familiar and patient in answering any question and making sure you understand the menu and what comes on the dish. I watched her take the same care with all of her quests, but not letting the attention delay her service.\n\nNow on to the food. I did not like the chips and salsa, to me the chips tasted like cardboard and the salsa had cilantro. I do not like cilantro and if I am aware it will be in the dish; ask that it be left out. I had the tacos with pork. I liked this a lot, the meat was tender and very flavourful the cilantro on this comes in a separate bowl. My mate had the sampler plate; he did not like the food at all. He said it had a hint of flavour and that would be the same flavour for each sample. So he was not impressed. I doubt we will be back as there are other places as close to our home we like better."
3,"Came during thanksgiving and boy was it slow.  I've come before for champagne brunch with friends and that was a 5 star affair, this time it was a 3, so i'll meet in the middle at 4.\n\nPrime rib is great here and the crab legs are typically pretty good and cut in half already for you.  Crab legs arent old or anything (or still frozen) and they have taste to them unlike bad ones you get that are dry or flavorless.  Prime rib was served and cut perfectly medium rare. \n\nThe variety of japanese sushi stuff is pretty weak, and the chinese is just okay.  I do enjoy the cheese/meat area though and some of the other seafood and bbq choices are okay as well.  I'll be back on a brunch morning :)."
0,I wish I had not hire them. The way they cut my grapefruit tree allowed the sun to kill it. Now I have a dead tree. Not worth the money.
0,"We were visiting from Chicago and called ahead to see if they took reservations. We were told Sundays were slow so we headed on over.  The  first thing I noticed was the waitress and hostess dressed in very short shorts and skimpy tops..on to the service....very slow. We waited quite a long time for a waitress. We asked if the appetisers could please come before dinner. They came at the same time, after a long wait. I have to have gluten free and the one gluten free appetiser was stuffed mushroom. The cheese wasn't melted entirely and it was cold in the center.  Wings weren't anything special.  We had to wait a long time to get our check which was pretty pricey.  To be honest the staff are very low energy and don't seem to care about their work. Whomever is doing the hiring may wan to consider work ethic and intelligence rather than cup size.\n  Also, I am not feeling well and I think I may have been given gluten.\nAfter reading some other negative reviews for this restaurant I wonder if the owners read their Yelp reviews."
4,This is really cool. It's a nice lil' hike and adventure to take when visiting the viewpoints and natural history of the Phoenix area. \n\nBest to visit at sunset!
0,"We stopped coming here, there are just too many Large Dogs roaming leash-free with little or no supervision. I reported to Animal Control and Park Police. Large dog poo all over the place too. We now drive extra 10 mins to a park in Seven Hills, much much better well kept park with more Respectable dog owners."
1,"Over priced on just about everything in stock. Seriously why would I pay almost $6 for a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream? Also the staff can be very rude at times and seem like they do not want to deal with certain people who shop there, kind of made me feel like I was not wanted. \n\n\nI am always looking for a good bargin but this place has some of the weirdest policies when it comes to their sales. I can not stand when they over price their meat so that they can make it look like you are getting a good deal when they advertise a \""sale\"". \n\nSeriously since when does a pack of pork chops cost almost $15? Or 2 thin little steaks almost $18? All they do is take a pack of meat, mark it up 2 or 3 times the price and say it is buy one get one free. They move more product and still make a good amount of money. They are not the only ones doing this but they are doing it almost every week!! No wonder this place is always so empty!\n\nWhile they do have a larger selection of some items it is not enough to get me to shop here regularly."
1,"Their soups are GREAT! The service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot. The employees are kind of a \""grunge\"" crowd. However, last time I went, I got food poisoning. I would say eat there, but the food is the only good part about it. Good selection of beer, wine...not at all."
0,"First, you have to be transferred to so many people before finally someone can understand an issue. I have had service to my water heater and to my air conditioning. The water heater guy was a complete cocky a**hole, not only called 10 minutes before the last possible time he could be here (they told me between 9-12p) and said it'll be another hour or so, no apology. Once he arrived, he said I needed a whole bunch of \""up to code\"" stuff. When I checked with other companies, they said I didn't need all that. Air Pro had to do the install per home warranty, but I got the un needed charges that I was told by the water heater guy that I \""needed\"" off, it was $120 worth of stuff not covered by home warranty. The comment by Maggie about the \""required\"" disposal for $180 also was told to me, when I looked into it, I found out it's not required and I can do it myself.\nThe man that came out for the a/c was very nice and helpful, no problem with the a/c worker.\nI have a new issue with my AquaTherm system, something that works with my water heater to keep my house warm....something I obviously won't need to have run in the Summer....but it has been running,and gas bill is 3x what it should be, so I called my home warranty company and they sent the same a**hole from AirPro that installed my water heater. So unprofessional, he said \""who installed that water heater, cause they did a good job\"". I didn't find it funny. He just looked at the AquaTherm and said there is nothing wrong with it, and he doesn't work on those, so I'll need to call the home warranty company back and Air Pro will need to send someone that works on the air conditioning, because it's those people who work on the AquaTherm....so that's what I did. I explained very clearly that it is not the a/c and not the water heater, but my AquaTherm system that needed repair, and I'm no tech, but my AquaTherm works with my water heater, so why does someone who works on a/c need to repair it? So Air Pro sends another person who can't fix it and they tell me it is a plumbing issue and they will have to call and schedule that.....who knows what issue it will be next, but this system running is costing me money each day and the people at Air Pro don't seem to care or want to help."
3,Our service was great!! I Like the salad alot but they are going to take out the menu.. Not sure why....
0,"New Years Eve at the Bank was oversold. It was a nightmare and an accident waiting to happen. The light group promised me a refund right after the event which I have still not received.  We paid $330 for two people, waited until 11:40 in line for a show that started at 10, and then we were let into a club in which you could not move an inch in any direction. I actually had a 50 somethings breast in my face and could not move to remove them. I couldn't get to the bar to get a drink nor to the railing to even catch a glimpse of Bruno. This was suppose to be a fairy tale night for my husband and I. It took us 10 minutes to push our way out of the club, ripping my purse in the process. It was truly scary and I am not a woman who scares easily. This was billed as an intimate evening with Bruno  Mars. I am not so naive that I thought it would be intimate, but it was so crowded it was unsafe. I am not claustrophobic, and usually I enjoy the energy of a crowd. Someone should make this right. I feel Like we were scammed."
0,Very pricey for what you get. Only ok service. Sometimes staff is a bit rude.
4,"This was by far the most amazing birthday evening ever.  \nFirst off, this place is not for the financial faint of heart.  At $150 a plate, it is on the high end of meals I have ever had.  So would I do it again?  We booked our next evening before we left.\nThe tasting menu was an epic event.  Course after course of quality dishes that superseded the previous.  Topping things off with the best custard dish that I've ever had.  \nThe staff was amazing.  Friendly, involved, attentive and just great folks.  They even gave my wife a birthday card signed by the entire staff.  Talk about attention to detail and really serving the guests.  \nIf you like sushi, you will love this place."
1,"Had you asked me to write the review after my first visit I would have given three stars.  Now that we have been back for a second stop, it has dropped to a 2 star experience. \n\nBiggest plus - the chips are hot fresh and the salsas are tasty.\n\nHowever, the entress are just a soupy mess of sauce, beans, rice and whatever you ordered.  It seems they plate the food, then throw it under a broiler or heat lamp to perfectly melt everything into one congealed mess.  Flavor is jsut ok, as the two stars say, \""meh, I've experienced better.\""\n\nStill on the quest for a better upscale Mexican Dinning experience.  Somewhere where they rice and beans are not one big mess covered in sauce and sour cream.  Somewhere where they take the time to plate a nice plate of food."
2,"Been here twice... the selection seemed about the same... but not so sure. \nIt's like walking into an aunt's house. The workers there are friendly, speak Tagalog to you right off the bat, even if you don't speak it (good or bad? Hmmm) and make sure you're ok for the most part.\nI like the pork gisantes they have, and the pancit is pretty tasty! At $7.99/ person there's not much to complain about. They also sell other goodies and snacks at the register.\nProbably will be back with the fam soon.\n\nHonorable mentions:\nPusit\nDiniguan (dinardaraan)\n\nOhh, parking is somewhat odd. One way only, so make sure you take the correct entrance! Although the lot is small, I usually find parking right away!"
1,Stopped here for some drinks after a wonderful dinner so this is a drinks only rating.  The place is kind of divey which is fine.  I like a good dive. The bartenders both a litle odd. My drink ws okay but its hard to screw up a captain and diet.  My friends drinks were awful.  They kept trying to add stuff to it to make it better.   Probably would skip this place next time.
1,"I'll make this one an easy read. \n\nI have been to this steakhouse 4 times since it has opened. The 1st time being within it's 1st month, the last several weeks ago.\n\nMy 1st 2 visits were awesome, great steaks and sides and good service, then something happened on my 3rd trip about 1 1/2 years ago, the food was just o.k. not horrible but nothing that great. Well a few weeks ago we were back at the Venetian.  I was there with my Wife, 2 sons(16 and 5) and my Sister in Law, everyone wanted steak, so we decided why not let's try Delmonico's.\n\nTurns out this was a bad choice and one that will keep me from going back, with all the new crops of good steakhouses(many within the same hallway) that have popped up since this place has opened, Delmonico's needs to get it's act together.\n\nWe ordered 3 Rib Eyes, 1 Filet, and my 5 year old got a burger. For sides truffled potato chips, mashed potatoes and corn.\n\nWhen we were sat, we immediately were served water and our drink orders taken, that was the highlight of the meal. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and orders taken. When we asked if they had anything specific for our 5 year old, they suggested the burger, fine he can have that, if not my Wife would have just split some of her filet with him\n\nWhen our food came about 50 minutes later, mind you the place had just opened and there were no more than 4 other tables occupied. They put all our food down in front of us and they then proceeded to give my son a burger that had to have been at least 12 ounces, we all looked at each other and then commented on how and why would they serve him that.  Mind you, waiter suggested this burger for the 5 yr old.\n\nBack to the other plates, it was just large chunks of flavorless meat, the sides were bland and the truffled chips were soaking in oil. When it was all over and done we had been there almost 2 hours and were out almost $300. I have no problem spending good money for a good meal, but this meal left us feeling like we had wasted our time and our money.\n\nWill not go back."
0,I've been here twice (because after my first time I didn't want to go back but decided to give it another try). Both times they were slow behind the counter (trying to be like a Chipotle) and the food was just not enjoyable at all. Would rather go to Chipotle or Qdoba.
3,"This is the place you wanted to find the last time you did a road trip theouh Iowa or Kansas. Just plain good home cooking. A simple decor, friendly waitresses, and a good cup of joe when you need it. Prices are reasonable and the parking is plentiful. By the way they offer some cute gift item; yeah, very reminiscent of the Midwest."
4,"From check-in to check-out, Sanctuary Spa provides the ultimate spa experience. When it comes to my spa days, I like to choose wisely because I save my funds very carefully to treat myself to a spa experience. Because I save my pennies so carefully, I want an A+ experience at the spa I choose. Sanctuary gets an A+. \n\nI am going to be very detailed in my review, because when I'm looking for a spa I want to know every little thing about the spa. You will notice that the Sanctuary does an excellent job with the little extras that make a spa experience that much better. \n\nSetting:\n\nThe Sanctuary Spa is nestled on the base of Camelback Mountain. You enter through a plush neighborhood of beautiful houses and walk past state of the art tennis courts before entering the spa. I would call this spa intimate and state of the art. Yes, I've been to bigger spas, but bigger isn't always better. I opened the doors of the spa and entered a small check-in table where the staff greeted me with smiles and charm. They had me give them my CC upon arrival so that I wouldn't have to stop by and pay on my way out if I was in spa-mode. After check-in, they led me through double doors where two more spa attendants waited to give me a tour of the locker room and key to my own locker room. \n\nLadies Locker Room \n\nThe ladies locker room has everything I look for in a spa. It has a vanity area with lotions, hair spray, shaving gels, and several other products to use while getting ready. The bathrooms are spacious and offer mouth wash and disposable tooth brushes and toothpaste for use throughout the day. The private walk-in showers are also spacious and provide shampoo, conditioner, body wash and razors. The individual lockers offer a robe, flip flops and a towel. The jacuzzi is pretty small but on the quiet day I visited, it was just the right size. The waiting room for services is intimate but again, just the right size. They have hot tea, ice cold water, almonds and dried cranberries for guests to enjoy throughout the day. The ladies locker room provides the perfect setting for a relaxing day. \n\nThe Gym \n\nWhen I do spa days, I like to take full advantage of every amenity they offer. After all, I am paying a pretty penny so I want to get my money's worth! I tend to visit the gym first because then I feel even better going into my spa day. This gym is definitely a nice one. They offer complimentary water and Gatorade at the gym. The treadmills overlook a lap pool through large floor to ceiling windows so it's easy to day dream while you workout. The treadmills have TVS and complimentary disposable head phones just in case you forgot yours. They also have ellipticals, weights, bikes and offer a variety of fitness classes throughout the day. \n\nThe Pools \n\nI would say the spa lap pool is the only downfall (in my opinion) at the Sanctuary. During my spa days, I like to enjoy a tranquil pool that's not \""in the scene.\"" I like to saunter out there before and after treatments, lay out and relax. The Sanctuary spa does offer access to their two pools, but one is a lap pool without much \""spa\"" ambiance to it. It's more just like a workout pool with some lounge chairs. The other pool is the stunning negative edge infinity pool in the main hotel area. The pool itself can't be beat and sits against a backdrop of the desert and palm trees. It was beautiful, but it was also in the middle of the action, so it made my spa day a little more rambunctious than I was hoping for. However, the pool itself was beautiful and I've definitely seen wilder pools. Just be prepared to be in the scene if you go. \n\nThe Services \n\nNow let's talk services. I will say that my two technicians might be my favorite of all my spa experiences in the Valley: Sherry especially. Sherry gave me my Sanctuary Jewel facial which is a 50 minute facial that's customized to your skin. From the moment I met Sherry, she was so incredibly nice and made me feel at ease. She's Southern and her Southern friendliness definitely was in full force! Now, getting a facial can be nerve-racking because you are letting someone examine every flaw on your face. It's important that your technician makes you feel comfortable during the facial. Not only did Sherry make me feel comfortable, but she found traits to compliment me on throughout the facial and did it in a truly genuine manner. Not only was she nice, she gave me an amazing facial! I left with my skin glowing and my confidence still intact! For that I will continue to visit Sherry for facials. \n\nI had my massage done by Tara who did such a good job, I nearly fell asleep! Now be prepared for them to try to upsell you on products before the massage. That was the only downfall, but it's not the massage therapists fault for doing what they are told to do! I didn't add any extras, but the regular Swedish massage was all I needed!"
0,"Worst pho I have ever had!  The waitress was soooo nice though.  She offered me another kind, but it was bland too.  I love pho and I have it all over the valley.  My husband and I came here to try it due to all the reviews, but honestly we hated it.  We ended up leaving and going somewhere else for good pho.  The pho here was tasteless, T)the broth had no flavor or aroma.  It was like hot water with noodles in it and two shrimp and one scallop.  My husband had the beef pho and I had the seafood pho.  His was just as bland.  The waitress then brought me a bowl of egg flower soup to try and it was the same way.  Even the summer rolls were a disapointment.  They didnt even come with peanut sauce but hoisin sauce instead and they tasted bland too.  I cant say enough about how kind the waitress though.  She was very understanding and apologetic."
2,"Went to Beso with a co-worker while at a trade show. It was a Monday night and the place was about 80% empty so ambiance didn't feel great. On the plus side, the restaurant has a great view of the water fountain/main entrance at Aria which is cool at night.\n\nThe food was solid, but not spectacular. The friend calamari appetizer was really good but my petite filet steak was just average. In addition I had ordered it with the blue cheese crust but they forget to serve it with it. When I pointed it out, they just threw some melted blue cheese on top. Not impressed. I ordered the herb fries as my side dish and they were pretty solid I must admit.\n\nOverall, I would say that Beso was fine but I think you can find better steak places."
0,"Gym is very rundown, machines are dusty doesn't seem like they ever clean it, bathroom smells a little funky,  like their sewer pipes has issues... the female staff working the front desk are friendly,  however the guys dont greet you because they're to busy hanging out with their friends. I also notice that the guys are always letting their friends in without signing in, assuming they even have a membership.  Even more annoying they let them dribble a basketball all around the gym..\n\nThey also raised my membership,  no reason given, obviously the money is not going back into the gym. \n\nHighly considering moving back to LVAC, only thing holding me back is, this location is behind my home"
3,"I do not like to drink coffee or (most) coffee related drinks, but Coffee Rush has some great alternatives!\n\nMy wife, my best friend, and I like to write comic book and movie scripts together and we usually do this late at night at Coffee Rush.  They serve coffee until 11pm (which is great because it gives us a chance to get there and spend some time) and they stay open until 12am so you don't have to leave right at 11pm.\n\nI usually get a 20oz. Black & White Frost (something my wife introduced me to) and I always look forward to it.  It is one of their blended drinks with ice, milk, white chocolate, coffee.  It's pretty perfect.  Depending on my mood, I'll get whipped cream on top or not - depends on the day.\n\nMy best friend gets their hot chocolate (which I have also had on cold evenings) and it is well made.  I always prefer a little more chocolate than most places put into their hot chocolate, but when I've asked for a little extra chocolate they have always accommodated me without delay.\n\nThey also have a few extra non-coffee drinks like Deadly Soda and assorted Italian sodas.\n\nYou can access their free wi-fi with the purchase of a drink.  Since we purchase three drinks (my wife, my best friend, and myself) we are always able to get three wi-fi passes.  The passes are good for three hours of access to their Internet and, if you're there for more than three hours, you should probably buy another drink to get another pass and stop being cheap.\n\nWe never sit outside on the patio because it seems like everyone out there smokes and I can stand smoke.  It would be really nice to be able to sit out there some evenings, but I never can because of the smoking.  Inside is nice enough though (every locations is pretty much the same on the inside) and the smoke from the patio doesn't bother me inside.\n\nI always get my Coffee Rush card stamped when I go in and it adds up pretty quickly for a free drink.  They are always good about taking care of you when you get to your free drink and never give you any trouble about it.  They seem genuinely pleased that you've come back so many times.  Mondays are \""double punch\"" nights so stop in for 2-for-1 punches!"
0,"I had such high hopes for this place because of the high reviews, but i was sadly disappointed, my pho dac biet arrived so clear i could see all the way to the bottom of the bowl, i had never had pho broth that was extremely clear i feel like they just gave me a bowl of salt water with noodles and beef in it...after i got done eating i felt like i had a belly full of seawater. This is the second pho place i have tried and will not be back, i recommend jenni pho instead."
3,"I live in the Southwest part of Las Vegas and I usually find anything I need here. It takes a lot, something like red velvet pancakes, to make me venture out into another part of town. The possibility of trying red velvet pancakes made my friends and I wake up at 8 am on Presidents Day, drive about 40 minutes to Summerlin, and wait 45 minutes to get a table.  Despite all of that, I would do it all over again just to get a taste of those wonderful pancakes.\n\nMy two girlfriends and I shared these three menu items:\n\nRed Velvet Pancakes - yes, it lives up to the hype. The full stack came with 6 pancakes. The pancakes tasted like flat cupcakes and they are to die for. It was the right amount of sweetness. You may expect the whipped cream, chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup to be overwhelming but everything was just right.\n\nRick's Adobo Fried Rice - Adobo chicken is a traditional Filipino dish so my expectations were a little high on this dish. It came with fried rice with shredded chicken wrapped in egg like an omelet. It was very tasty and flavorful. We didn't really dig the macaroni salad. Someone was a little too liberal with the pepper.\n\nSpam Scramble - this was the only dish we didn't care for. It tasted as simple as it sounds... Spam with scrambled egg. I guess we just expected something different. This was something anyone could make at home and make it better.\n\nIf I were only rating the red velvet pancakes, I would give Babycakes Caf\u00e9 5 stars, hands down. I love the pancakes so much that I would make the drive out there again on my day off just to get a taste of them again."
2,"Of all of the Cirque shows I have been too, this one was my least favorite. I guess it depends on what part of Cirque you like...me personally..I like the crazy acrobatic stunts and the tumbling. This show was more storyline centric though. Frankly there were times during the show where I was just bored and waiting for something exciting to happen. That's never been the case for me at any other Cirque shows.\n\nThe theatre was pretty sweet though, and there was actually some audience interaction by the actors, which was pretty cool. Also the whole stage setup and props were just AMAZING. I've never seen a rotating stage like that before. Pretty damn awesome."
1,I'm agreeing with Krsna on this one.  I don't get it.  The fountain is a chocolate fountain.  Are people really that impressed that it's in the book of world records?  \n\nThe Bellagio room had no coffee pot so this was close to the elevator bank.  $4 for a cup of coffee??  And it wasn't good either.  Ridiculous.  \n\nThe line set up here is so wonky and stuffed with tourists that don't know what to do and keep staring at that stupid fountain.  Move on and find somewhere else - and I guess take a picture of the world's largest chocolate fountain if you MUST
3,It was nice. The cashier was chipper. The food was just like the L&L in Oahu. Wish they would crank the A/C a little more though.\n\nRestroom was a little dirty.
0,its 6 month's later  and i still hate this resturant ... i want my money back plus the day i wasted at the excalibur..... this place is a EPIC FAIL
4,If you need to have a sleep study done this is the place to have it done. With 5 sleep centers throughout the valley there was a sleep center not far from where we were staying. The facility is absolutely beautiful.The rooms are like a resort with the staff as nice as can be and very knowledgeable.  My daughter had the best experience here.
0,"This place used to be good... About a year or more ago. It seems to me they have changed ownership or management or something. The food quality is bad now. They have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon. The bacon used to be crispy and thick not it couldn't be more thin and under cooked. They give you a huge plate with two items on it and it makes it look like they forgot part of your meal. I've tried everything here. Nothing is good. \n\nI had the sausage and hash browns. The hash was undercooked (despite asking for it to be crispy). The sausage was cold. Seems they put it onto the griddle frozen and it didn't cook all the way or something. The pancakes alone are okay. The thing about pancakes, waffles and French toast are they are only as good as their syrup. Well the syrup is the cheapest tasting syrup substitute I've ever had. You can taste the sugar/ corn syrup in it. It has no smoky or mapley flavor to it (not even fake flavor). \n\nService is fine. Nothing to get excited about. Maybe 3/5 stars. The food is just so horrible that it brought the rating down that much. \nMy family and I have decided we will not return unless there are no other options. My warning is just because you had it before doesn't mean it is close to the same. I mean there wasn't even a piece of orange or parsley or melon on my plate like there usually is when you order breakfast at any other breakfast place"
4,"I love this place. Great for eating in or taking out. Lunch is a great price and a good variety, but empties out fast.\n\nWhat keeps me coming back? Best pad thai I've ever had, hands down. They'll spice it up or down depending on your tolerance. I've only ever gone up to three scoops, but have known other to push to six."
3,"Great little Italian place.  Very small dining area, so a long wait.  The food was good.  The arrabiatta was actually spicy which is rare here since most places dumb it down for the general population.  Service was good.  A solid 4 star place."
2,"Stopped by on our way home from Vegas. The food was good, I actually like their sauce better than Boiling Crab (LA). However, the waitress def could not explain the spice levels to us, they way she talked about the food made me not order as much as I normally do. She basically said the Cajun fries are too hot, and to order the mild sauce because the medium is too hot for her. This was after I told her I like spicy foods. I def could of gone for the medium sauce, and I probably would of tries the Cajun fries if she didn't dissuade me from getting them. Not a great way to sell your product! Would of given then 4 Stars but they made one of my friend chicken wings instead of fried shrimp, it took foreeverrrr for it to get corrected and they still handed is a bill with the chicken wings (their mistake). Would go back but they need to work on their service."
2,"Decent place, came here for the happy hour, wine was OK and the happy hour selection was average.  The wine choice could have been more inspired, as it favored the full bodied sweet reds, only one of the choices was to my liking: a fairly dry Pinot Noir.\n\nI had the Kobe beef sliders, meh, my buddy talked them up like they were the best shit on earth, but I would have preferred White Castle."
2,"Good food and prices, but nothing that surprises. I could not taste any wood in the barbecue. The ribs were fall off the bone, and the cole slaw is excellent. I thought the staff very pleasant. If you are in Anthem, this is a reasonable place for a decent, reliable lunch."
0,"We ate at this restaurant recently. We were very excited for Cuban food. My wife ordered the Mimita's Minuta or breaded tilapia sandwich. The fish was very old and disgusting. The waitress was very nice and brought her a Tamal Cubano instead. Unfortunately it had all the flavor and consistency of microwaved cheese food. I had the cubano sandwich. The pork too dry and flavorless. Also, the carpeting and booths seemed to be the same as when this location was Rosalee's Italian restaurant over 10 years ago. I will never eat here again."
2,Went there last friday evening before the fireworks at the Old Port. Place was busy... busy with loud (and drunk) men... The beers were good though not exceptionnal (tried the stout and the blonde). The food was good but you have to like smokey. We had the pork sandwich and the ribs. Plates were very small for the price and we left still hungry!
0,"I've learned to be especially wary of one star reviews, as they tend to reflect some sort of vindictiveness not generally based on the actual merits of a restaurant.  This, however, is a one star review based only on Bento's surprising ability to disappoint even the most meager of expectations.\n\nMy girlfriend and I went to Bento on a whim because it's very convenient to our place, and is cheap.  We figured that given the general rarity of bad Asian meals, and our low expectations based on Bento's prices, it'd easily be a worthwhile meal.\n\nWe were wrong.  \n\nI was not expecting great sushi at Bento's $8.75 sushi buffet.  After all, sushi quality fish is expensive, and all you can eat is generally even more expensive (in my experience, nearly $20 at a different lunch buffet.)  Even with the expectation that fish was going to be scarce and rice plentiful, I found that Bento outdid themselves.  \n\nI actually got some comedic value out of how artfully they slathered their rolls in dark sauces to obscure the fact that some of the rolls had no fish at all in them!  In fact, it was the \""Bento Special\"" roll that I dissected, only to find there to be literally nothing but rice in its depths.  As an appreciator of comedy (and occasionally of art,) I have to tip my hat to Bento's \""chef\"" for his masterful sushi tromp l'oeil!  \n\nThe other rolls were mostly just deep fried chicken wrapped around rice with a very, very small amount of what was presumably fish (pink solids.)  Their rendition of the venerable \""Philly Roll\"" contained jalapenos, cream cheese, and nothing else.  Hmmmm.\n\nMy girlfriend was smarter, though not by a wide margin, and went with one of the \""Special\"" Bento boxes.  Her General Tso's Tofu was edible, though certainly not moreso than a frozen Asian meal from the supermarket.\n\nThe last notable part of our meal was the bizarrely terrible ginger sauce, which we both tried.  Having never had anything but tasty ginger dressings at sushi restaurants, we were both unpleasantly surprised by just how bad this was.\n\nSummary: If you know that you are getting yourself into some seriously low quality sushi and bento box fare, this might be just the spot for you.  If you, like me, would much rather have 6 fresh and tasty sushi rolls for a similar price, don't be suckered in by the \""all you can eat\"" sign."
1,"Price is reasonable, service is good, food average. I eat at alot of Thai restaurants but this Pud Thai is drenched in a soup like very sweet sauce that doesn't resemble the flavor or texture of authentic Pud Thai. Otherwise everything else is average."
3,Popular place on a Saturday night!  We were able to get a seat at the bar and that worked out perfect!  The bartenders were very friendly and the food was really good.  The turkey burger was great...no complaints and the fries were tasty too!
1,"Compared to other spring training facilities and minor league ballparks, color me unimpressed. \n\nWhat is does have: \n- The outfield grass is the place to be. We roamed around to find the best spots and this seemed the most relaxing. Not too hot, and not too cold.\n- We liked the fact that the ushers didn't really care where you sit. If you wanted to sit behind home plate, nobody will stop you.\n- ample seating. Wasn't crowded when we went.\n- It's still spring training, which you can't bitch about.\n- easy parking.\n\nWhat it lacks:\n- Atmosphere! This place is quieter than a library! You could seriously hear a pin drop. Was it apathetic Angels fans? I don't know. But they only played music when there was a pitching change and even then it seemed like an afterthought. It was very surreal to go to a quiet game where nobody seemed to be really interested. I know it's spring training, but come on?\n- A decent view. You can see the freeway and a University of Phoenix building in right field. Whoop de doo! The left field had a cool view of a mesa however. \n- Decent food. It has ballpark fare and nothing else. It has nothing to write home about. The italian ice in the outfield was a welcome treat."
0,"I took my friend there for Sunday brunch today, and it was one of the worst brunches I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  Very limited selection of foods and what was on the buffet was cold and unappetizing.  Very sad excuse for a buffet brunch.  The corn muffins were dry and crunchy.  The fresh fruit on the buffet consisted of sections of red grapefruit and oranges.  There were no fresh veggies, no multigrain anything, no pasta salads, nothing at all interesting or healthy.  And the decaf coffee was horrible -- burnt tasting.  The only redeeming things were the made-to-order omelet station and the alcoholic drink that was included in the $14.99 price.   I felt badly that this is where I celebrated my friend's birthday."
3,"Give me 4 slices of thick -sliced bacon, actually cook my eggs over medium like I ask and have butter coverage all over my toast, you get 4 stars! Really Simple... \n\n\nNah seriously, this is a good breakfast, solid contender. You can get Hash-browns or Home Fries. The Home Fries are always my first choice anywhere and here they get topped with this onion-pepper mixture after -cooking which I am not a big fan of though. So, I ask them to leave it off and then request the potatoes be cooked crisply- about half the time does it come out right, but that is OK, when it actually gets done it makes it a 5 star awesome breakfast! \n\nTook my brother and his family to breakfast and they really liked it. My brother got a 'Joe Bear Scramble' which he liked and was plated so appealingly, the lady at the table next to us saw his and ordered this for herself. SIL got the HUGE Chicken Fried Steak and really liked it, she is finicky so this is good. 7YO Nephew got the Cinnamon Roll French Toast (4 pcs) which he liked. But, we had to order him a side of bacon because it does not come with any meat. Hard to justify $10 plus breakfast for a 7year old but oh well, I stole a bacon leaving him 3 pieces which he gobbled up! Suggestion, half the order and add bacon as another option, the pieces are large enough to make this a solid plate for women or kids. \n\nThe interior is on old Denny's and needs to be refreshed soon and parking can get tricky after 9:30am on a Sunday. \n\nSo, if you are in town for NASCAR or Spring Training at Goodyear Ballpark, this location is right off I-10 (Southwest side). Go here or to Mimi's (Northwest side)) for breakfast, but please, stay in Goodyear and keep businesses thriving so I have a job. Thanks :) \n\nTo get 5 stars I would say ramp up the home fries a bit, they are missing something but I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe use fresh onion without the bell-peppers (their \""mix\"" seems to be pre-made frozen prepped kind) and cook with the potatoes to caramelize versus heaping them on after in a wet mess? Dunno, but probably. \n\nEnjoy!"
0,"First and only time I'll ever go to this location. The guy at the window was straight up tweaking! I'm talking legit meth head, paranoid schizo status, scratching left and right and extremely jittery. I'm surprised he even managed to get my drinks out the window into my hand without spilling them! Yikes... \n\n\nSay no to meth and Burger King for that matter, kids."
0,"I'm not really one to write many reviews but having been so maltreated by this store and given my ire is still so up,i feel compelled to do so and hopefully warn others who are thinking of purchasing from this store.\nI should have trusted my instincts that a store that hardly labels their merchandise with price tags and continually has signs for discounts on certain items but leaving it vague and murky as to what items might be discounted and having prior history with them knowing you can haggle-i find that super sketchy.\n Still I purchased a dining room table and chairs&bench and spent over 2000 in their store in the fall because i fell in love with their tsunami table.\nOver the week-end I picked up two footstools and discovered one was cracked at the leg.The very next day I went back to the store with my receipt and explained that one stool was damaged and I wanted a refund..I met with an incredibly rude and hostile employee who basically drilled me about why I would not want a replacement stool from another store and threw my receipt at me!she told me I could not have a refund and told me that I would only be refunded on Monday.Wow.\nI guess i'll find out if she is truly the manager of the store as she said she was and i'm still unsure if I will be reimbursed and they kept the merchandise-crazy thing too is that my saleslady from the night before was there when I returend the next day and didn't say one word.\nReally really bad customer service-the worst."
0,"This was my first experience at a local farmers market and I was disappointed to find out very little of it was from AZ.  Isn't that the purpose of a farmer's market?  If you aren't a farmer why are you there selling goods from Asia and South America?  There were 2 booth that specifically advertised locally grown.  I bought some decent items from them.  One of them was selling a bunch of eggs but the cartons were from Hickman's (enormous commercial egg producer) which isn't what I envision at a small market.  Maybe they just bought the cartons from them, who knows.  \n\nThere was a person selling salsa (locally made) but it was more expensive than Whole Foods where it is also sold.  I have only been once and plan on trying other markets before going back."
3,"yummy, yummy chinese food.  thank heavens for there being one in brookline.  great food.  friendly, fast service.  decent prices.  funny kid who jumps out and tries to scare me every time i go is great in store entertainment.  very simple decore.\n\ni always walk here when i order since it so close and they always have it ready before i get there.  usually get the general tso's.  must try the other menu items someday."
1,"I have used irrigation with SPR for over 30 years. They have really dedicated people who go out of their way to be helpful. The Zanjeros were always available and  ready to work out some water issue, and they  are varied and frequent (like a neighbors dead animal in a canal) . So for many years I have been a big fan of SRP.\n\nUntil today!\n\nI needed to pay my water assessment so I went to the main office.\n1. Now a security guard tells you you are in the wrong place, no more receptionist.\n2. The payment  center was closed and turned into  a closet with some machines in it.\n3. Customer service is now a telephone on a brown wall with a sign over the phone saying call for customer service.\n\nZanjeros are now computer baby sitters for the nee Water Master system. Getting a consistent flow is a real challenge now. They are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minutes you have to move to a new user and it really does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day. The person responsible  for the Water master needs to be required to meet users at 2am when the order gets shorted by the system.\n\nWhen I called today I spoke to an old style SRP person but you might as well visit the prison as use this facility, So no matter what the literature says SRP is now just another big faceless utility doing their level best to isolate the customer."
4,Love this place! We drive 50 miles from Anthem just for the beer and food. Great selecton of craft beers and the nacaroni with brisket is to die for!
4,"Lots of IMAX theaters here, Great popcorn, all the most current movies are always playing and it's removed from the strip (but only slightly) so there's not an issue with crowds."
2,Ok so all the negative reviews made me nervous. Frank was actually better than Blue Man and Criss Angel!  I agree that you need to be at least 30 years old to enjoy it and also enjoy stand up comedy. Wish the tickets were cheaper. It was a good show. The band was great!
0,"Disappointing! As a vegetarian, I had high hopes for Fern, but the food was flavorless and executed poorly. The atmosphere is cozy, small and quaint with soft, mason jar chandelier lighting. The service was good. But I can't get over how bad the food was. \n\nThe CAULIFLOWER POUTINE was a good idea, but the potato mixed with the cauliflower had been whipped to the point of having a glue-y texture. The kind of texture that makes your tongue stick to the top of your mouth while you're trying to chew. The cheese curd tasted like mozzarella, which was fine, but nothing special. The tomato gravy was fine, and the little pile of greens on top were the only interesting flavor in the dish (very strong and herb-y). We were planning to order a few more appetizers, but after the Poutine showing, we ditched that idea. \n\nThe OM BURGER was inedible. The bun was dry and hard, and the burger patty was dense and hard and flavorless. The condiments couldn't save this burger. \n\nThe 200 YEAR OLD SOURDOUGH FLATBREAD title created a hype that the thick, hard, stale, non-sour flatbread did not live up to. I took 3 bites, which was 2 too many. On the plus side, the topping - chorizo, verde sauce, red onions and cotija cheese - was flavorful and delicious. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in scraping and only eating the top of my pizza. \n\nThe sides were also a disappointment. The QUINOA of the day was described as red quinoa, mango, mint, red onion, and some other delicious sounding ingredients. It was fresh and cold, but not at all delicious. After coating with salt, a few bites were edible, but really still no flavor at all. \n\nThe SMASHED CRISPY FINGERLING POTATOES had potential, but only 3 of 12 potatoes were actually smashed and crispy. The other 9 were whole boring fingerling potatoes with no flavor or crunch. After mixing the flatbread topping with some of the potatoes, I was able to eat a few bites. \n\nThe waitress seemed surprised that we didn't want to take to-go the 75% of our dishes that we didn't eat. No, thanks. We're heading to Taco Bell for a little flavor."
0,Really wanted to like this place.  But had a horrendous experience all around... Staff was woefully inept and over their heads.  Food came out 40 minutes later and was burnt & inedible.  We will not be back.  Very sad to see yet another restaurant fail so early...  good luck to them.
1,"It's the bare minimum that you would expect from Starbucks. I have never been able ti order a breakfast sandwich because they always run out before 10am. When asked how many sandwiches they usually carry the lady told me only 7! No wonder they always run out. They are only good for making you a drink at a mediocre pace. And don't expect much from these baristas, They have a sense of entitlement to the place that subtly overwhelms the customer service. Handle the stress ladies, its just a coffee shop."
2,"I like 99 cent stores because you'll find the most random junk at these places.  At this location, there's mostly food - fresh produce and groceries all around!  I'm a bit skeptical on buying the food here, but what I'm really looking for is cheap useless crap for whatever reasons!\n\nOn my last visit, I found glow in the dark stuff - perfect for birthday parties in dark clubs and ring pops to remind us of the 80s!  \n\nIt's pretty clean and organized inside, for the most part.  It's not like those 99 cent store back in the days when they first came out.  These chain ones really know how to take care of themselves!\n\nSidenote: I did end up buying avocados from here - 4 for a dollar!  They were of the small variety and I must admit, they were surprisingly good and actually just right.  The last one was a bit bruised, so it wasn't in the most perfect of conditions, but overall, not bad for a buck!"
1,"This place has been the talk of the town since it opened! Finally arrive to check it out with my son for lunch. I had the baby back ribs. They are served on a plastic tray from coco-cola on paper. I picked the first one up and bit into what I think is beef jerky. The amoke flavor is way to strong for me. The other pieces were like eating rubber. When you bit into it, it was like the snap you get from a braut then chew chew chew. \nMy son had the pulled pork. He enjoyed it and said the meat was tender and moist. \nI may give it one more try with the wife since she has been wanting to come here."
0,"Please be aware of the time share sell!! Like those postings not recommended, the guy on the street promised the free stay was to be in the Cosmo, but that was not true. He promised there would be only three questions and a visit to their rooms, casino, and a brief preso.  Definitely not true ... The preso lasted an hour, they don't have a casino if their own, and the model room was a pit!! The carpeting from the elevator to the room was stained and worn.  The pool was small and crammed between two large resorts. Last of all the free gifts were misrepresented."
2,"I would definitely recommend the rib eye and the bar tenders really know to pour solid cocktails. Price wise the menu is fairly steep, service was great though."
0,"I bought a new BMW f650gs twin two weeks ago (May 2012).  It was missing it's owner's manual so the sales person said he would order it \""overnight\"".  I came in two days later to pick it up from the parts department and after 10 minutes of waiting, could not get the parts guy to help me.  Later that day I received a phone call that the manual hadn't even come in and that it would be in on Thursday.  I show up Friday and there are 3 guys at the parts and service counter.  I asked one of them if I could pick up my owners manual, and he said only the parts guy could help me.  The parts guy knew I was waiting but insisted on talking about his days riding Ducati motorcycles on flattracks to somebody ... on and on and on.  Finally I walked out, not happy.  I called my sales guy and asked him to send me the manual.  IIt finally arrived after two weeks ... maybe I took \""invisibility\"" pills or something, because I had the exact same experience a year ago when I came in to check on some parts prices for my friend in Texas (no dealer at the time in his city).\n\nUpdate as of August, 2012.  After sending letters to the VP at BMW NA, I was finally about to resolve an outstanding issue - my BMW \""Ride Smart\"" reward.  It took almost 2.5 months of nagging BMW corporate to rectify a few simple issues with my very expensive motorcycle purchase.  I have read so many great things about this dealer on the internet (e.g. BMW forums) but did not receive even a basic level of customer service and attention to two issues:  a missing manual (finally got it) and a missing reward for purchasing a new BMW (finally got it).  Because of this treatment, I will never buy another BMW product.  \n\nAugust 2012 update:  I made a video showing the good, bad and ugly of this motorcycle.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6koHzbDCCNk&list=UUSZgIbvZItJr78kHY3Y9wnA&index=5&feature=plcp\n\nUpdate 01/2013.  I have had multiple issues with my brand new BMW and finally have given up on Victory for any form of proper resolution.  BMW NA doesn't care.  I am so frustrated with this bike, I continue to make the payments, but have permanently parked it at my house in Jerome until I can have the time to work on it myself and correct all of the defects (hard starting, mid range sputter, tires losing pressure, heated grips not working).  BMW is the worst product I have ever purchased.  I did just buy a new Suzuki Bandit - now that's a quality product with no defects!  Every time I drive by Victory I have bad memories of paying more than full retail and getting no service or followup - I feel they cheated me and I can only hope Karma will ultimately knock on their door.\n\nUpdate 06/2013 - I have been using Go AZ for BMW issues I cannot resolve - they are an awesome dealer.  I will never step foot in the Victory dealership again."
0,"SLOW getting food out, server had too many tables to do anything other than take our order.  Sat for over 45 minutes after placing our order without food or drink refills.  Many tables after us got their food way before us and all we ordered was sliders, chicken strips and fries.  Server kept saying \""just a few more minutes\"" and food didn't come out in a few more minutes.  Lots of frustrated patrons waiting and waiting and waiting.  When our food finally came out, the burgers were not cooked as we ordered, the chicken strips were sitting in grease and the fried things tasted like they'd been fried in old grease.  We were in a hurry to get back to our conference so we didnt hwve time to complain. Greasy and not worth the wait or price!"
4,Yummo... But I wouldn't recommend the Hooters Roll...
1,"After reading so many positive reviews, I expected much more from this place.  While the dish presentations were attractive and the flatbread was pretty good, the rest of our experience was unimpressive.  There are many other restaurants I would visit before considering a return to Eno Vino."
0,I gave one star because the food was good.... Service terrible. My husband and I went out for our last date night for a while before welcoming our son into the world. We were seated quickly and a server introduced himself because our server was busy with a big party needless to say we had FOUR different servers which is ok but our appetizers bread and entrees came out within 5 minutes of eachother. Frustrating to say the least then the server came by and asked if we would like our filets put under the heat lamp while we finished our appetizers both of us enjoy our steaks medium rare/medium so a heat lamp is deff not a solution. \n\nI'm not one to complain but if I am going somewhere spending over $30 a plate I'd enjoy not being rushed through our entire meal. Will not be returning anytime soon.
3,"Been a member of Gold's Gym first, then 24 Hour Fitness and now LVAC. As far as equipment is concerned, this is the best gym I have ever been a member of. They have top of the line stuff and it is always in good working order. If it breaks, they are on it and get it repaired quickly! A lot more than I can say about Gold's and 24 Hour Fitness.\n\nBut, I have to say they are lacking in customer service. Every employee at 24 Hour Fitness on Green Valley Parkway felt like a personal friend. They greeted you, remembered you, and said goodbye to you when you left. I actually miss them. I kinda felt like an idiot when I moved back to Summerlin two years ago and joined LVAC because it was closer to my new house, and I would try and spark a conversation with the counter workers and they would look at me like I was an idiot and didn't care to speak to me. And when I left after my workout, they would never say goodbye. I waived to them, thinking I was at my old 24 Hour Fitness on Green Valley Parkway, and they never waived back for my first two weeks being a member. I finally realized they didn't care if I were coming or going, so I just stopped trying to speak with them when I checked in and stopped waiving goodbye when I left.\n\nEnding to this story is that I love the location, love the equipment, love the set up but I am not a fan of the hospitality. Do I recommend this gym? Oh of course! If you're looking for a good work out and not great hospitality, this is the place for you. I have to admit that I come in on a mission, headphones on and tunnel vision only focusing on my workout. I've always been that way, but 24 Hour Fitness on Green Valley Parkway changed me and made me more open and friendly to the staff. But it took me a week or so to realize that LVAC is not here to be your friends, they are here to get you in shape. And I honestly don't have a beef with that all. I am in the best shape I've been in since having a gym membership, so they are doing something right! :)"
1,"This hotel was a very disappointing experience. I like to travel with my dogs and Vdara advertises being dog friendly. I called them before I made any reservation to get detailed information on their pet policy. \n\nThey told me that they provide dishes and crates for the dogs so I wouldn't have to bring my own. \n\nI drove there so I could have easily brought my puppy's cage and dishes for my dogs. However, since I was told I wouldn't need either I didn't bring any of them with me. \n\nAfter I checked in, exhausted from my long drive 2 tiny crates arrived at my room. The hotel says up to 2 dogs combined weight per room 70lbs. The crates they brought were too tiny for my 43lb Springer and my 30lb puppy could be crammed in but couldn't lay down or sit comfortably. \n\nThey delivered blankets, a bisquit and a room service menu but no baggies as promised and no bowls. So I called downstairs 4 times to get no answer and went down to speak to them finally. I was told they only had paper dishes and no larger crates. \n\nObviously the paper dishes are not so reuse able with water and difficult to clean from food too so I had to ask for a new set the following day and didn't even get real dog dishes, no attempt was even made to give a a real bowl from room service. \n\nThen my second night the puppy got stuck in the tiny crate and suddenly 2 different size larger crates appeared at my door after being told many times that they had nothing larger. \n\nMy dogs were dying of thirst the entire stay and everytime I needed to feed them was a project. This was not relaxing!  It was frustrating and some of the hotel staff were apologetic but most couldn't be bothered helping me with the dogs needs. \n\nIf you can't make proper accommodations you should not call yourself pet friendly!  I was charged a fee for having the pets but not given the necessary accommodations for them as promised. \n\nVery frustrating. \n\nI also got no bell service at check out and the valets were not helpful with my bags loading up my car when I had 2 dogs in my hand too. \n\nThe beds were not comfy either and all around Vdara was a HUGE disappointment."
3,"This place kind of just fell into my lap while walking around our office building. This place has REALLY good food if you are into heavy, flavorful meals. My favorite to get here is the Jambalaya. SO GOOD. This location is a very small location, but worth standing in line for if you wanted to try it. It's constantly packed, so make sure you are okay with waiting for a spot."
0,"After also waiting for this place to open I came for lunch, mind you there were only about 3 tables seated during the time. It was all hype! \nThe food was mediocre: the meatballs were lukewarm, the baguettes were overly toasted that I couldn't bite down on them. The salads were decent but needed some salt. \nThe service itself was painfully slow. The food took 20-30 min to come out and we had a very simple order. When it came time to pay the servers didnt seem to be properly trained with the register system. It took, literally, 20 min to pay!! One of the managers decided to treat us to gelato while we waited for it to be situated. Once the checks came out they weren't even processed correctly. They should have just comped the entire meal, a measly $10 per person, instead of us waiting soooo long and not getting it right the first time. We ended up back at work late. Will most likely not be coming back...first impressions are everything."
3,The chicken was really delicious. The palabok and Kare-kare was excellent. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again.
1,"Lunch special only  till 4 pm . $7.99. Okay food nothing special that would make me want to come back. Service was just OK. Overall, I have had way better thai food else where ."
4,"The egg pizza is the bomb!!  Also, awesome garlic fries and a great chopped salad.  Everyone we recommended the egg pizza to loved it!!"
1,"Mr Mama's signage made it look like a tile store from the outside.  The restaurant was crowded and seemed to be doing well.  The service was good and friendly.\n\nI did not like the food here.  I got the chicken fried steak, I did not like the gravy, the fried steak was ok, but not great.   The home fries were soggy and bland.  The eggs were cooked correctly which was fine.   I also got clam chowder which was over seasoned.  My meal was not worth finishing.\n\nOverall the food all seemed to be prepared correctly, but the recipes that were used were just bad.  I will likely not come here again."
3,"If you haven't tried this place you must try it soon!  I was always an avid Starbucks customer but once I've tried coffee bean & tea leaf it was Starbucks no more.  yes I know it's another commercial coffee place but I swear Starbucks coffee quality has gone down for the past several years.\n\nI travel to and from the Bay Area every week for work and it saddens me that they have no Coffee Bean in the Bay Area, so when I'm in Vegas you will always find me here for my daily coffee drink.  The best part is they also have them all over the mccarran airport so I can always get my Coffee Bean fix before my flight."
1,"The Stone Crab and Joe's is fantastic if you catch it on the right day.  Sunday afternoon I sat at the bar and enjoyed great service and a terrific meal.  That 1st visit was a recon mission for a future date with the wife.  My honey & I went on a Thursday night.  The crab was horribly spoiled, the texture was odd and it tasted like ammonia.  The waiter was a clod hopping oaf.  I should have flipped my plate on the floor, spit in the face of the idiot and walked out without paying!  Caesars can be like this, hit-or-miss... Caveat emptor!"
1,$5.00 for an iced tea?!  Okay - don't get me wrong - I really love tea but what started out as a simple tasting turned into a high pressure sales tactic that left me kicking myself.  I guess I should give the sales clerk for knowing how to make a sale. But when I asked her if my iced tea was caffeinated becasue I could really use some caffeine to kick start my shopping adventures.  She repleid no but you will like it anyway. Hmm - not sure that's what I was thinking 10 minutes later.
2,The sushi rolls are kinda thin. I heard a lot of good things about this place. I only found it to be ok. I was not that impressed. I'd go again but it wouldn't be my first choice.
0,"The service sucked. Managers were outside on break or smoking when the restaurant was packed. Always out of something on the menu, like taquitos. I like el pollo loco food and will have to drive further to get better food and service then this location!"
0,This now a Waitrose
1,"Short and to the point... this place was kinda grungy but NOT in that good Seattle way, the food tasted ok but my ribs were cold in the middle, good pricing IF you get what you pay for (that might be a big IF), and the lady behind the bar was nice. I'm probably gonna go back to try the wings because I hear good things about them... we\""ll see..."
1,We waited in a line and paid $28 for our dinner - plus an $11 all-you-can-drink option! \n\nOn a positive note the drink option is awesome and they have a literal plethora of food. They also had hot steamed crab legs which was a huge plus. Unfortunately there wasn't anything I thought was delicious. They really had a problem keeping hot food hot and cold food cold. I would not recommend this to anyone with taste buds.
2,"I stood in a long, hot line at Curdfest to try the Curd Girl curds for a second time. I had high hopes after my initial so-so experience, however, I was again let down.  The curds were hot and gooey, but the taste was just bland.  The strawberry rhubarb sauce was good, but the two favors didn't complement each other as much as I'd hoped. The girls that run it are so sweet, and I really wish I liked the curds more. But, I've been underwhelmed twice now.  I'm sticking with my three star rating."
1,"I'd heard some positive buzz, but was rather unimpressed. We hit Hanny's on a Friday night and it struck me as one of those places that try to do too much and end up not doing much very well. My salad was okay but nothing I'd make a special trip for, my friend who ordered the Shrimp Pancetta appetizer said it was yummy, but the third in our party had the Pork Calabrese sandwich and it was so greasy I my skin almost broke out just sitting next to it. The too-loud (and \""too cool\"") DJ and overpriced drinks didn't help the situation. It is a cool space and perhaps I just wanted too much, but I was simply disappointed.\n\nI would give it another try, but only if other people were going and it was an \""I'll meet up with you there\"" kind of thing. It definitely wouldn't be my pick. I hear the pizzas are a tasty option and I would give them a try if I find myself back there. Maybe they will win me over then."
3,This is a outdoor shopping area.  Great shops.  Beautiful spot to stop for brunch and then go shopping!!!  Great addition to Vegas to get away from the Strip!
3,"Hidden in the corner of a strip mall, coming across Miles Bake Shop and Hawaiian Food is purely an accident - but a good one.  However, there are plenty of people in the know who know exactly where to find this place and they keep coming back for more.  \n\nAs you approach the glass doors, you can't help but notice all the various handwritten posters advertising what's for sale.  And what is for sale then?  Hawaiian food - plate lunches, desserts, poke, etc.\n\nWe walked in hesitantly, not sure what to expect.  Four guys were hanging out around a table and one of them got up and greeted us.  He headed to the counter and offered us a \""long john\"" because, as he said, we looked hungry and it looked like we couldn't make a proper decision on what to order if we were hungry.  I sheepishly accepted this \""long john\"" and bit into a lovely pastry filled with sweet egg custard cream.  Yum.  The Husband sunk his teeth into his own \""long john\"" and we looked over the lunch menu posted on the dry erase board.\n\n* Chicken Katsu Plate Lunch ($8.25) - It came with two scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad.  The Husband said it was good - crispy, lots of texture, and mostly made up of dark  meat.  It definitely had a nice crunch to it.\n\n* Chili Plate Lunch ($8.25) - Mine also came with two scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad.  I'm not sure what makes this \""Hawaii-style\"" chili, as it was described. But it was tasty, although a bit too salty. \n\nAll orders are technically to go, but if you're nice, they may let you enjoy your meal at the one of two tables inside.  Dennis, the owner, sat down to chat with us and he is super friendly.  Another regular also chatted with us too while we enjoyed our lunch.  We saw quite a few regulars show up - for poke, malasadas, etc.  We even got to sample some of the poke too, which we appreciated.\n\nRight now, it's just this one location - but there are plans for a couple more.  They've been at this location for a little over a year, although they've been in business at other places for many years prior.\n\nOverall, Miles Bake Shop and Hawaiian Food has a lot on their plate.  Serving up plate lunches, sweet desserts, and tasty poke makes them pretty popular.  Their daily specials change and they do run out, so call ahead if you have your favorites.  (They were out of the lau lau yesterday, and I'm curious about  their pastele.)  But you really can't beat the aloha spirit and friendliness that is spilling out of this place!\n\n3.5 stars"
1,Service was good food was kind of crappy. It's kind of like IHOP with bigger portions.
3,"(New patient)Got here at 545, waited til 6 when they opened. Got put into a room right away, waited 20ish mins to see the vet. Told her the issue, she took her back for a full exam. Exam costs $42 (she's a chihuahua so it might vary by size). Clipped her nails (I'm a horrible parent, they were very long, $10).\nShe ended up needing a ton more done (xrays, blood tests, went home w/2 meds) bill was $700 and no diagnosis.. no broken paw or anything abnormal in tests, she's just in horrible pain and can barely use her left front paw/leg.Sent home with pain meds and anti inflammatory. Back a month later for same thing. Super nice doctors, staff can seem a bit in a hurry/rushed/not concerned. but all in all good =] we're back a few times a month for nail clipping"
4,"Incredibly good bread, pastries, and coffee.  The croissants and baguettes are just like what you can buy in France."
1,"I had one appointment with Dr. Harter while I was baby doctor shopping after moving here from Boston. Moving from Boston, where ALL my my doctors, in every single discipline, had an ivy league education and were board certified to Las Vegas, where, well, that is sooo far from the case, proved to be a little challenging to find quality care. \nDr. Harter seems to have found his niche as Vegas' \""natural doctor\"" because he's the only one in the valley that does VBACs and water births. It's nice that he is supportive of this, but I got the impression that he is just in this field because it's probably pretty lucrative being the only one. I'm really passionate about natural birth and I asked him a ton of questions, like will baby and mom be left undisturbed for an hour after birth; what is the backup plan should Dr. Harter be attending another birth; how supportive is the hospital of breastfeeding; and the answers were just not really satisfactory by my standards. \nDr. Harter's procedures were also not only not consistent with natural-minded patients, but not really good practice for ANY OB. At the first appointment, he gave me a sheet of \""okay medications.\"" When you're pregnant, there's no such thing as universally \""okay medications!\"" And, there were medications on the sheet that have recently been linked to a three times increase in miscarriage (according to an article on CNN). So not okay! Not to mention, handing a sheet that says \""if you have a headache, take this\""; \""if you have a stomach ache, take this\""; means that he does not take the time to personally consult over what could be serious symptoms. My OB in Boston (who has her medical degree from Yale) advised me not to take ANY medications without checking with her first. \nDr. Harter also wheeled in an ultrasound machine, even though there was no indication whatsoever to do an ultrasound. The AAP, and the ACOG recommend against non-medically indicated ultrasounds, as there have been some studies pointing to possible harm of too many ultrasounds. Just the doppler is fine! But, a doctor can bill more to insurance for doing an ultrasound! \nAside from my experience with the doctor himself, the office staff was terrible! It took me over a month to get an appointment! They refused to book an appointment until I sent over my records from Boston, which I sent promptly, and they then LOST. Yes, they lost my medical records. So, I sent them again, and they never called me; I called them 2.5 weeks later. \nThe office really felt like a cattle call as well. There were sooo many people in the waiting room, and we waited for 2.5 hours!! Dr. Harter was attending a birth and didn't reschedule me or any of his other patients during this time (but hey, why lose the billable visits?). And, as much as I was not at all happy about the crazy unreasonable wait, I would really hate to be that poor woman giving birth with a doctor attending that knew in the back of his head that he had to get back as quickly as possible to see a rapidly growing list of waiting patients that he didn't reschedule. \nBut as awful as this sounds given all of the negatives above, if I HAD to have a doctor in Las Vegas, I would likely go with him, given the extremely slim pickings here and his at least openness to a natural approach (and he's board certified - again hard to find around here). But luckily, I found a fantastic midwife that I'm really really comfortable with."
4,"I am SO glad we picked Tyler to be our wedding photographer. He takes AWESOME pictures and is fun to be around. We knew when he met him that we would enjoy being around him and that we could trust him to document the most important day of our lives! We have a variety of great photos to show for it. From the funny to the dramatic, our pictures turned out great.\n\nI hesitate to call Tyler a \""great value\"" because that might suggest that you aren't getting super high-quality photography with him. But you are.\n\nTyler is an expert photographer, works great under pressure, and is a personable guy. You're not going to go wrong with him!\n\nI can't wait until we have an excuse to use Tyler for something else!"
3,"Vitos \n\nShitty lil strip mall...good pizza. \n\nI had been driving around for a new place to check out, since it feels like forever since I reviewed anywhere. I miss ma Yelp. \n\nplace #1 closed for the day \nplace #2 appeared to be closed down \n\nDesperate and hungry i found Vitos via Yelp and was ahh what ev... \n\nI ordered the thick crust and listened to other yelpers talk shit about coworkers, chatted with a guy from Surprise and waited. \n\nThe pizza was good, sauce was a bit salty but I liked it. The crust was thick chewy on the inside and crispy on the bottom. It was good. \n\nAfter 2 slices and one more bit of the corner of one more slice, I packed the rest to go. The neighbor kid was walking by as I drove up so he was in for a good snack as I gave him the left overs. \n\nWould I go back? Maybe if I were in the area or suggesting it to someone but it is not better then Barros to me. Sorry."
1,Tasted worst than a college dorm cafeteria. UC Davis has a better eating experience than this buffet. Limited selection and undercooked meat.
2,"Dined at Kokomo's with the $29.99 per person prix fixe deal currently offered at certain Mirage restaurants. My dad had the crab cake, surf and turf, and chocolate cake, while I had the carrot salad, salmon, and butterscotch custard. The crab cake and carrot salad were just okay. The surf and turf dish was wonderful - the steak was like butter, and the shrimp was tasty. The salmon was a very hefty portion, not too fishy, in a nice light sauce, but the accompanying side of rice was terribly bland. Desserts were good but not great. For the price, this is a great deal, but I'd probably recommend trying the other higher-rated Mirage restaurants instead. On our night at Mirage, Onda and Fin were closed, Japonais was no longer serving their lounge meal for 2 (5-8PM only), and we didn't want Stack since we've eaten at sister restaurant Fix already...so we were stuck with Kokomo's. Good value for the deal, but not some of the finest Vegas has to offer."
0,"Below Average\nMenu:\nHotpot              1/5\nService:           5/5\nManagement   2/5\n\nI had tried all three different kind of hotpot here.  The plain one, the special and the spicy one.  The plain one was average.   Anyone who knows how to put water and buy all the ingredients at a Chinese supermarket can make the plain one at home.  The special was awful.  The pepper was floating on top of the soup and the flavor didn't simmer in as it suppose to.  The chef pretty much just put in the raw Chinese herb material in and serve.  The correct way should be cooked in the back with  with a stock for several hours as a soup base.  Not the case here.  Same goes for the Mala flavor (the spicy pot)  You have take extra effort to ask for the condiments such as satay sauce, garlic, chili sauce.  They even charge you for the egg to put in your condiment sauce.  How do people eat a plain taste of the hotpot without the condiment sauces?\n\nThe services was slow because they seem to be under staff.  The waiting line was ridiculously long.  There are simply not enough staffs. \nHowever, we need to give their staffs a lot of credits for putting in the effort of putting up with some awful customers.  An reasonable man screamed at the staff because he refused to give the staff his room number nor proper name to put it to his room charge.  At the end, the customers starts screaming at the staff and no management was brave enough to tell the customers that he was at fault.  I believe the cashiers had put up her best effort to do her job.  However, the failure to see her managers to back her up nor stop the clients from disturbing other customers was a total failure on the management."
4,"First off, I have a fear of heights, but the High Roller was A-ok!  Went during the day time when prices were cheaper.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Was able to see as far as the mountains.  Takes about 30 minutes to get a full rotation.  You barely notice that it's moving, very gradual.  Make sure to use the bathroom and don't drink too much before you go on.  Night time I imagine would be just as nice, only you wouldn't be able to see far off, but the Vegas skyline would make up for that.\n\nThe units can hold up to 40 people, but I seriously don't see it having to be that cramped.  Unless your group is just that big.  They are spacious and air conditioned.  It's worth doing at least once.  Not for the thrill, but for the view."
1,"I was debating whether to give this a 2 or 3, but after reading other reviews, going with the 2 rating as it doesn't seem like they get customer service.\n\nIt started out poorly.  My brother had made a tee time and when he booked it, told the person he had a coupon from the local paper (it was Memorial Day and they were running a special for that day), which they said they'd note on the reservation.  When he checked in (before me), he told the person behind the counter that he had the coupon, and they honored the price.  I checked in about 15 minutes later, and someone new as behind the counter.  I didn't know about the coupon, so I paid for myself and my guest.  My brother came in just after the guy ran the transaction and mentioned the coupon.  At this point, the employee became very difficult.  He told us that he couldn't honor the coupon since I didn't mention it, and it was too late.  He berated us for even suggesting that we ask for a discount after the fact.  My brother told him about telling the person on the phone about it, and how it shouldn't be hard to reverse the transaction especially since the deal was advertised for this day only.  The employee continued to be rude so I just suggested we go play and see if someone else was working when we finished.  As a side note, when we finished, there was someone else and they did give us a $40 refund (value of the coupon) but had to find the owner to do it, which took about 15 minutes.\n\nPace of play was very slow, just over 5 hours (which to me, is painful, I'm used to 4 hour rounds at home and we walk...this was 5+ hours with everyone in carts).  We complained to a ranger a few times, but they said the course was backed up (but it seemed to be just two groups playing slow ahead of us).  \n\nTees were kind of hairy and hard, not well manicured.  The greens were in good shape though, rolled pretty well, fairways weren't too bad.  Nice layout overall, some good holes.  Overall, a pretty easy course.\n\nI didn't use the range, but my brother said the balls were very old and cracked.\n\nWe played a course up in Greenville earlier in the weekend, and it was the same price with better conditions and much better attitude from the staff."
0,"i'm not sure if this is the walmart branch, but it doesn't matter.  i moved her and opened an account at walmart (which i absolutely despise), but it was close and i don't know the area.  i came here with a cashier's check from my other bank. so for 10 business days i had no money.  so i called a day earlier so i can buy some food and the girl asks the supervisor that if i have proof that the check has cleared then i could access the money. so after some calls i get the proof and when i call back they tell me i can only have a portion of the money. even though it has cleared, i can't even touch my own money.  what bullshit!!!!!!!!!!  because i was new.  who fucking cares if i am new.  if i have money that the check has cleared, then i should be able to use MY money.  total bullshit.  also, when you call each person tells you different information.  i don't think the left hand knows what the right hand is doing in this place.  i plan on finding another institute and will make them give me all cash so this shit does not happen again."
0,I thought it was the worst Mongolian Stir Fry I have ever eaten.  I love Mongolian food.   I was expecting more asian flavor.  It had more like a BBQ flavor.  I didn't care for the service.  I found the servers were trying too hard.  I thought they were extremely annoying.  I do like when they ask if need I something but not everytime I take a bite.  I would never go back mainly because of the service.  I want to be leff alone and enjoy my meal.  Don't try to upsale every single thing on the menu.  It seemed like to me the waiters and waitresses were forced to do this.  If they didn't they would be canned.  I didn't like the atmosphere either.  It was like sports grill/ asian.  Just odd.  Another stupid Corp American type restaurant.  Don't waste your money on this place!!!!
1,"This theater isn't nearly as scary as people make it out to be - it's just a relic from the early 90s when Mills malls were the rage all over the country.  Now they just look dated and have a different crowd.\n\nI was dragged here on a Thursday night to lose a few brain cells watching a mind-numbing comedy with five other people in the entire ghost town of a theater. I'll never be able to get those hours back, but even if they offered refunds for that at the box office I am sure Harkins would direct us to the self-service machine only to have it break down on us.\n\nMelinda's card wouldn't swipe when we were trying to buy tickets on one machine - so we moved to the other machine where the transaction was successful, but the tickets and receipt didn't print.  We then had to go to the box office, which is exactly what those machines were meant to prevent, to tell them our tickets didn't print.  The manager simply just let us in.  I suppose we could have made up that story entirely.  Maybe we will next time."
0,"I absolutely HATE that I can say this... but, I remember the days when Mill Avenue had a different feel to it. There used to be fewer chains and the vibe was much more bohemian, making it more or less the only part of the Valley with any personality. Several years later, visitors to Mill Avenue really just go to a simulacrum; a soulless husk of an Old West-ish main drag. Don't be fooled by the \""historical buildings\"" on the street, as a number of them are over a century old, but quite a few were built architecturally designed to look old. I can appreciate the aesthetic value of it, just as I can appreciate the attempt to make a walkable neighborhood. Unfortunately, only this synecdoche of Tempe is walkable: the majority of visitors have to drive to get here (not good for a bar-hopping/drinking-and-driving destination) and the lack of amenities would still make it difficult to live and work here without a car, unless they shop for groceries at the corner CVS. Its proximity to ASU is likely to keep it a popular destination, as is Downtown Phoenix' laziness and willingness to let Tempe take prominent events (i.e. Oktoberfest, New Year's Eve,) but all in all it's worth avoiding."
0,Just had the worst experience at this place the staff is rude there was 20 open tables 4 party sitting horrible service do not go...
0,"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. This is the second time I have left there so unhappy. The first time my Fiance and i went in and got mani's and pedi's. they were rude to both of us and acted like they hated every second of us being there. I THOUGHT it was probably just a fluke and I gave them another shot this afternoon. ... and I wish I hadn't. I only had limited time so i picked my pink color and asked for just a regular manicure. THe girl then proceded to tell me that that the pink wouldn't look good on me. I should just do a french manicure with pink tips.I said no I just want them to be all pink. She said \""It no look good, to much pink for you\"" I thought she was joking bc who the hell says that??!! ... but she wasn't. She then told me well its only going to last 2 days with this color. So i said 'Oh is it a bad brand should i pick another brand'? and she said 'no you can do gel manicure'. I again said nope JUST the REGULAR manicure, and she shook her and and said ok but it is going to chip because your nails are so OILY..... WHAT??? AGAIN who says that ... in all my years getting manicures I have never had issues with my nails being to oily for a manicure. This literally went on for like 5 min and I should have just left. The manicure she gave me was TERRIBLE and she was so sloppy with the clipping ( she wacked them off, and the edges were like razor sharp) filing( so uneven, I had to tell her to fix spots)  and the paint job was uneven and lumpy. I literally felt like crying she was just SUCH a b*%&*h and so bad at her job. In all my years I have never NOT tipped and I did not giver her a dime more than the $12 it cost me to have this done to my nails. I just couldn't tip her. It was that bad. \n\nI WILL NEVER EVER GO HERE AGAIn... there are waaaaay to many other places to give your business too in the area."
0,The reason for this one star review is because there is NO possibility of sleep at this hotel on the weekends and they simply don't care. It is 3:23AM as I write this with front desk informing me it will last till 4:00 AM. \nLike many who come here for conventions - this is deeply disturbing when one must get up early for work - and to pay high Vegas rates for a top property.
3,"Been here twice, and YUM!  The shakes are de-lish.  The turkey burger is so yummy!  So are many of the others.  If you are looking for a casual, fun, and tasty place for lunch or dinner, this is a great pic."
4,"I am always in a rush when I come here but they have awesome food and super cool items to buy!! We found this place before it was super busy and loved that this find was close to our office.\n\nFavorites: pulled pork sandwich, black & blue burger and the blue brisket salad.  Love all of these!! \n\nSorry so short gotta go back to the office!!"
2,"Hadn't been here in years.   Came back recently with a large group for a business meeting.  The food was simple, steak, chicken and a baked potato.  The salad was your salad from a bag dressed with store bought raspberry dressing.  The chicken was standard, but the steak was surprisingly well done.  I've got to say since the kitchen was churning out steaks for 150 people, that is impressive.\nThe verde bar was kept busy by all the thirsty folks and the margaritas were tasty.  They have a full liquor bar and that was emptied pretty quickly. We had a cute show emceed by a guy who looked the part of a grizzled, slightly off kilter miner.  The show really is the reason why you come here.  Its a cute place to take out of towners, as a person who lives in Phoenix, I won't be making the drive regularly out here, but the place looks like a movie set and it's still closer than driving to Old Tucson :)"
4,"I wasn't sure what to expect when walking in, I didn't check reviews first because I always give bagel places a chance. I'm from Ohio and miss the great Jewish NY-style deli's I had all around me, because there is a serious lack of them in Arizona. However, Bagel Man has the best bagels in the valley. They have great varieties and are incredibly delicious and last for longer than most you would get at Chompie's or some other fake deli. The owner was awesome, he introduced himself and was doing everything well. They serve Boar's Head meat which is the best if you ask me and they have some variety for being a small place. I recommend this place to all for a nice little lunch or bringing bagels home or to the office."
3,"Fun B.B.Q. to visit in Kitchener-Waterloo.\n\nMy partner and I visited for lunch and enjoyed their \""family\"" pit platter, with sides of fresh cut fries, beer battered onion rings, cornbread, collard greens, coleslaw, et cetera, all washed down with Ontario craft brews.  Wine list features very affordable Ontario wines.\n\nFriendly service, live music at nights, atmospheric decor.  One can't go wrong dining/drinking here."
3,"The Arthur's menu offers a wide variety of options, including burgers, sandwiches, wraps, soup, salad, & grinders...plus wine desserts & other treats.\nA great spot found in Southpark Mall, to avoid the food court and maybe select something a little healthier."
3,"I visited this Z Tejas a couple of months ago and had a fabulous time. The downstairs was about to close, but they said no problem seating us anyway. \nThe bartender actually served us and did a great job. \nWhen about to order something he had tried and hadn't liked he gave his input and explained why. Which I appreciate the honesty about a product he didn't feel was up to standard, saving me the time trying it. \nMy food was hot, and tasted great. \nOur server didn't know how I liked my sour cream so he brought out both ways. Cold and the way the chef served it. \nMy drink was never empty. Service was honest. Food was hot. They did great and I plan to return again.\nUnfortunately my second visit was less amazing, but still good."
1,"I really am not a fan. I went here for an eye appointment and to get contacts for the first time. I told them I was very, very nervous about contacts and I had previously been told I was a bad candidate because I've always been really nervous about things in my eyes (for the record, I'm pretty relaxed about everything. I could probably fall asleep at the dentist...but there is just something about my eyes). \n\nWhen it came time for my first appointment to try on my contacts, I was having trouble getting the contacts in. The woman assisting me was getting clearly frustrated with me and had me almost in tears. I told her first thing that I was really anxious about contacts and that this was really stressful for me and she was just short of yelling at me about getting them in.\n\nMy doctor was the opposite...very nice and patient with me. However, when I told them I didn't feel like my vision was being corrected adequately (both with contacts and glasses), they said I had too high of expectations for what I should be able to see. I struggled to read the last two lines of letters on the chart. I can't read a license plate that is traveling a reasonable distance in front of me. \n\nThe whole experience was pretty terrible...I can't see great with the contacts and it was borderline traumatic being yelled at over putting in contacts in the first time (only to be completely disappointed with the results). I need to be able to see far distances for my job and we haven't been able to correct enough (I switched job roles in large part due to my problems seeing far distances). \n\nEarlier today, I called to order contacts (I had given up and just been wearing my glasses. But for vanity reasons & working with VIPs lately, I wanted contacts as an option). The person I spoke to kept insisting I had never done a contact trial with them, the eye doctor had never seen contacts on my eye and I needed to be trained how to wear contacts, since I had never gone through any of that with them. I was very insistent that I had gone through all of that several times. It was a fight before they finally agreed to order my prescription. I did go through with ordering three months (only because I don't have the time to deal with it right now), but I plan to take my prescription elsewhere and find a new eye doctor.  \n\nTerrible customer service and record keeping. Also...a bad selection of glasses. Really cannot recommend."
1,"I love Coffee Bean for the unique, malted taste of the powders. I do not love this location though. \n\nAbout 3 months ago, I received a free drink for buying a $25 gift-card. I ordered the new toffee-flavored drink, and said I wanted it OVER-ice (I've learned to use that term with this chain) and with non-fat milk. The girl said something about how it's already pretty low-fat. That should've been my clue that there was a disconnect in communication, because what I was handed was one of those disgusting Ice-Blended drinks. Sweeter than a milkshake, that's why I don't like them. That's why I STRESS \""OVER-ICE\"" at Coffee Bean. I really wanted to tell her it was wrong, but the girl was really nice, I was in a hurry and not to mention, the drink was technically free. I drank MAYBE 1/6 of it and dumped the rest when I got home. It was an extra-large, too.  \n:/\n\nSo the reason I decided to post this review, is because of my boyfriend's experience this morning. He ordered an iced black & white mocha. What he got was a HOT mocha. He is shy and dislikes confrontations of any kind, so he just accepted this completely wrong drink and left. He said the girl that took his order had no personality, and when she called his drink to the barista, she said vanilla latte, which he did correct at that point.\n\nI used to be a barista, and there really is no excuse for bad service like this. I could MAYBE understand a mistake happening once in awhile if you're working the bar and have 20+ cups lined up during the morning rush (not exaggerating), but for someone working the register to screw up and have lackluster personality to boot... not cool.\n\nI'm not sure I'll go back to this location again or not. Sometimes I feel it's just not worth the hassle after a couple bad experiences."
4,Professional ...OMG\nThis store is huge it's got a upstairs and down and it's super huge. The staff are professional and we got a ton of stuff because the staff working with us are nice and the stuff inside the store is so cute. \nThat's always a must and a plus. I took the advice of fellow yelpper Tyler B and asked for (Doc) turns out the man I was talking with was Doc (Giggles) and he's is so great. I picked out a living room set pictures to match a rug and even more. Such as plants and other items. \nBack in customer service the staff are kind & sweet and very helpful and polite. I will say if you happen to go inside ask for Doc.\nDoc is a peoples person he wont let you leave unsure or undecided he gives you time to make your mind up or change your mind about what u like what you want and that's is a plus. He says he loves how out spoken I am I'm polite but I say just whats on my mind. This location is fun and most of all your gonna love your new items. I would send my blind grand mother here I'm just being honest. These people are good trustworthy people who want to sale you cool stuff for you home.
4,"I love this place!  You can always find something great eat.  I recently went for a friends birthday.  I would recommend their outdoor dining area.  It's a pretty decent size and you will have to wait if you don't make reservations even during the week for lunch.  We had my favorite appetizer, the bacon wrapped dates.  I love the arugula salad that comes under the dates.  They also give you bread and olive oil pesto dip.  That's a meal in itself.  We ordered the chicken chopped salad which was delicious!  We told the waiter that all four of us were going to share so he brought it out already divided in four bowls.  We also had the margarita flat bread and the sweet potato cannelloni that was to die for!  We also ordered the cheeseburger that was cut into four as well.  The server also brought out a chocolate cake with ice cream for our friends birthday.  We experienced great customer service!  We will be back soon.  Probably for happy hour since it's a good one!"
1,I just wanted a smoothie so I went to Red Mango.  Great smoothies but the choices and options were limitless.  Quite honestly I felt very confused and overwhelmed by all the options. There is a self serve place and a full serve place and all kinds of crazyness.  I needed a Smoothie Concierge to steer me through all the options. Sadly all they had was some half stoned ASU student who could have cared less about being at work.
0,Sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting on peel and eat shrimp appetizer. Server kept saying it was on its way. Never got the appetizer and left as our entree was coming out. Seems to be bad communications between the FOH and BOH. I've been here many times before but it seems to be getting worse. I expressed my concerns to the food and beverage manager and she seemed receptive. I'll give it another chance and hope that next time I can write a better review.
2,Great beer selection and pretty good wings. Last time we got two large orders to go. They were over charred and tasted like they had been cooked on a dirty grill. Pretty yucky. Usually they have decent wings though.
1,This place is really strange. I received a free smoothie card which brought me here. They are not smoothies though. Smoothies have fruit and delicious ingredients. These are protein shakes made with water and powder. Yuck. Everyone who works there wants to talk to you. Very awkward. I'm giving two stars only because I didn't have to pay for this dismal experience.
0,"Worst service ever. Vegas is a service based city.  Bottle service is great, BUT only if you have a waitress.  Had 2 bottles, 4 people, and saw the waitress 3 times!  I did speak with a manager and he helped the bill total out a bit. NOT as much as I would have tho.  I will never go back, unless someone else is flipping the bill.  Best part was the fact I was surrounded by other VIP hosts from other clubs, and they all agreed, HORRIBLE SERVICE.  Real buzz kill to what would have been a great night....."
3,"So this place re-opens under new management as the all-new Wet'n'Wild water park in a week or two.  Sounds awesome if you look at their website and interactive map and a preview of all the thrill rides.  The landscaping looks to be much better too.  It's about time the hottest, fastest-growing and fifth largest city in the nation had an A-List theme park when SoCal has about ten alone!  When I see the Travel Chanel's \""Top Ten U.S. Water Parks\"" they blow all of ours away.  I hope they re-engineer the wave pool with rolling waves, so that you can ride them like at Big Surf, instead of the intermittent \""undulation\"" it had here before and at Golfland Sunsplash in Mesa.\n\nAlthough it wasn't opened its first year by June, it will run all the way until the end of October and season passes are discounted at $59.99 before opening day.  They can be purchased at their website address: http://phoenix.mywetnwild.com/\n\nFor the latest info regarding their grand opening and a chance to win free season passes you can also follow them through Twitter at http://twitter.com/wetnwildphx and become a friend on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phoenix-AZ/Wet-n-Wild-Waterpark/84174876135."
0,Yuck. How can any Mexican joint have absolutely no flavor in their meat? I really wanted to like this since it's close by and I'm all about 24 hour fast food! Bummer.
4,"I've been eating here since I was a kid and it was on 10th street. In fact, I used to live behind them and be tortured by the smells. When I used to travel with my boss, we would just order a bunch of falafel wraps to go from the woman that used to answer the phone by yelling, \""KASSAB!\"" Awesome roadtrip food. \n\nNow, more often, I get the portabella wrap. It's messy, but worth it and you can just eat the last few bits with a fork. Great pickled veggies and hummus.\n\nIt's gone more upscale since the old days, but also pricier. Oh well, glad they can survive the rents on Carson."
0,"Terrible service over the phone. I could barely get my order out before the lady cut me off to ask me \""is that all\"". The first time she did it I said \""let me finish\"" the second time I said \""I need to speak with a manager\"" she told me there weren't any managers available and hung up. Due to this experience I will not give my money to this business! So sad because its very close to my house."
4,"The food here is delicious, flavorful and colorful. This nice Indian buffet on the corner of Valley View and Sahara costs $11.00, and it's worth it. The restaurant has a nice elegant setting as well."
4,Always good and great lunch specials.
2,Good food overall but the storefront could use some work to make for a nicer dining experience. The place was clean and service was fine. I would absolutely order take out or delivery from here.
3,"Had lunch here the other day with a Groupon.  The staff as well as the chips and salsa were great.  The food was super.  The lunch deal included the entree as well as beans and rice and the portion was more than substantial.  The server (Carlos, I think) was super polite, very efficient and explained  what was contained in each item we ordered. A great Mexican place in this part of town."
1,"This Dunkin kinda sorta replaced the old one over on Liberty Avenue.  Good thing too, 'cos that one was kind of a dump.  \n\nDunkin's donuts are okay, but face it.  The only reason I ever come in here is to get the coffee.  Dunkin has bulk coffee and I actually like that better."
0,"Swanky capital of the world. \n\nIt's only M&S i kept saying to myself, as I was passed around from Customer Service rep to manager to checkout girl, each showing me nothing but contempt and making me feel like I wasn't welcome in the shop. \n\nI think it had something to do with my with Misfits t-shirt and my old trainers. I didn't know there was a dress code for buying a sandwich! \n\nTighter than Jenners, avoid."
2,"I'm sure the problem is with me...I'm on a salty kick at present and really crave brie and oysters and fresh salsa and (as usual) pho.  \n\nI drove 30 minutes to this place.\n\nNice, bright, modern interior. Friendly people. Beautifully laid out display of cookies and pastries and fudge and cakes.\n\nThe people ahead of me were buying red velvet cupcakes (naked) and gettting them iced to go. They looked fabulous. **\n\nI tried a raspberry linzer torte, Italian wedding cookies, a gingerbread man (welll,  his foot and part of his head, courtesy of my daughter), and a cream puff filled with custard.\n\nI didn't expect to like the coffee better than the pastries, but I did. \n\nThey were FINE, really. I'm sure most people would have been in love. Like I said, I'm sure it's me. It was just too sweet. \n\nNot going to drive that far, when I have a Fresh Market close at hand, and a Dean & Delucas within 10 minutes or so.\n\n**Edited to say:  I need to specify that the CUPCAKES were naked and looked fabulous, not the people. They were fully covered."
4,"Tropical smoothie is one of my favorite go to places. I always get health nut with soy protein instead. My family has tried almost everything. Everything is good except the sandwiches are smaller than expected. Every tropical smoothie is a franchise, therefore, happy hours and hours of operation varies. This location is the one I go to the most. Happy hour is from 5-7p.m. and it's buy 1 get 1 for $1.99. Tropical smoothie is a Vegas local spot. Check it out!"
1,"The restaurant has their old address on some sites- disconcerting. The atmosphere was cozy and there were many French speaking people there- a good sign for a French bistro. The server was pleasant but slow, our food took over an hour to get to us. The frog legs were bland and my dish was full of broccoli (which wasn't written on its description) I'm allergic to broccoli. The crepe, which I was so excited about because of the crepe machines in the front window, were cold and flavorless. We were disappointed with our meal considering its cost. We probably will not go back"
1,"This place is in serious need of an \""update\"".  \n\nThe bathroom is disgusting.  Wallpaper peeling off the wall, always dirty and for the men, only four stalls.  This is a busy United Club.  There are never any stalls open!\n\nWhere are the power outlets?  Good luck finding them.  Unless you go to the back \""office\"" area where there are two per station.  Out in the lounge area there are only a couple and people have to fight for them.\n\nThe bar & cleaning employees seem ho-hum.  They're obviously not excited about being there.\n\nThe United Employees working there are the one bright spot.  They're very good.\n\nNot much else to do in Denver when you're stuck but United really needs to go to work on these clubs in Denver."
4,This review is for the MAC makeup area in Nordstroms. Everyone needs to go see the lovely Whitney at MAC. She is a fabulous and friendly young lady who makes shoppinh for the right color so easy. She matched my skin color and tried out several different colors to find the right one. She was getting ready to leave for the night but still spent a ton of time with me showing me everything I asked for. I will be back here just for Whitney and for all my mac makeup :) Thanks Whitney!!
1,"we dined here on our first wedding anniversary. We had high expectations from this AAA 4 diamond and michelin rated restaurant. we chose this one in particular since the menu appealed the most to us.\n\nWhen we walked in at peak dining hour, we were surprised to find the restaurant so empty (not that we mind). En route to the restaurant we did find a lot of activity at other bellagio restaurants which makes me wonder why this place did not attract any crowds. The location is also not as attractive as the other bellagio restaurants facing the musical fountains.\n\nThe cocktail we ordered on our server's recommendation was the most disappointing $14 cocktail I've ever had. It just tasted like cucumber water.\n\nWe always wanted to try the hamachi crudo and decided to give it a shot. It comes with green apple, winter black truffle, tempura crunch. Everything combined it was very tasty with the tempura providing the crunchy texture.\n\nOur server recommended \""three seas\"" tasting of japanese fish, bamboo rice, ginger vinaigrette so went for it. There was scallop, hamachi and snapper. They all tasted the same since the ginger vinaigrette was too overpowering. Paying $45 for that dish was a complete waste of money.\n\nWe had the TRUFFLE-STUFFED CHICKEN with SAVOY CABBAGE, SUNCHOKE-PEAR PUR\u00c9E, FOI GRAS RICE. There were hardly any truffles to be found in the chicken. moreover, the chicken itself was bland and unseasoned. The savoy cabbage had some flavor and foi gras rice was probably the star of the dish. \n\nFor a michelin rated restaurant, the food fell short of expectations. I've dined at a lot of fine dining restaurants and have had better bang for the buck than here."
4,"BRAVO!  I was so impressed by this show. First of all when you walk into the Wynn you feel like a million bucks and this venue is no different.  The music, the lighting, the water, and the stunts were amazing!  I am definitely going back to Le Reve the next time I go to Vegas.  I like how the seating is round so practically every seat is a great seat.  If you sit too close in the \""Splash Zone\"" you will get wet."
0,"Terrible experience and service! If you order food during happy hour, check the pricing! The waitress wouldn't correct her mistake and kept on giving excuses. Not cool...."
3,Love the outdoor patio!  The perfect venue for relaxing with music and a cold beer.
3,"A good place if you want a decent burger. Wouldn't say it is the best burger I have ever had, however, it is tasty and hearty and the veggies (lettuce, tomato, etc) always taste fresh. I like that large amount of toppings to choose from. Prices are decent for what you get. A tip: I have heard that their regular burgers are huge so I always order the Jr burger and its more than enough. Also, the smalls fries are basically like a large at most other places so i don't even wanna picture what the large looks like. Atmosphere is clean and service is pretty quick. Like I said, a decent place for a burger in this neck of the woods."
2,"There seems to be only one listing for this place here on Yelp, but to be accurate (as some others have noted) there are two places, the fancier and pricier Valentino and the more casual and cheaper Grill @ Valentino, we were considering taking in the fine dining option, but after viewing the menu, we just weren't feeling anything, so we went with the grill.\n\nService was a bit spotty, our waiter brought our water and immediately  asked about our wine selection, before we had gotten a chance to view the list. Then, after bringing us our appetizer and salad course, was nowhere to be found when we wanted to order entrees. \n\nThe food, however, was very good. This place boasts one the best alfredo sauces I've had on the strip, and while it's not a particularly fancy option, it's something that many places don't do that well. Caesar salad was crisp and light and everything was generally what you'd expect from a casual italian place"
4,Great quality at good prices. I was the only and first one to use a coupon. Elyse was awesome!
4,"This restaurant is fantastic!!! The food is always great and our go-to place for Chinese!! We order so much that the delivery guy already knows, how to get to my house and my dog by name! We have zero complaints about this place. They deliver all the way to my house on Sig Butte/Southern. Just great service all the time. Owner did deliver once when they confused the plates, but no worries, they fixed it instantly. A must try in East Mesa!!!\n\nBTW: I just called right now to place an order and the guy recognized my voice/address and knew what we wanted!!"
2,"I've been here about four times.  I've had the fish tacos more than once, and they are pretty good, though I don't care too much for the cream sauce they douse them with on occasion.  \n\nThe slow-roasted pork burrito is delicious.  \n\nTheir refried beans and rice are pretty good.  They aren't bland like they are at many other restaurants.  \n\nThe guacamole is not very good.  Two of the times I ordered it, it came out in some strange brownish, grayish color.  Expensive, too.  $3-4 for nothing more than three or four tablespoons.\n\nThe prices overall are pretty expensive for a Mexican restaurant.  I'm not sure what it is with restaurants like this but MEXICAN FOOD IS NOT MEANT TO BE EXPENSIVE.  It is predominantly made from beans, rice, corn, flour, onions, tomatoes, peppers, and a little bit of meat.  So, why are we paying $13 for an entre?\n\nThe atmosphere inside is awesome.  Just what you'd expect from a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint (which, oddly enough, is in a strip mall).  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  nice choice for a meal, though I think you can do better for the price (or just as good for cheaper)."
4,"Awesome bulgogi tacos! Chef didn't have Kim chi so he whipped up some Asian slaw for my friend. I had the New Mexico burger w/garlic fries, which were delicious! Brought home a pastrami sandwich w/garlic fries for the hubby. They must have been good because the only crumbs left were the ones on his shirt! Will definitely be back!"
2,Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n7 Food\n8 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n7 Value
0,"The good- I had a groupon so I didn't have to pay full price for the bland dishes consumed by my daughter and neice. \n\nThe bad- I ordered the blackened seafood. The sea bass was overcooked (rubbery). The scallops were undercooked (one under one over). The mashed potatoes were AWFUL, taste like boxed mashed potatoes with a few lumps to try to fool you into thinking they were homemade. Nothing like the ones in the picture. \n\nThe ugly- our waiter smelled like she had been out drinking ALL night (it was 5 in the evening). D'angela (the chick that answered the phone) was not friendly at all. \n\nGroupon free meal or complimentary appetizer..nothing will get me back in the door."
2,"I don't usually review chains, but $8 hot n ready deep dish pizza is seriously good. And only $8!\nDemand was so high on a Thursday night that they kept running out - the stuff coming out of the oven was literally hot and ready!"
4,I looked them up on Yelp and called ECO Tint first thing in the morning. \nI showed up to a very clean and neat shop. The waiting room was great with Wi-Fi.\nThey were very nice people to deal with and the quality was great. They tinted our van windows in a couple hours with not problems. The quality of the job was very good and they price was great. I lifetime warranty on the job is also good.\nOverall these guys deserve 5 stars. Good Job and thanks for the quality job on our new van.
2,A nice place for a quick business lunch in Fort Mill or just a quick drive up from Rock Hill. \nGrouper is always nice as is the southern style crab cakes.\n\nService is always pleasant and friendly and have taken the daughter in for a lunch and they are definitely kid friendly.
1,"I've been here a couple of times and the only thing that pops into my head is MEH. The BBQ Sauce is meh and leaves a nasty lingering after taste. The Rib Tip platter is ok, nothing to get too excited about this place. Meh, I've experienced better."
2,"The decor was very nice and the place is spacious. \n\nUnfortunately, this place was empty. But that meant the sushi chef will take his time and cater to us.  Our server was a korean lady, she seemed a little gruff but topped our drinks often. \n\nJoey, the sushi chef was very nice.  So nice, he gave us tips on other sushi joints he frequents.  \n\nFood was prepared nicely and fish tasted fresh but there was nothing special about this place that sets them apart from the many sushi restaurants here in Las Vegas."
4,The food was great and service was fast.  Place was very busy on a Wednesday evening and they accommodated us for 3 without any reservations.  Highly recommend making this a stop while in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.
3,"Mister Steer is a Montreal institution. Once voted to have the best burgers in Montreal . The interior has a dated 70's diner feel to it. \n\nOnce you are seated - be prepared to get a green salad. There's no way to say no to it. The waitress will serve it to you immediately (I see the salad as a good introduction to the grease that's about to come...) and you have only 1 choice of dressing: French (never asked if you can have ranch..)\n\nMr. Steer is known for their ball burgers. What I mean by this is that the meat is not shaped into a flat patty - but rather a ball. It cooks nice and evenly on the outside. The only way to order a burger here is medium - anything else and you are loosing out on the flavour. \n\nAnother great item here are the Suzie Q fries. These are curly fries that you can get with your burger. The fries are a hit or miss. Sometimes they are served nice and crispy, other times they are warm and taste like they have been waiting for my burger under a hot-lamp. \n\nIf you are visiting - make a point to stop off here. It's a downtown landmark. If you are a local and have never been, what's stopping you?"
1,"Alright W, I've got bones to pick. I've been a customer at the W several times, and it seems like every time I go there is some kind of issue. Whether it's with the room, or whether its with how many guests we are permitted to have at our very expensive table...there's always something. When I come to the W, I expect to spend money. No complaints about that, I know that when I head to the W that I am going to drop some dough on whatever it is we are doing. Got it. What I don't understand is the sub-par customer service for a place that spouts \""Whatever, Whenever\"". For example, My friends and I purchased a table in the night club. There was only three of us at the table, and we got constantly heckled by the door people and the management about the rest of our party showing up who were in another vehicle. Im sorry, but 3 people to a bottle of champagne and a bottle of vodka?! We would have been absolutely hammered. Furthermore, there were only 3 other guests that were looking to join us. It's not like I invited 10 more people, but they seriously wanted to get into it with me over a total of 6 guests at this table in their nightclub. Hello? Are you serious? Any other nightclub in Scottsdale would have happily accommodated 6 guests to a table.  Not to mention that aside from purchasing the table, my other friend also purchased a room for the night. The W has a very nice decor, and a great selection of alcohol and food, but again the management of the place is not up to par for the prices you are paying."
3,"Fish and Chips anyone? Had that and the quesadilla last night, both were delicious, but i'll admit I feel a little sluggish today. Place was clean, well kept, nice waitress. We went on a quiz or trivia night, so the mood was pretty mello. Tap beers seemed pretty standard for a pub. I will definitely go back for a nightcap as it is an easy walk from my house."
2,"I was slightly hesitant in eating here again because the last time I ate here, I threw up. This time around, I got the tomato basil soup and chopped salad. The food was pretty good and the service was okay. I probably wont be back here, primarily because a lot of the dishes were so damn expensive."
4,"XS is my favorite nightclub in Vegas. Located in the new Wynn extension, Encore, the club defines \""excess\"" to the fullest. I'm talkin' at least 40 tables, 15 dancing poles, 6 go-go dancers, 3 fully-stocked bars, and an even ratio of hot staff--one guy, one girl per table to cater your every need. \n\nNow, if you know me, you know that Steve Wynn is my hero. The Wynn is by far my favorite hotel in Vegas; the architecture, d\u00e9cor, atmosphere, dining, boutiques, pool, day/nightlife--the full package. And the Wynn nightclub, Tryst, is unbelievably cool. I mean...to have a damn WATERFALL up in the club? You can't get more excessive than that. \n\nApparently, Steve Wynn can.\n\nXS doesn't have a waterfall, but it does offer a massive outdoor patio area. Complete with a mote-like pool, cabanas, and a gambling section! It was freezing the night we went, so no pool action. Given how cold it was, I felt for the dealers stuck outside, but they were in cute weather-appropriate snow bunny outfits, so that was good.\n\nBack inside, the spacious dance floor was filled to the rim. The music was Top 40's as expected, mashed up with a little house/dance/techno. Normally I'm put off by Vegas go-go dancers (more strip club than nightclub), but these dancers were naturally pretty and fit girls, with matching outfits that I wouldn't mind wearing myself. \n\nI'll definitely be back in the summertime, as I foresee tons of mischief going on in their outdoor pool. Watch out, Rehab/Tao Beach/Palms."
4,"As a huge fan of the Phoenix location and now a resident of Old Town Scottsdale, I was beyond stoked to know that I live less than 2 miles away from the new location. Dana is a great owner and the staff at both locations are amazing. Location in Old Town is perfect and the decor is always on point, I would totally live on the patio! As a vegetarian, their menu stands out for me compared to other restaurants. I can't get enough of their Big Sur Black Bean Burger. You may be thinking, \""Grrrrreat. ANOTHER veggie burger for the non meat people\"".. No way, this burger is perfect, not bland and is AWESOME with added avocado. The tofu tacos and bowls are fantastic too. To the reviewer who said that everything was a little spicy.. Well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble but it is pacific islander style food. It's meant to have a kick and boy does it rule. The drink list is a lot of fun as well, I always look forward to a Tiki Bastard or good old fashion Zombie! Thanks Hula's, you have a regular for as long as I'm in Arizona :)"
4,Best sushi in town. Sad it's such a small location because I'm impatient when it comes to waiting! The Green Valley is my personal favorite!
1,I ordered the shrimp pad thai to go. It's a lot for one person. I liked it though but they didn't add a lot of shrimp. Just like maybe four???... And the shrimp wasn't that good. My husband also ordered the teriyaki chicken. He was very disappointed. Not that much chicken. Everything was filled with vegetables on the bottom. And a couple pieces of chicken on top.
1,"Sorry 2 stars, that's it from me. One go to the guy who makes omelet and pasta, the other star go to convenient that gives after long day at pool. \nI ask for a cup of coffee to waitress lady and she forget to bring it to me, WTH. With the price that they charged is not cheap and the varieties they provide was just an average. This is our second time here and will not go back again. \nHope Mandalay Bay Hotel decide to change to different buffet..."
2,If you go here when its busy it's usually a bit under staffed. The sushi here is average but they do put there own twist on it. They add a little liquid smoke to all of there sushi sauces which adds a little variety. The first time I went here was about a year and a half ago and I wasn't to impressed with the sushi. My friend went back a month after that and they had gotten rid of sushi all together. Just recently they started serving sushi again so I decided to go back and try it and it was fantastic. Flavors are very different from most other sushi joint but I enjoyed it. They do a 19.95 all you can eat sushi.
1,"I ordered the T-bone and eggs. The food wasn't the best, especially hash browns and toast. The hash browns were extremely bland and a little burnt. Speaking of burnt, the toast was. One side was charred while the other was slightly burnt. As for the T-bone, i asked for medium and got well-cooked. It was dry but A1 sauce helped a little. The only safe thing was the eggs. But a little later I got a stomach ache. Although I wasn't happy  I gave a 2 star because I've had worse."
2,"Just ok.  Went in with coworkers. Good vibe, decent band, and fun crowd.  Ordered a few appetizers; steak bites and wings.  Flavorless!  Ever salt chicken wings!  If you go here,  have a cocktail, listen to tunes, and skip the food!"
4,"Came here for lunch yest.  Right from the get-go I liked this place.  It's been awhile since I had to parallel park.  The outside gave a cozy feel to it.  I wouldn't expect it around this side of town, took me by surprise.\n\nWalking in, I was greeted by Una hermosa, Gladys.  The waitress, who i found is the daughter of the owner, suggested I try the Carnitas, since it was her grandma's recipe.  Simply delicious!!! The plate was topped with chicharron, and the pork fell apart with my fork.  Also tried the chocolate cake, which was very thick and rich.  \n\nWould definitely love to come back and try the tamales."
4,"Two words: THE PIE.\n\nGet the apple. It's monstrously large and possibly the best I've ever had, and I'm pretty picky. It comes warm, and you can have it \u00e0 la mode for no extra charge. It's not filled with that weird sickly-sweet goo-- just tons of apples and cinnamon. And love. \n\nHoly crap. I dream about it.\n\nMy friend also swears by the key lime, though I haven't had it yet. Be sure to ask your waiter for that day's pie list, because their pastry chef likes to mix things up. (And yes, according to the waitstaff, this diner has a pastry-school-trained chef on pie duty. And it shows.)\n\nSucker Punch continues to be my new default location for casual meals/beer/meetings and combinations of all three... To those of us who keep odd hours, it's been a godsend--I think the whole graduate contingent of the ASU theater program may just move right in one of these days.  \n\nSince my last review, I've probably been there about 10 more times, and I haven't had a bad meal yet. Most importantly, there's room enough to sit and talk, and it's not too loud to think (especially on non-weekend nights). The wifi's been reliable, and lately the music selection has been awesome, too.  Ok, so the service isn't always perfect, but everyone's friendly and apologetic, and it all comes out in the wash.\n\nBut really... Just come for the pie. You won't regret it."
1,"The food was fresh, and tasted great.  However, for almost $50, I received a piece of fish less than 3 ounces.  The dish had no side, literally nothing else on the plate excpet garnish.  We skipped desert and got a yogurt next door for $6.  Dont waste your time here."
1,"The food here looks better than it tastes. I have eaten here a handful of times, and the last time was the LAST time. \n\nI am very flexible and adventurous when it comes to dining, and have very few hangups when it comes to food. While I am fully aware that there are many breaded and deep fried items in different Asian and Pacific Island foods that have bones in them, I personally did not expect to bite into a breaded piece of chicken Katsu with a little bone in the end. I almost broke a tooth! I am sure this is normal, but my favorite joint, Ma'i Island grill did not have the bone-in variety, and I just wasn't expecting it. \n\nMoving on, the flavor of every dish I have had here has been lacking. They have a wide variety of sides to choose from, but most of them seem like canned food items that were dumped into a display case. No complex flavors, nothing to write home about. \n\nOne of the most disappointing items on the menu is the macaroni salad. It isn't bad, but when I go to eat Hawaiian, this is something I look forward to, and it is plain and bland here. \n\nI have heard the Korean food is good here, but it is pressented as a Hawaiian food place, so...\n\nAll in all, there are better choices when looking for Hawaiian dining, just Yelp it out till you find one worth going to."
1,"Well after watching any Cirque Du Soleil show, you've seen it all, I really wished they used some new ideas instead of recycling old acts from previous shows and placing them all into Zarkana. Lady juggling balls, the big Ring, Chair balancing??? I think the highlight of this show was the lady who creates art with sand --- that was an amazing.\nI don't know why they ever got rid of Elvis, I thought that was a Good show, Great music, fun up beat and they had a stripper poll which I thought was different from the other Cirque Du Soleil and you get to see a hot looking young Elvis all night.\n\nIf you were to see a Cirque Du Soleil show I would just go to \""O\"" I don't think anything can top that."
2,"I came here to celebrate with a friend after my last presentation for a class. This restaurant is pretty neat, however past experiences here has made me feel iffy here.\n\nThis time around, it wasn't so bad. I ordered the titanic with the French dip to dunk it in. Last time it took forever for the food to come out, but this time it was around 10 min. \n\nThe food was pretty fresh, and they have a lot of choices in sandwiches. Take your time and read all the combinations. This restaurant is also neatly located right near campus, and their drinks aren't too bad. Depending on what you're trying to drink and what is for the special this place isn't bad.\n\nI had two coronas (2.95 on Wednesdays) so yeah, not bad."
1,"I got myt first pair of orthotics with this place back in 2001. Back then, I felt like a valued client, and they almost had me believe that they were foot specialists or podiatrists. I paid a little over $100 for two pairs.\nHowever, I visited the same location yesterday and explained that I could not find my inserts so I bought the shoes instead paying $600 for what I had purchased once a long time ago. Yet the shoes were still $130.00. I specifically asked for slip-resistant shoes and felt like being at a roller rink passing through the kitchen. \nI returned this morning, and the male attendant with a feux hawk decided to quote manufacturer's words to me when I tried to return the shoes, or exchange them within 2 sentences of our conversation.\nSo if it wasn't for their overpriced and prescribed inserts not from someone who has a degree in sports medicine, it would be for the careless treatment I received that I am submitting a low but generous score to the only surviving location in Clark County.\nI should add that female that I initially bought products from yesterday, was polite but said that their products would last 5 to 8 months at best, which is piss poor for $130.00."
3,"Well, what to say... Almost all the reviewers have hit the nail on the head.  If you love poke, think you might want to try poke, don't event know what poke is - go to Poke Express and fall in love with some of the best poke on the planet.  And great prices to boot.\n\nIf its your first time, its a little confusing to figure out - since its really 3 restaurants under one roof.  Only problem is their hours - they close too early"
2,Must visit if your in downtown Montreal! Atmosphere is welcoming. Music is good and upstairs has outdoor lounging. The only problem is the bar gets very crowded as well as the dance floor which makes it difficult to maneuver because the people don't move for shit
1,"It was fun, but every plate was very very bland.  I was visiting for a week and decided to try this place based on the reviews.  Absolutely not worth the price.  The Foie Gras was the only thing worth anything in the place."
3,The food here is very unique yummy fusion between Mexican & Chinese. Have to try it to believe it! very laid back & I got to have a glass of wine with my dinner. Im def a fan
1,"So to start off any casino cafe they serves Chinese food as well as burgers and breakfast seems a bit fishy, but anyway we gave it a try and it was a bad decision, first of all they were having a drawing in the casino over a loud speaker, so loud the waitress couldn't hear our orders, which was very irritating, secondly the waitress was very stubborn, so NO SUBSTITUTIONS, no matter what! The reason this place even deserves 1 star is the ambiance, the restaurant interior is well decorated, ill give them that, however the food, which took about 50 mins to arrive was actually ok, nothing great but not completely terrible either, the omelette i had was alright pretty much what you'd expect from a cafe but the hash browns were white, not cooked properly and all soggy, only after drenching them in ketchup were they consumable. All in all this place was a bad choice, didn't try the Chinese food, probably shouldn't either because i mean if they couldn't get basic cafe food right i don't want to imagine how they would ruin much more complex Chinese food."
3,Authentic Irish feel with a friendly staff and warm atmosphere. Expected selection of draft beers for an Irish Pub. Good selection of bottled beers.
2,"Stick with the Chinese at KOJI.  the Sushi sucks!\n\nI've eaten here many times, but always ordered from the Chinese menu.\nTheir wonton soup is among the best i've ever had,  lots of meat and wontons.  Their noodles and rice are spectacular too.\n\nThe other day I sat at the Sushi bar and ordered a simple Crunch Roll with Soy paper as I like.  it was terrible!!  All loose and falling apart, unevenly cut,  cucumber NOT peeled, YUCK.  DRY!  Had i not seen the guy make it myself i would have thought it had been in the fridge a week.\n\nso.....stick with the Chinese at KOJI"
1,"Firehouse just didn't do it for me... Stopped in for lunch at this Firehouse Subs after spending the morning getting to know Charlotte. The place was pretty busy, as it was during the peak lunch hour. I was in the mood for a salad, and since there was only one on the menu, my choice was made for me. I got to pick the protein though. I chose the tuna salad. The boyfriend got the hook & ladder combo (cute). We were both amused by the large selection of hot sauces that were available (we both LOVE spicy food & hot sauce). I was largely underwhelmed with the salad, which consisted of large leafs of lettuce, a few thick bell pepper slices and a large wedges of tomato. It was topped with three sizable scoops of tuna salad and provolone cheese slices. I just wasn't psyched on the salad at all. Yes, I know I'm at a sub shop ordering a salad, but it really isn't that hard to throw a decent salad together. The boyfriend said his sub was meh. I personally prefer Which Wich."
4,"Best Italian food we've had in AZ! Attentive, efficient, and friendly service and an open-kitchen concept, plus an outside patio. It's at the tip of the Scottsdale Airport runway, not easy to find, but so worth it!!\n\nThey start you with a fresh-baked, piping-hot pillow of Foccacia bread with seasoned olive oil to dip it in. The Eggplant Rolletini appetizer was a special tonight, and thanks to another Yelp recommendation, we ordered it and it was out of this world. \n\nWe also had Lasagna (terrific) and the Filet Mignon Saltimbocca special with prosciutto, melted fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, and a marsala sauce with roasted potatoes to soak up the delicious sauce. Yummy tiramisu and slam-dunk Canollis. Everything tastes so fresh and delicious, head and shoulders above the Italian chains. \n\nYou need to try this place! : )"
1,The coffee is fine.  I am very thrown by the fact the don't have any center or sugar for taking.   Their poor costumer service skills is the single reason I do nor plan on caffinate here again.  They yell at their customers which is just poor business altogether.
3,"Solid. Not out of this world, but Thai Taste is solid.  The prices are reasonable, and whenever I need my Pad See Ew fix, I'll head to TT.  There are restaurants light years better in Boston and Chicago, but for now, TT will do. \n\nThe ambiance is kind of old school, tables with plastic covers the random wood-carving, and a hammock hanging from the ceiling with a fake person napping inside.  It's not my favorite, but hey, it adds to the charm. \n\nSince this place has been reviewed so many times, I'll just give my 2-cent tip. Lunch specials are a great value.  For about $6 or $7 bucks, depending on the protein you pick, you'll get an entree (some with rice), a spring roll, soup and iced tea.  (Iced tea and soup not included if you get lunch special take out.) \n\nI've gotten the squash special, which is stir-fried yellow squash and protein of choice...that was an insane $12.95 by comparison.  (The dish itself was OK, not as flavorful as the Pad See Ew and the squash for some reason had a squeaky sound whenever I bit into them.) \n\nOverall, it's a nice neighborhood joint where the service is good, and you will have a good meal.  Maybe not stellar, out-of-this-world great (like Paula Deen would say) but you'll leave happy and very full."
0,"I'll be short here.........Ummm NO.  As most people quote, yah the decor is nice...Well guess who's paying for that?  The consumer hence the overpriced drinks...Guess the concept works its always packed..."
1,"WORST PULLED PORK, EVER!!  Didn't touch it...complained to manager...still for charged.\n\nDecent collards, however."
0,"Did not want to give one star. Horrible service, grouchy servers..... Worst service ive ever had. Do your family a favor.... Don't eat at golden china..... Especially if your Hispanic"
0,"One word: EEW!  If you're not staying in a 'GO' room... Just say No! Our delux room had stains all over the carpets, furniture that was beaten and chipped, and a college dorm fridge that was warm and set on the floor randomly in our room.\nWhen we called to ask for a different room they told us 'no' and pretty much told us to leave if we didnt like it. \nThank you 'Leah', room assignments, you drove us to the Mandalay Bay where we are soooooo much happier for just $50 more!!! They are great to us here and our room isnt dark, depressing, or look like a crime scene.\nI guess 'thats what you get for waking up in Flamingo Hilton! '"
3,"@ Skip B.  I read the inspection report from 1/24/11 and didn't see anything too serious on there.   There were 5 critical items mentioned.  One was for no date on portioned salad dressings.  I assume \""portioned\"" refers to when you pour dressing from the main container into a secondary container for daily use.  The second was for putting fish and fries at convenient locations during lunch rush.  The third was something about the ice drain line, fourth  was some air gap issue with the drive through window, and the last was for a bag of ice melt being stored on the same shelf as food.  When I see a score of 31 I expect there to be spoiled food, dirty/sick employees, rodent infestations and the like.  These are hardly reasons for me to stop enjoying my guilty cheap burger and fry pleasure.  \n\nWith the previous rant review addressed this place is the best alternative to fast food burger chains.  I have had their burgers, chicken fries, fried okra (!), and fish.  Their fish is surprisingly yummy and burgers should be ordered doubled and split with a friend.   My biggest complaint is that they don't have root beer or ginger ale.  As a result I never order a drink."
2,"My mom gets a bigger kick out of this place than I do. It seemed to specialize in upholstery, and the walls are lined with swatches. I did like that the woman allowed me to take mini-swatches off of the wall, but I didn't wind up finding any fabrics that worked for my projects. I'll definitely try back here."
4,Ace.  Don't fool yourself the workouts are tough as hell.  Be very present with your current level of fitness. It is easy to get caught up in the energy and excitement brought to the classes by the instructors. Its better to sit out part of the workout that to injure yourself trying to keep up. I have done personal training here as well and it helped me immensely.  I was in a lot of pain after a bike/car accident and they were able to use Yoga and Kettle-bells to get me better in a very short amount of time.  Top Notch instruction and fitness made fun.
1,"DLUX is a restaurant that is still struggling to figure out what it would like to be.  I have been twice and both times left me wanting. \n\nPros:\n\n- The interior is beautiful.  I LOVE looking at the bar.\n- The sweet potato fries are nothing to write home about alone, but are delicious with the siracha mayo.  \n- The service is friendly, but green. \n- Seating was immediate.\n- Plenty of ramp parking not too far away\n\nCons:\n\n- The food was unremarkable.  It wasn't bad by any means, but easily forgotten.  I really appreciate that DLUX took a chance with the vegetarian white bean burger, but it was lost in the bun.   \n\n-  The music was far too loud at night.  It was at a level that would have been fine if it was full of bar patrons, but the restaurant was almost empty.   It resulted in a lot of shouting to waiters and dining companions.\n\n- The toasted marshmallow milkshake was a total loss.  The milkshake had the consistency of water.  And, the marshmallow is not toasted - it is burnt.  It took a couple of hours to clear the ash taste out of the mouth.  The pecan milkshake was rich, but watery and unremarkable.\n\n- I know this is a bit nit picky, but the lighting did not transition to dinner at the right time.  It felt like we were eating in a cafeteria until the lighting changed.  Then, the atmosphere was much better.\n\nOverall:\n\nIt is an easily forgettable, unoffensive place for a quick first date with an internet connection.  There are just too many other great places nearby to go back to DLUX again."
2,"You should come here to enjoy the atmosphere and to see what the hype is all about. Order a frozen hot chocolate and you've experienced the same Serendipity experience there is to the one in NY. Maybe, not quite since that one is a little shack. Mind you, this frozen treat is super sweet and even though you'll most likely share it with another human being, your'e bound to finish only half of it and leave a bunch of whipped cream behind.\n\nTheir food is so-so...typical food you'd find at a TGIF or any other place that serves typical American \""bar food.\"" Loaded potato skins for $11? Who are you kidding? Extremely dry chicken dijon pizza for $14? Don't even think about it...you're better off buying frozen pizza and sticking it in the oven yourself. \n\nLike I said, people come here for the experience and for that, it gets 3 stars! There's just something so 'cool' about the ambiance. It makes us ladies feel special! :)"
4,"Fantastic meal, great decor, and excellent drinks - need I say more?.?.?  Ok here goes.  The Caeser Salad had Pig Ear, Pickled Okra, and a Fried Egg that gooed out to make a warm compliment to the light dressing... Fantastic.  The mussels had bacon, salmon roe, and fennel... What how do those thing go together, extremely well that's how.  Hangar steak had some nice bitter micro greens, uber crispy potatoes, and a nice bright sauce to pull it all together... Drinks were unique, especially my barrel aged Buffalo Trace Manhattan.  Booooom.  If you are in Pitt, go here... the end."
2,"Nice rooftop deck. They don't have many beers, but some different mix drinks made up for it."
3,"This was a spur of the moment idea and although it looks good, it's not diet friendly.  I love a good outdoor market and this a small assortment of booths, everything from bakery goods, to fruits and veggies.  But, there are too many tempting items that are just full of sugar and I must watch my sugar.  My husband and I are constantly watching out for that and it's not that we do not eat sugar, but most of the time we save it for a special time, this was not one of them.\n\nWhat we saw did look inviting and very worth a return trip, on a day when sugar doesn't matter.  I wish it would grow and get even bigger, but then again, we do live in a desert and not too many fresh veggie farms around here!"
0,"Ok so I decided that I should just contact cooperate concerning how I was treated and how the other customers were being ignored as well.  They took my complaint and informed me that the store manager would contact me back.  She did, and I found out her father was from my city back in Michigan. \n\nShe was mortified to hear how I was treated and informed me that is why she was transfered from California, to change the way the staff interacted with their customers. \n\nBecause of my hassle she told me she would send over some in home specialist to help me with my bedroom and give me ideas and have a lot of stuff to show me.  When they arrived, they arrived later than the appointment I set up, by like 3 hours.  They also did not have anything prepared and came equipped with an out dated catalogue and a tote bag full of wood chips to show colors.  \n\nThey noticed that I had the current catalogue which they did not even have in the store yet and basically let me do all of the talking, when they left, I still did not know what to do with my room and to top it all off they STOLE my new catalogue! \n\nWTF?!  SERIOUSLY?!!  LOL how pathetic!  Screw you West Elm!!"
3,"Believe me, I'd rather stay @ Wynn or Bellagio or the Venetian, but this place comps me when my comps @ better casinos expire...\n\nI recommend getting a room on the 9th floor, because it's the first floor the elevators to the right stops @ and one can use the elevators to the left that run from floors 1-9.   And get a room near the elevator.  One walks enough in casinos and in Vegas in general.  Having a room near the elevator is a blessing after a hard night of gambling and partying...\n\nIn the past, with your $5 per day resort fee, one had access to the locker room in the spa.  Now, there's a $10 fee per day.  It's a good place to take a sauna and a whirlpool, in addition to a shave.   The workout area is still gratis with your resort fee.  It's serviceable...\n\nThe rooms provide good soap, but the shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizer are fair @ best.  One needs good moisturizer in the desert...\n\nThe rooms aren't fancy, but comfortable with a small couch and a coffee table.   \n\nA coffee maker is provided in the room.  Housekeeping replenishes the coffee every day.\n\nLocal calls are free with your resort fee.  \n\nThe closet space is huge, but they could provide more hangers.   \n\nThe Orleans has a decent poker room and their comp rate is $1.25 per hour for four hours and after that it's 50 cents an hour.\n\nThe sports book is fair @ best.  \n\nThe French Market Buffet is fair @ best.  Most of the time, I eat there free...  \n\nThe 24 Hour Courtyard Cafe has some decent specials, but the service is horribly slow...\n\nI enjoy staying @ the Orleans and they've already sent me another comp two days after returning from Vegas..."
4,"This place really is as good as it gets.  The food is spectacular, the fried rice is amazing and we always get the filet and it truly is melt in your mouth.  Great fun and close to home.  The east valley is lucky to have Osaka here!!  Go check it out"
4,"My friend and I took advantage of Groupon deal with 702, and we are so happy we did!  Brian and Race were so awesome!!  It was my first time in a helicopter, and I am afraid of heights, but I was not scared during the flight at all.  It was really awesome to fly over the strip at night, and Brian was a friendly pilot/tour guide.  The only thing was, when we received the comedy magic show tickets, the expiration date was written incorrectly but Brian emailed me and let me know that he will absolutely take care of this for us the next time we return to Vegas.\n\nTHANK YOU!!!"
3,"Being on a No Meat Diet makes you think outside the box sometimes when your accustomed to being an omnivore.....so, when we were looking around for a place to grab some lunch a friend suggested we stop by Sweet Tomatoes.  It has been over 10 yrs since I've been to one, so I thought why not.\n\nWe arrived just before the lunch rush at 11:30 am.  There was a short line, but nothing crazy.  I piled a bunch of Salad and Pasta Salad on my plate and then made the rounds over to the Bread section.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=jRysLhaB-0yg5Wa2EYYQsw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=L3xqRAzbnoT7e2khkOUW6w\nThe food was very good, tasty and satisfying.

1,"The food was decent at best,  service was awful.  Lazy host, slow service,  mediocre food.  I would not go back to this location.  Management needs to work on the customer service for this restaurant!!!"
1,"This is a review of my lunch experience.  I had lunch with two friends last week and JDS completely failed on both service and food.  From being seated to the time we got our check was one hour and fifteen minutes.  Really, for lunch?  In fact, one of my guests took about three bites, asked for a box and almost immediately had to take her lunch with her back to her office.  Oh I forgot, my other guest ordered a plain hamburger, well done, on just a bun.  This is how he always orders a hamburger, so he is always very clear with his order, he knows is not common.  Pretty easy, right?  Instead, he gets a cheeseburger with some lettuce.  Wrong!  I got a simple steak sandwich at a steak house, and it was just plain bad.  No flavor, absolutely no flavor.  There was one highlight, the french onion soup.  It was very good.  Overall, an incredibly disappointing experience all around.  I would be very reluctant to go back for lunch."
3,"I think the other reviews are unfair.  This place does not pretend to be a high-end eatery.  The food is for college kids who working through a hangover or need to load up for an all-nighter.  That said, this place does the job.  I stopped there after a long car ride from BMI airport.  I was starving so everything tasted good (though  also had to remove a good amount of the fries to eat the sandwich like another reviewer).  It did take a really long time to get the sandwich even though the place only had 1 or 2 other customers.   I had no problem with the bathrooms but I imagine they are in worse shape on the weekends after everyone's been out to the bar.\nThey have rolls of paper towels at the tables instead of typical paper napkins.  I did have to use a lot of them after unwrapping my sandwich.\n\nBasically a 2 star type of restaurant; sandwich shop/fast food, but it does a 4 star job of it.  Good, but the food could use a little more 'engineering' to taste better vs just paying for a lot of calories."
4,"OK I'm getting straight to the point Ciao Ciao's is as good as it gets.  This pizza joint leaves you 100% completely satisfied in every aspect of your dinning experience.  The ambiance is fun and unpretentious, the service is friendly and helpful, and last but not least the food was absolutely amazing.  Ciao Ciao's has earned my loyalty. I will only eat pizza here from now on, and considering I live 13 miles away from Ciao Ciao's that's saying a lot. \n\nNow how do I even begin to describe the one delicious brick oven fired rich meaty concoction that will forever plague me with an eternal raging hunger erection. How can words even do justice in accurately portraying the rich creamy clouds of ricotta cheese, the carnivorous festival of pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs layered about providing you with a new and exciting flavor combination with every single bite. The fact of the matter is, that I can't. I can't begin to describe how truly good this pizza really is. The only thing you can do is experience it for yourself. Drop whatever it is that you are doing right now.  Go to Ciao Ciao, order a pie, and insert it into that large flapping hole in your face with the lips and teeth and go ....MMMMMMM.\n\nCiao Ciao is the best place to get pizza in Las Vegas period."
1,"Oh Treasure Island.. what have you done with yourself?\n\nAnd yes.. I REFUSE to call this TI... That is one of the most pathetic rebrands Vegas has ever seen.\n\nYou were my childhood dream. You were the place when cold Edmonton, was well.. cold.. I would escape to in my mind. Your pirate theme allowed for adults and kids alike to enjoy themselves.. you gave families a place to share being...\n\nAnd then you went and ruined it all.. every bit of it.\n\nI haven't stay at the hotel since the 90's.. but my recent visit may be my last ever inside your once friendly confines.\n\nI know you had lost your way.. it was clear as soon as the iconic sign of a skull and cross bones found it's way to the Neon Museum... but when i went searching for THE.. THE best arcade/midway that Vegas ever had.. and where I threw so much of my parents money away, it's not even funny, I was sad... nay DEVASTATED to find you had replaced the two floors of amazement, the entrance with automated skeletons to boot.. with a room? \n\nA ROOM? With a pathetic array of machines left over from the golden years? \n\nFor shame.. FOR SHAME.\n\nI gave you a second star simply for the memories.. and for the hope that one day you can do and be what you used to be."
4,Wow..... We really changed things up and ate an early dinner at the bar!  Fred is awesome... And attentive to excellent customer service!
4,"I was just there yesterday to get more paint supplies... and actually gonna go back there today! My husband and I come here so much(at least once or twice a week), so much that some of the staff already know us because we come here so often haha. We always get the greetings \""Oh you're back! weren't you just here the other day?\"" or \""How's your house projects coming along?\""  We love the paint department here compared to the other home depot on craig. The 2 staff that work at the paint department always greet us with a smile and ask how our painting is coming along. We love all the staff there, they're always helpful and friendly, which it makes it so much easier on us, and whenever you have a question, theres always someone just right around the corner! :) We always go in there with the intentions of buying 1 thing, and ONLY 1 thing, and walk out with a cart full of stuff and spend a few hundred dollars rather than 10 bucks that we had originally intended on spending. Oh well! We love working on our house and making it ours :) Tiles is our next project! I feel like we're one of their best customers lol... do we get a reward for being such great customers and spending so much money there?? I think we deserve a reward! or coupons? anything!? haha I wish... but 5 stars, hands down. Its the great customer service that keeps us coming back for more. Keep it up! :)"
2,"I've yet to try the bar at this place, so this is more a review of the restaurant part of it. I was pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant in the Hotel San Carlos and even more so to find that it was reasonably priced. Let's face it, the food is spectacular but it's completely worth eating there because of the space and the atmosphere that it conjures up. The place does evoke memories of film noir or pre-war romanticized cinema and for that I definitely give this place props. Considering that it's like pulling teeth to find anything older than fifty years in this city makes the Copper Door all the more special.\n\nLike I said, the food is decent but nothing to break an arm over. Haven't tested the bar, so that has yet to be reviewed. Go there for the experience the history that you feel pulsating throughout the walls of the ballroom."
2,"The good and the bad. Everything taste good and the portions are large. We had the trout and the bar'q chicken. The coleslaw is also excellent. \n\nBut unfortunately overpriced for the far. $23 dollars for trout..really. 17.50 for bar'q chicken and salad was extra? \n\nSo if you want to spend a little extra, you will be happy. But if you are watching your cash...see you later Charlie."
2,"Pizza was great!  Spinach salad advertised pecans - none appeared in the bowl.  Service was quite slow.  The bill needed to go back 3x because of errors...  And it wasn't because I was being picky, it was because of simple math errors!   I'll go back for the food and beer selection however because it's that good!"
1,Gotta say.. why all the boss reviews? I just moved down from Seattle.. so maybe I have had too much good Asian food up there.. but this seemed average.. The miso.. Ranch 99 instant.. I am telling u.. it was good but I don't even think it was homemade.. Tasted instant.. \n\nFood was super average and very plain. Only way to excite my taste buds was rubbing wasabi on everything.. thats not very exciting either.. I don't know.. sushi chefs seemed cool.. waitress was like a dead fish.. lol.. prior to being chopped into sushi.. no expression and so bla bla bla..  \n\nprobably not going to repeat..
4,"I've been here twice and had a brilliant time on both occasions! I would recommend a day bed! Great venue, great music, great weather, great staff! The best day party in Vegas!"
0,Too bad this place is now closed :( They had really good chai and frozen coffee drinks.... They will be missed
0,Not to happy we need a good Chinese food place out here. Maybe that's what it is. If you go you will feel like you wasted your money after you eat.  I guess it is what it is.  I hope we get some Asians out here to open up some businesses in some of these empty spaces that are all over. We need good food out here!!!!!
4,"the perfect spot for a lunch meeting - close to the city center but away from the hustle and bustle.  the quiet outside patio is nice for a breath of fresh air before returning to the recirculated air of your office tower.\n\nthe lunch menu is affordable and delicious!  i highly recommend the eggplant parm or meatball sandwiches with the house salad! (if you are dining with a friend, try ordering both and sharing half/half on the sandwiches)\n\nthe pizza and antipasto on the evening menu is top notch as well!  a great spot for casual group dinners or an intimate dinner for two. love this place!"
1,"Had the Orange chicken and garlic chicken and it's ok, I've had better.  Wouldn't go back."
2,"My mum isn't feeling well. Decided to pick her up soup. She likes the soup here and based on reviews, thought I would try.\nI did like that I was greeted immediately on arriving.  The staff are very friendly and helpful. They alone deserve 5 stars. However, the food NO. \nOrdered ours to go, as it was already 930pm. \nKids combination with a wimpy side of fruit.  (Tasted like they are from cans, not fresh) & was the size of a Chick fil a cup, 2 slender pieces of chicken strip and a kid drink 4$. \nMy Sandwich& Salad combo: Ultimate grilled cheese and nuts and berries salad. 8.30$ and there was nothing amazing or ultimate about the very plain pannini. \nWith my mums soup it was $20.46 and I can say, not nearly what I expected. ..Based on reviews.  I guess I was expecting something with flavor, for that price. I guess the disgusting soft chocolate covered strawberry is what is suppose to make up for it. If my mum wants more soup, I will of course get it for her. I just won't be eating here."
1,"We've all been there.  You've been drinking a little too much and the bar closes. You get hungry (I call them the drunchies) and you are willing to eat almost anything. You just want something really good. We made the mistake of coming to JoBot Coffee for Crepes.  We ordered the #1 (Braized Beef, Mozzarella, Swiss, Caramelized Onions, Bell Pepper, Peppercini) the #2 (Chorizo, Fried Egg, Mozzarella, Spinach, Salsa) and the B. (BANANA + NUTELLA + WHIP). The crepe wasn't hot even though it was made \""fresh\"", everything tasted bland and it was not satisfying. Decor was great, service was great and the fact they are open 24 hours on the weekend is a huge plus! However, I'd try something better for your drunchies. For some reason, all of our stomachs hurt that day right after as well. That could just be a coincidence, I suppose."
2,"THE GOOD: They serve alcohol, they're open 24/7 and have all your diner needs. The prices are an ode to old school Vegas back when awesome food specials would draw you into random hotels. Perfect for after the club \""sober me up\"" delectables.\n\nTHE BAD: The wait!!!  Oh my goodness!  You'd better have plenty of time to spare cause you'll have 3 major waits to deal with. First off its not on the strip, Second you'll wait a while to be seated and finally you'll wait a longer while to actually get your food.  I believe the long waits puts an unnecessary additional amount of pressure on the taste of the food.  We wanted Steak and Eggs and Yelped this place specifically for that reason.  Sadly the steak was REALLY tough and the hash browns were bland and uneventful. \n\nALL IN ALL: Gets the job done but not at all memorable! Again it was probably the long wait that hurt the taste so I gave this place an additional star. With all that said I'd definitely go back at some random hour with less expectations."
2,"I've had good times at Ri-Ra, and I've had some bad times.\nMost of the good times were due to the band playing, which is sometimes really good, and most of the bad times were a combination of bad music and overcrowding.\n\nThis place has been a popular mainstay of downtown/uptown as long as I can remember. \nIt's tall and long inside but very narrow, and when its crowded it can offer up a bit of a claustrophobic vibe.\n\nSince its so popular, it can draw a bit of an unruly, late-night crowd as well. Most of the people here are cool however, and the staff seem to be nice and accommodating. \n\nStill, its hard to get a beer or drink, and I usually don't spend more than an hour or two here before bailing for more comfortable confines.\n\nI can't speak to the food, as I've never eaten here. I have seen a menu though, and it looks decent, and decently priced."
4,"On behalf of the Lil Saints 12U girls softball team, I would like to thank Zzeeks for their continued support of our girls throughout this season. You have helped our team raise funds through fundraisers & it's greatly appreciated! Zzeeks will continue to be our team hang out & a true family favorite. Thanks again Zzeeks!!"
1,"When I called to make a reservation at the Teppanyaki table I was given a hard time by the hostess because two of the four people in my party wanted sushi, while the other two wanted teppanyaki. They require the majority of the party to have teppanyaki but I was not about to separate my party into two tables. I think that is just ridiculous. Our waitor also seemed pissed when I told him that I wanted a sushi menu. \n\nWe were sat with a family with three children who were very misbehaved and the parents did little to aknoledge this behavior. Our server was awkward and forgot my miso soup. However, the server assistants were great. The teppanyaki chef wasn't very animated nor was his performance interesting to watch. \n\nThe sushi was good. I tried to torro scallion roll which was extremely good. I also really liked the Kho Haku specialty roll. Although these were good, it was nothing I couldn't get at the sushi place I frequent at home."
3,I really like this restaurant... for the west island. In town it's nothing special. But thank god someone has opened a proper byow in this area. It's my official go to place when my dad wants to eat dinner now. \n\nThe pizzas are great and I've enjoyed the various pasta dishes I've tried. \n\nWord to the wise... This place is actually busy so RSVP.
0,"Absolute worst dining experience of my life. When we walked in there was only one clean table, not empty mind you, just clean. The wait for our food was astronomical. When food finally came out it was cold and the sandwiches were wrong! Who puts mayo on pastrami anyhow?? Wait staff was to busy talking on their phones to pay attention to customers. As I sit here writing this I am STILL waiting on the check and we have been done eating for a good 20 minutes. Save yourself the hassle! Don't go!"
4,"Hands down, Go see Minas if your serious about suits and formal wear. Brothers Tailors has tailored three semi-custom suits for me and I've bought about seven custom shirts from them.  They tailor and fit my jeans and slacks and even fixed a Versace necktie that had come unstitched after I snagged it.\n\nI do local and international business and everywhere I go someone complements my suit or shirt. Friendly and willing to help the staff here is great and they will work within your budget if you're on one.\n\nHighly recommend!"
1,"I utilized him, Paul, about 3 years ago for a termite problem.  I picked him based on Yelp reviews.  He did the treatment and then had to come back to retreat about 4 months after the original application.  I called him on the phone and he said he would come back but he was not going to make anything since it was under warranty.  When he came to the house again he made it very clear that this was costing him money because it was all under warranty.  I have never experienced having a business owner try to make me feel bad for asking them to honor their warranty, a warranty that I paid extra for.  I will never utilize his services again."
1,"I've been using them for 4 years because of their close proximity to my house but I've stopped.  Too many issues the last 6 months with clothes 2-3 days late, items missing, and very inconsistent customer service.  The staff turnover is very, very high."
3,"In Las Vegas for work again...But this time we looked for the cheapest strip room to stay and see how it is. Normally we have stayed at the swanky hotels, but this time we went for the $39/night Excalibur. Not because we had to, because we chose to. I did take a lot of things into consideration though when making the choice.... 1. It is only across a bridge to get to New York New York or the Luxor. 2. It has a free tram to Mandalay Bay. 3. It does have a Dick's Last Resort restaurant (which I always enjoy).\n\nWell, I must say I was pretty happy with our selection. For $20 more/night we could have upgraded to their new totally remodeled Tower II ~ but we didn't. Our room was not bad. 21st floor with two queen beds & strip views. Beds were comfortable & the shower was great. I figured we saved at least $200/night on a hotel. Plus the Excalibur has lower priced gambling tables (we didn't gamble too much). It's a quick walk to Planet Hollywood (I love Blondies for lunch there), we did actually go to Mandalay Bay (Had an awesome hamburger at the Burger Bar (@ $20/burger the 2 hamburgers cost more than our hotel room)), we did go to the Luxor & we did walk part of the strip. And, the Excalibur is only a $20 cab ride to Fremont Street. Other pluses: it had a nice pool that was not too crowded & they offer FREE Valet parking (with all our equipment, that was nice).\n\nThe two downsides I can think of: 1. Tower I is far from the pool 2. It was a much older crowd. Other than that, the hotel was not too smokey and it has a lot to offer....AND, you cannot beat the price.\n\nOther quick Vegas tid bits: 1. Fremont Street ~ GREAT as always and the cheap beer and tables more than make up for the $20 cab ride...Not to mention the GREAT people watching & the live shows & the videos. 2. Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay ~ Pricey but GOOD! 3. Blondies @ Planet Hollywood ~ ALWAYS Great!! 4. Dick's ribs & wings were awesome..."
0,"Since moving to AZ last summer, I have been on a never ending quest to find a true breakfast joint/diner. After reading reviews of Harlow's, I was excited to check it out! Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. The eggs were cooked well, but the chorizo tasted off. The hash browns were unseasoned and seemed as though they hailed from a bag of frozen mashed potatoes. The orange juice, which had been promised to be excellent, was nothing more than a hybrid between Tang and Sunny D. Needless to say, I was less than impressed.\n\nAside from the food (which is the main component at any eatery), the service was quick and friendly and the ambiance, inviting. If you're heading to Harlow's for coffee, toast and somewhere to read the paper or do homework, it's perfect."
3,"Let me start off by saying...I looooooove a good pastrami sandwich.  So when a friend suggested of mine said he was going to make a lunch run down there, I checked out their menu and right away told him to bring me back a pastrami.  I must say...I made a excellent choice.  The sandwich was very good.  Plenty of pastrami and cheese.  The pickle spear was a unexpected and pleasant surprise.   So in closing, this review is completely based on just the sandwich, I haven't been inside the shop yet...but when I do get there...I'll update."
2,"I ate here for dinner, on a personal recommendation. I'm giving it two and a half stars but will try to give it a shot during lunchtime. For those familiar with the buffet scene in Dane County, eating here made me nostalgic for Taste of Asia buffet on E. Washington that closed down several years ago. Now that was a buffet. Oysy comes close, but maybe this review isn't the space for me to dwell on other restaurants' quality. \n\nThe mussels with creamy white sauce on it was ok, so was the battered shrimp. Eggs food young was so so.  I liked the chow mein. The egg drop soup was especially yellow.  I didn't eat at the dessert aisle, by then I was just stuffed.  \n\nThe wait staff was friendly and so was the youngish looking kid behind the cashier. My fortune cookie was meaningful, so I'll take with me a good memory and the antacid."
1,"So... After being excited about the decent room rate and booking the room, I came across a number of reviews that described horrible sounding conditions of the rooms, including a bed bug and roach infestation. I told my husband we were not going to even take our stuff or kids in the room until I did a thorough inspection. After quickly reading up on how to conduct a bed bug inspection (thanks Google), I checked the room thoroughly and was happy to find no signs of bed bugs or roaches. So we stayed. \n\nWould I stay again? No. After you walk through the large hotel that doesn't seem too bad, you walk back outside to the \""courtyard\"" rooms. Sounds nice, right? Nope. It feels like you're walking out of the real hotel and walking into the motel behind it. Rooms just seem very run down, a little dirty, carpets stained, etc. The beds seemed clean, which is what led us to stay, but I didn't want the kids to even take their socks off or play on the ground at all. Its a good backup, but we personally won't do it again."
2,"I loved the molcajete! The margarita was really good as well, and it sneaks up on you.. i could barely make it to the car!"
0,Terrible service! We were overcharged thanks to the waiters inability to split a bill - each couple on a separate tab - a normal thing to do in a restaurant - NOT HERE! They tally up the whole table and divide by the number of credit cards given and charge each one the same amount regardless of what each couple ordered. Do not make the mistake of going with friends and expecting the restaurant to be able to give separate tickets seems you have to sit across the room from each other and pretend not to know each other in order for that to be possible. Food was not what it used to be. Will remove this restaurant from our list of places to go.
2,"This place was pretty good.  I came on a weekday but the wait was still pretty long.  The only gripe I had about this place was the service.  The service was really limited.  The two people that were taking our order and bringing us things seemed very VERY busy and because of that our cups were empty a couple of times.\n\nThe food was very good.  We ordered: Creamy Chicken Penne with Pesto ($19), Prosciutto ($10 Olive Oil and Garlic, Prosciutto, Fresh Mozzarella,\nArugula, Parmesan), and an appetizer Crab Cake.  Split between two people this was more than enough to eat and we actually had leftovers.  They gave us bread with the meal as well (which is to be expected).\n\nThe pasta wasn't anything amazing but it was good.  The crab cake was the best part of the whole meal which was surprising since it was an Italian restaurant but it was REEEALLY GOOD.  And the prosciutto pizza was delicious as well.  \n\nThe waiting was worth it because it made the food taste even better.  They had two people acting as hostess which was strange because our server and our waitress were both stressed out and busy.  They should hire extra help so that their staff doesn't feel stressed out or look crazy busy.  \n\nI will probably never come here again but that's just because it didn't knock-my-socks-off and there are tons of other places to try in Vegas."
1,Slowest chipotle I have ever been to. Watching people leave after standing in line so long. It's like this every time I come. Today thought if would not be bad ad there were only about 5 people ahead of me but it'd still forever.
4,"Eating here almost made me feel like i was back in the bay area! Upon walking in, i remember my co-workers exclaiming in excitement,\n\""There are other ASIANS HERE! WOH! You even pay at the register!\"" \n\nThat's authenticity roite thar.\n\nI didn't think that i would be able to find an authentic asian restaurant in the phoenix area but this place proved me wrong. Not the best pho ever, but the best by far that i found in the area."
1,"I had dinner here last night and the entire experience made me kick myself that we didn't go to the Banzo food cart!  When in doubt, just go to Banzo friends.  \n\nAfter hearing about Palmyra, our group of four were very eager to give this place a try.  We ordered four dishes, Fatoush salad, falafel salad, chicken schwarma and potato curry.  The food arrived very late, the food was cold and just not that great.  The pita was really cold.  Ick.  My friend was accosted as he walked into the bathroom by an employee and after he already confirmed he was a customer, he was asked to prove his table number if he wanted to use the bathroom.  I totally get you might get wanderers in from State St. to use the bathroom but pay attention and don't get them confused with customers!  \n\nNope, not coming back."
4,"I was very happy this time when I went to Hana.  They have the wild salmon back, which is SO amazing!\nThe place is small and fills up fast on any given night.  I love that you can bring your own beer wine and saki."
2,Quick review:\n\nWe ate at the sushi place inside and it was delicious! My boyfriend loves it here just because they offer crapless craps... I can safely say that we will probably stop by on our next trip.
2,"I'm only giving it a three because of consistency... When visiting Charlotte and this restaurant, my food and drink were awesome!! I had the queen city chicken.  I took a taste of two other entrees. My sister's cheese steak was literally burnt and dry. My moms steak sandwich (can't remember the name but it came with the au jus) was perfect!! They went again without me and said that everything was ok (this was a lunch visit).  So in my opinion give it a try.  Maybe just skip the cheese steak sandwhich."
1,"The first time I ate at Nourish I was unimpressed. I wanted to like it so much that I went back, but I left feeling the same way. I have food allergies and believe that healthy, vegan, gluten free food can and should taste good. Aside from the sweet potato and avocado salad everything my husband or I tried was very bland and unsatisfying. I left wanting more.."
4,"La Belle Terre was a show stopper! I met up with an old friend here about a month ago and it was the perfect place for catch up. \n\nWe got ourselves seated by the cashier, impressed by the caf\u00e9's authenticity. Ooh la la. Having learnt about the French culture throughout high school, I have to admit that it felt like I was transported all the way to France. The staff even had an accent to go with the great smelling pastries!\n\nI decided to order a florentine croque monsieur. It was dense and savory, definitely belying its size. Don't be so quick to judge how small it is. Le croque monsieur - which came with a plate of sliced baguette and butter - were very filling. I didn't even have room to order a drink to go with em'! \n\nThis gem is the creme de la creme of Vegas caf\u00e9s. Find it on the corner of sahara and Durango where Paymons patio dining can be found. C'etait fantastique!"
4,"My mother and I came here for Christmas Eve and we were SO PLEASED with the ensemble-style waitstaff. I had the surf and turf and she had the dual lobster tails. Perfectly prepared seafood, very light and buttery--but filling! Amazing ambiance, great food presentation. We came for the view, fell in love with the food. Had no room for dessert! We thought the photographer was a little aggressive, but she took some great photos."
1,"Went to this place a couple years back with family during a trip to Vegas and loved it! Ordered all-you-can eat. My dad even got sick for over-eating! We couldn't wait to visit again this time.\n\nWe ordered alligator tail as appetizers this time and they were yummy. However, the all you can eat platters we normally order was good only towards the END. It seemed as if the oil used to fry our fish and shrimp initially was old...yuck! I don't even want to know how old. At the end of our meal (as they brought our new batches) it seemed to taste better. I like to enjoy my food in the beginning. I inquired with our waitress about the oil used and she confirmed that she did see one of the chefs change the oil to fresh oil at the end. Whack! The salad bar was pretty sad too and didn't look like anyone maintained cleanliness. Might be helpful to put the same items on both sides - makes it easy to maneuver and avoid spills. I did like how they kept plates chilled for it though. \n\nOur service was good and our waitress did her job. Sadly, we've lost our craving for this place. It just isn't the same.\n\nNote: Despite what time your stomach says let's eat, this place opens at 5 p.m. - we went at 3 with ready bellies the day before and had sour faces :("
1,"I am sitting at the bar as I type this. I have never posted anything on Yelp before until now. That is how ridiculous what just happened is IMHO. I ordered a glass of Glenmorangie neat. The menu says 11.  The bartender says \""That it will be 14.\"" I point out that the menu says 11. She then informs me that they \""up charge\"" for neat. I am confused and the look on my face shows it. I say, \""You charge for no ice?\"". To which she says, neat means more alcohol. I'm dumbfounded and we go back and fourth about the meaning of neat and she insist that's what bars do. That is not what \""bars\"" do. That is what this place does.  I have had Scotch neat in a hundreds of bars and restaurants (dives to very fine dining) across the country and never once has anyone charged me above menu price because I don't want water down liquid gold. Big time disappointment.  \n\nAfter paying, I looked at the menu a second time and it does mention it at the bottom under \""Up Grades\"".  There are several so called up grade items that were unfamiliar to me and nondescript.  The one she hit me with was listed as \""Rocks/Neat +2\"", which implies both are a 2 dollar charge.  With there already being a large mark up on alcohol, is it necessary to add 2 dollars for not wanting ice?  It is if your \""on the rocks\"" pours are so small, that pouring a drink neat would show how much you are ripping people off.  I would rather you establish a consistent pour and charge me the same rate than flim flam me."
4,Two words! Tina Mateo. She makes this place fun to hang out at anytime! The Food and Gaming Specials are great too. Limited graveyard menu as well.
3,"Some long-time friends brought us here for brunch after having raved about it for months, so we certainly had high expectations, and they were definitely met.\n\nAside from the fact that you have to walk into the Paris to get there, the restaurant is delightfully French-y and the service is excellent. The restaurant was super busy that Saturday brunch, but our waitress was on top of everything and very friendly.\n\nI had a wonderful quiche Lorraine, which was the whole quiche (!) and clearly cooked to order, which was a nice surprise. A tablemate had a burger, which he said was fantastic, and the wine list was shockingly reasonably priced.\n\nThe only downside was the overall price of the menu. I get that it's Las Vegas and it's on the Strip, but we had just come Le Diplomate in Washington, DC, which we also think is pricey, and even that seemed comparatively tame in comparison with LV's Strip prices. But hey, it's still cheaper than the flight to France!"
3,"Conveniently located right off  of the lobby/check in area of the Augustus and Octavius towers.  Staff service great, very pleasant, and knowledgeable of the product - they knew that some Starbucks had started to replace Tazo tea with Tevana.  they accept Starbucks cards but they dont have a reader so it takes a little longer as they have to manually enter the card number.  that said, my transaction was handled pretty quickly and the person at the register did not grumble while entering the card number - very pleasant experience.  Nice bench to sit on, but no tables/ chairs as its a smaller corner spot.  Standard food items available."
3,"This review received four stars on account of my visit not being an otherwordly experience. If there was a massage thrown in, that would have been amazing. I digress, however.\n\nI stayed safe and stuck with chicken: the chicken teriyaki/chicken katsu bento was very nicely proportioned. There wasn't too much of either item. All of their bentos come with steamed rice and a basic salad, of which the dressing was rather tasty; possibly a combination of ranch and sesame oil. You may ask for steamed brown rice instead. That's an extra $2.00 charge. As I was hungry, I ate everything in my box.\n\nTheir katsu sauce was definitely an improvement over the fair I get at L&L and Hawaiian A-Go-Go off of East Charleston and Sloan.\n\nI recommend this place if you want to escape the oily fried foods you would experience elsewhere around UNLV. I will be back again to try something else. See you then!"
0,They the one mess up my order but she is like it my faul. after she need to make new one she said I have to make sure my order and she give me bad attitude.
3,"Great food, friendly staff.  What stood out to me is when a dining partner spilled his beverage when they were bringing the food, he knocked my food onto my lap.  They promptly brought another plate without us having to ask.  \n\nInexpensive, but tasty.  Try the chorizo tacos.  Their tortillas are really good.  It's not a fancy dining experience - food comes in plastic baskets and a piece of wax paper - but it's a great value."
4,"This place has a female mechanic. We definitely need more women in the automotive industry!\n\nI requested for them to check my clutch too, even though they are not a full service autoshop. Fortunately, my clutch is working fine. I was having problems during the summer and winter, when it's hot the clutch slips too much, and when its cold during the winter it gets VERY grippy. \n\nAnyways, they proved to me that my car is fine. Just some design flaw I guess, since my car has a hydraulic self-adjusting clutch pedal. \n\nDid you know it only took like five minutes of conversing with Adriana (the female mechanic) before they returned my car with the oil, filter, and airbox filter all completely changed?!? \n\nIt may be more expensive than the usual stay at the Toyota Dealership, but appointments at the dealership took me in excess of 2 hours, possibly THREE just to get a oil change. Even though Toyota provides me a 21-point inspection, it basically is the same exact thing with JiffyLube."
2,"I LOVE MEXICANS.... I MEAN MEXICAN FOOD!\n\nPepe's compared to Roberto's. \n\nPepe's knocks this one out of the ball park. The reason being the quality of food is way better. I want it to be known that the staff here is very friendly, maybe a little to friendly I had a guy in the back winking at me.\nAlso the first time I was here one of the employees actually asked me for my number, at that time (2010) I was single and to this day I still talk to him as a good friend.\n\nOverall you can order anything with the carne asada and it will be great. The carne asada is finely chopped and has very minimal fat. They season their meat very well, not to salty nor to bland. The add a side of beans and tortilla chips.\n\nThe only thing I would do different is keep the salsa station clean."
2,"The food was pretty good. The service was not so good.\n\nSit outside for sure, if you are there when its warm enough. It is a great view of the Bellagio fountain show that goes every 15 minutes at night.\n\nWe had a reservation around 8pm. We decided that we wanted to sit outside, so we put our names in and were told to come back in about an hour. (It was about 90 degrees outside, in the middle of August, but it was bearable.)\n\nSuper slow service.\n\nThey give you an iPad to view the drink menu, and it was super tricky to navigate. It's kind of a cool idea, but wasn't working well.\n\nFun experience but won't be going back."
0,"So so so bad. I planned a night with my husband at Camelback Sahara/Hotel 502 because I got such a steal on Hotels.com. We looked forward to it and the pictures looked decent. But it is so bad! From the minute we pulled into the parking lot we considered just driving back home! (We left the baby at Grandmas hoping for a fun night on the town).\n\nThe location is good - central and a few blocks from Central rail station - but it is a Days Inn. It has Days Inn TV's, Days Inn room numbers, Days Inn carpet, Days Inn water pressure (none). It is literally an old Days Inn that they are trying to turn into a hip resort (slowly... and cheaply).  They had two nice employees (three, if you count the friendly guard dog who lives upstairs), and the pool was DECENT. But there were black hairs on our bathroom floor, USED/empty shampoo and lotion bottles, and I wanted to shower from just sitting on the bed. DONT DO IT! Gross and scary!"
4,"I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips.\nI am just in love with it.\n\nEverytime I go to the US, I have to go there.\nCheap, super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have (as I cannot eat wheat flour).\nThe meat is always tasty and fresh and again .....their guacamole ....the best !!!!\n\nAlways clean and fresh with friendly staff.\n\nHealthy fast food .....\n\nJust wish that we had it in Canada !!"
4,"Renegade always has consistently great food. It's also very nice inside with an open atmosphere and classy decor. I love everything on their menu, and I usually get their salmon. And... best of all.... the BREAD PUDDING. So nom. My parents really like the creme brulee too. Great spot with great food!"
1,"Meh .\nDa Emma has now officially joined the ranks of \""just any other Italian restaurant\"" in Montreal.\n\nThis used to be my favourite Italian restaurant in Montreal. I would make it a must stop for everything from birthdays to wedding anniversaries, to graduation fetes. I'm not quite sure what happened here. :(\nBetween getting cold (yes, COLD) pasta sides to getting a different side from the one that I had ordered, albeit without even having been told. All the way to not even getting acknowledged half the night by our server (I had to flag him down most of the time. Really?! When many main dishes are over $40, why am I running after servers?) To getting bottled water when it was never even requested. I had even asked to get another table in the restaurant (as it was pretty much half empty) and the table I asked for didn't even have a \""reservation\"" sign on it. No big deal, right? Wrong. I was awkwardly told \""Sorry, we save that other two-spot table in case we have to push two sets together for a party of four\"". Okay, that's fine.\nKnow what happened? \nThey pushed the tables together alright - for another couple. They had their nice big spot and we stayed put. What happened to saving it for a party of four? Am I missing something here?... \nWhat a disappointment. Cold food is never okay. Off nights happen, but it won't change that I'm likely not going to go back. Having been to many top restaurants in New York City like Babbo, Del Posto and Scarpetta, I'd say Da Emma should re evaluate their service. Times are tough, people! If you want to keep charging your exorbitant prices you better make it worth the customers' time and money. What a shame."
4,"I have to say that I had no complaints with my stay here at the Rio. When my boyfriend and I checked in, the front desk agent was very knowledgeable and friendly. Went to our suite and it was awesome! Very clean and spacious! The casino was a little small compared to other hotels, but it had a bit of everything. The dealers here were friendly and personable. I have to say that I was most comfortable and enjoyed playing tables and slots at the Rio. \n\nThe Rio is about a mile off the strip, but the walk to the strip isn't too bad. Well we did go when the weather wasn't too hot. It would be killer during the summer. There are free shuttles that will take you to the strip too.\n\nThe fitness gym is a little small, but everything that you need is in there. The spa and fitness employees were very helpful and kind. The gym was always neat and water and juice were always refilled.\n\nIf I were to go back to Las Vegas, I would definitely stay at the Rio. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay!!"
4,"The lamb gyros were excellent and the side of soup was delicious. The prices were reasonable. The employees were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. Finally, a good Greek restaurant that's not too far from the house."
2,"Das Vogel ist Pflicht am Wochenende  wegen dem ausgezeichneten Bier, wegen der geselligen Atmosph\u00e4re, wegen der Fu\u00dfball-\u00dcbertragungen, wenn man's mag, und dem Biergarten.\nWenn dann sp\u00e4testens das zwote Bier den Appetit anregt, stiert man mit steigendem Interesse auf die kredenzten Speisen in Form recht gro\u00df beladener Teller. Davon verlockt, haben wir hier schon das ein oder andere auf der Karte probiert. Sagen wir mal so: Enthusiasmus war dabei kein treuer Begleiter; mit den mediterranen Panini sind wir meist einigerma\u00dfen gut gefahren. Der Wurstsalat mit Pommes von neulich allerdings, der schlug dem beim Vogel zuweilen erh\u00e4ltlichen Geheimbier-Fass den Boden aus, denn es wurde gereicht: Der sch\u00e4bigste Wurstsalat diesseits der Rheinauen! Geschmacklich mindestens fragw\u00fcrdig, weil billigste Fleischwurststummel, in Liaison mit einer nicht vorhandenden Marinade (bissle Essig und \u00d6l h\u00e4tts doch schon getan) an  last but not least  penetrant schmeckenden Zwiebelringen. Die Pommes: Mit viel Wohlwollen als lauwarm zu bezeichnen, dazu lasch, also so, als h\u00e4tte man die Reste vom Nachbarteller in der K\u00fccher schnell nochmal zusammengeschustert und in der Mikrowelle warmgemacht. Alles lieblos Lieblos und f\u00fcr diese Qualit\u00e4t viel zu teuer. Fazit: Bier absolute Spitzenklasse: 5 Punkte, Atmosph\u00e4re gut: 4 Punkte. Essen: 1-2 Punkte.\nLetzteres genie\u00dfe ich in Zukunft woanders.\nAch so: Die Toiletten (in meinem Fall die der Herren) verdienen auch einen Abschlusskommentar: Beengt, sehr unangenehm riechend, bedingt sauber. Fazit dortens: Durchhalten bis zu Hause. Prost!\nErg\u00e4nzung:\n\nDie Panini von neulich, die waren auch schon deutlich besser. Nach langer Wartezeit die falschen gebracht, erfolgreich reklamiert (Bedienung war sehr freundlich), die dann tats\u00e4chlich bestellten und gelieferten Kreta-Panini waren allerdings \u00e4u\u00dferst \u00fcberschaubar belegt.  Also, auch wenn sehr viel Betrieb war, irgendwie muss Euer Koch gewechselt haben oder die Rezeptur oder watwei\u00dfich.  Ich beschr\u00e4nke mich in Zukunft ausschlie\u00dflich aufs Bier, das ist nach wie vor Spitze. Hoffe, DAS bleibt so!"

1,"I bought a groupon for a 60 minute massage. I unfortunately did not read the reviews below before I made the purchase. In retrospect, the previous reviews are 100% accurate. My experience was pretty much the same. \n\nAlthough my massage wasn't completely terrible, I wish I had gone elsewhere. Yes, the massaeuse was older and it seemed difficult for her to perform a deep tissue massage. Her hands and arms were shaking from applying pressure. She was chewing gum audibly. The music selection was not relaxing by any means. Was that christian rock? Not too mention it wasn't a full hour long. \n\nWhen I walked in, the receptionist had a mouth full of food. She was awkward. The entire office was pretty crappy. There was a make-shift dog play area. When I declined to purchase another massage afterwards, she seemed genuinely disappointed in my answer. Upset even. It was weird. \n\nI hate to give such a poor score, but really... some changes need to be made."
1,went on a sunday afternoon. only one lady working. she wasn't the friendliest of people. nor was the place very clean ...or at least it didn't look very clean to me. it was $10 for eyebrows and $5 extra for lip. (yes i got that mo going once in a while). \ncost--- not used to paying that much. back in so cal (spoiled little india) threading for brow and lips only $11. \nservice-- was quick however didn't get that ointment to soothe the sting from the threading. my eyebrows are nice but my male friends eyebrows come out a bit to fem.... im guessing she doesn't get many male clients. \ni dont think i'll be going back.... time too look again for a brow place. had hopes for this one.
2,"It looks like a lot of people are split on Tom's.  Now lets get the obvious out of the way.  It is the Southside people, plus this is a late night diner, plus this is the SOUTHSIDE.  The diner is not in the greatest of conditions but the booths are big enough to seat a group of 6 which is great at 2am.  Be nice and your food will come out faster, at like a hooligan and you will probably be waiting a little longer.  But in general the food normally comes out pretty fast\n\nNow, to the food.  A couple things.  Stick to the breakfast, because it is good and nothing beats a good breakfast spot after a night at the bars.  The pancakes and breakfast sandwiches are my favorite.  \n\nSecond, I really thing they have a good late night gyro.  Don't ask why out of all the places in the Southside that I choose Tom's to get a Gyro, but they have an XTRA Large Gyro.  The moment I saw that on the menu, I just could not resist.  The end of result: I was good because it was a very large gyro, but the quality of meat was not of Mike and Tony's.  But I did not expect it to be great because it was so large and that was enough to satiate me at the time.  \n\nOverall, Tom's is your spot for a some good food and a place to go over the bad decisions you may have made earlier in the night."
3,"Boba (aka Bubble Tea (aka Tapioca)) is fantastic here.\n\nBack in California, we have a boba chain called Tea Station and Ten Ren's.  Theirs is the best I've ever tasted and Rose Tea Cafe is comparable.  \n\nTheir Green Milk Tea (or jasmine milk tea in other places) was the perfect hint of tea.  The consistency was not too thin or thick.  Their actual tapioca balls... I don't recall whether they were exceptional but they weren't bad.  \n\nThe food is pretty good and comes in healthy portions.\n\nNow, the BAD...  the wait is absolutely ridiculous.  If you come around dinnertime- 6p or 7p, you really have to wait an hour for two people.  It's also a very narrow room so the waitresses are constantly tripping around people waiting by the door.\n\nI just advise that you come around 8 or 9p or a lot earlier in the day."
3,"Both my wife and I ordered burgers. I had the pesto burger as seen on triple d and she had the cheeseburger with saut\u00e9ed onions. I had the onion rings and she had the garlic fries. To be honest I expected more from the burger that was featured, it was ok, I was not blown away by it. However, the onion rings and fries were the bomb! My wife enjoyed her burger as well. Will return for sure."
3,Great service.  Good food. Great naan.
1,"Salut Yelp! ca va? moi? Je suis bien!\n\nWhat can I say about Amelie? other than it's a really creepy French movie, however this is a 24 hour bakery!! 20 FREAKING 4 HOURS! \n\nI was so hyped to go here! My second night in Charlotte I had to go. I went around 11 at night, and it was pretty busy! There was a lot in the case I would have thought they would be empty. NOPE!\nThe interior of the bakery was kinda over the top. with RB and hip hop music. I was expecting French tones. Oh well that's not the issue here\n\nThe pricing as okay... not a fan of the pricing on the little bits. almost 2 bucks for a small that can be eaten in one chew. NO thank you! \n\nThe tarts however were yummy, about 4 bucks or so which is what I would expect, in KC it would have been 5 or 6 dollars. \n\nMy biggest issue, the french macaroons. The cookie was made correctly, however the filling was not. It was like they just got jelly from the store and spread it on. And the creme... was it creme?! Idk, but it was horrible! \n\nIf you all every had French macaroons you know the filling is what makes the cookie. and I wasted about 12ish dollars on 5 macaroons in which I only ate1/2 of one. My gf ate 1 and we just left the rest in the hotel trash\n\nWould I come back? probably they also have a real food menu too. I've give it a try again but won't be buying the french macaroons."
3,"definitely returning when i go back to vegas.\n\nthe sushi was really good. very fresh and as alot of people mentioned earlier, some were very creative. \n\nthe main reason we tried this spot was that it was conveniently located 1 min away from the house lol. we were pleasantly surprised to find out that it was really good as well.\n\nwe had the \""i did your ex wife\"" = a bunch of stuff in a jalapeno and deep fried. this was by far my favorite dish this time. i just wish they had a bigger portion.\n\nthe gf had the japanese pizza. it took forever and a day and wasnt really that great but still worth a try.\n\noverall this place was a little pricey but worth it when you need that sushi fix."
2,"I chose this place based on its 4.5 star rating and assumed it had to be the best choice in town. Once again, this strategy has left me feeling duped and disappointed. \n\nYou can smell the smokey BBQ outside. But that smell somehow did not transfer into our food. \n\n1. Service was impersonal. Asked for straws twice. No refills offered. Server said goodbye and thank you after walking away from the table with her back to us 10 feet away. \n\n2. Food was nothing special. Pulled brisket and chicken sandwiches were  bland, and luke warm. Ketchup and BBQ sauces seemed like cheap generic brands. Coleslaw was too thickly cut and what's with the honey mustard dressing? Never had coleslaw like that. \n\n3. $7.50 for a plain average 4 ounce sandwich, and you charge extra for coleslaw which would normally come on a sandwich like this anyway? \n\nWill not return. Might just pack a picnic lunch for our next adventure to Wickenburg."
4,"I come here once a week. Food is always good. Usually I have Miso Ramen or the lunch special Tina Tataki. I think the Tataki is best in town, if there is anywhere else with a betyer tataki I have not had it.\n\nService can be an issue so come when it's not busy. Also thwir late nite option is great!"
3,very affordable and delicious filet mignon for only $32. will come back again!
0,"Stopped here for a quick bite with friends before a conference.  The drinks came right away.  After waiting over 45 minutes for our food, we finally received one order:  allegedly \""chili nachos,\"" it was a plate of dry tortilla chips accompanied by a cup of cold chili and a cup of ice-cold, congealed nacho cheese.  When we asked where our other four orders were, the server was very defensive - \""sorry about the wait, but a bunch of other people just left and cancelled their orders, so we had to deal with that.\""  (Wow, can't imagine why that happened!)  At that point, we decided that we needed to leave without the food, because our conference sessions were about to begin.  To his credit, the bartender said he wouldn't charge us for the drinks.  We tipped him and left.  I've had decent - if not stellar - experiences at the location in Tucson, but I'm certainly never visiting this location again (and I'll probably think twice before patronizing the Tucson location, too.  There are too many places with good food and service to waste time on a place like this.)\n\nI almost forgot to mention that the booth was comically decrepit - giant holes in the seat and a spring poking out from under the seat, occasionally scraping my leg if I wasn't careful.  And...for the coup de grace, when we exited the booth, the seat completely collapsed.  It was actually sort of hilarious."
4,"We hosted our wedding (ceremony and reception) at the Auberge St.Gabriel last weekend and it couldn't have been more perfect. They are closed for regular service on Sunday and Monday but had no problem accommodating our party of about 85 people for a ceremony downstairs and the reception on their 3rd floor.\nThe food they served was amazing, the staff stood on their heads to make sure everyone was taken care of in every way. We brought a band that easily plugged in to the house system and sounded great. We had Groupe Carte Blanche do a bit of decorating for us (they are true professions as well) but the venue is so unique it doesn't take much.\n\nThank you all for making our wedding perfect. We will be back for lunch as soon as we can!"
0,I used to love the veggie sandwiches here until I found out what I was supporting by eating here. Jimmy John is one of those people that use their money for evil. He pays a lot of the money that comes from this chain to go to Africa and shoot exotic animals. Beautiful elephants and cheetahs. Google it if you need to see for yourselves. Sandwiches are not that damn good. I'm disgusted. Boycott JJ.
2,"Coming from Philadelphia I have a few things to say about good Italian food.  \nThis place is good, but not great, and the price compared to the portion size is not good.  The bread they give you before the meal is very nice and tasty.  The atmosphere is a bit ostentatious;  I going to  guess the clientele have money and they don't treat the wait staff very well, so the wait staff intern are not very friendly.  This is common in these neighborhood higher end restaurants, sad but true.  I can get better Italian for cheaper with a more laid back atmosphere else ware in the valley, but this is a hard combination to find in this area of the county."
4,"Great atmosphere, friendly welcoming service and most important the food it is delicious!!! I highly recommend it, specially if you are like me, from out of town. Great experience!!!"
3,"Service and food are excellent! No fluff, just straight up, great quality. Every plate that was being served looked and smelled great. \nI will most definitely be returning to sample the rest of the menu!"
3,"Beautiful Shannon M's last gift to me before she left.  The gift of another pizzeria to enjoy in her absence.\n\nI liked the floor plan with the inside/outside bar.  Clearly I am behind in my reviews because I have not seen outside in several months.  We shared two pizzas and a fried calzone (the Vesuvio) among 3 of us.  It was all pretty great.  I did have to ask what a few of the ingredients were, but the server was more than willing to educate me with enthusiasm.  There's also a small grocer on one side where you can pick up a quick lunch or ingredients to use at home.\n\nDefinitely worth a return visit!"
2,"honestly, I don't think there is anything THaT great about this place. Worlds best waffles? I've made waffles just as good with a waffle maker in a college cafeteria ... they don't do anything special with these waffles either-the only option is to order one plain with a side of bacon.... I've ordered breakfast dishes here before and I'm pretty sure they make it taste good by using a lot of butter and salt. There is nothing else unique about how they cook the food... It is very run of the mill. If you are a fan of bacon, it's pretty damn good. The orange juice is Freshly squeezed and SO delicious, and for that I'll give this place 3 stars..."
0,"So.... I'm still befuddled about what just happened to me at Frenchie's just now. I stopped in to get a quick eyebrow waxing, because I had a short break from work. I walk in, there's no one waiting. Two people are getting manicures, one person is getting a pedicure. The nail tech asks how she can help me. I say \""I'd like to get an eyebrow waxing\"". She says, \""Can you come back tomorrow?\""\n\nA beat passes because my brain has to register what she just said. TOMORROW?? It is 3:00 in the afternoon. They close at 7pm. \""Tomorrow???\"" I say, thinking\"" not come back in an hour or two, but tomorrow?!!\"" You don't have someone who can wax my eyebrows within the next FOUR hours? Tomorrow??\n\n\""Yes, the guy who does it is busy now,\"" she replies. \""Can you come back tomorrow?\""\n\nI shake my head in puzzlement... No... thanks anyway. \n\nThe refrain of Tomorrow still buzzing in my head.... I'll find somewhere else."
2,"Why am I surprised that The Rustic hasn't been reviewed yet? A solid three stars, smack dab in the middle. It's a dive bar on Park St., in a part of town that most of my friends tend to avoid. I casually mentioned one day that I had gone to The Rustic the night before, and was met with wide eyes and admonishment. What? It's harmless. They've got PBR tall boys (or silos, if you will.) They have a long, wooden bar, wobbly pub tables and stools, and bags of Cheetos if you get hungry. We were there for an \""after-party\"" of sorts, where my friend's drunken roommate was somehow doing a \""working interview\"" bartending. Hilarity!"

1,"Since I was coming over to Glendale, AZ for Baseball Spring Training, I had to book a hotel for three days. I didn't really care where I was going to stay. So, I used Priceline's Bid System and with the low price I submitted, I was going to stay at the Crossland Economy Studios. \n\nI wasn't going to use the hotel that much since I was going to see the Los Angeles Dodgers at Camelback Ranch. So, this place was perfect to just sleep and go. Prices will vary when you stay here. I forgot to take a photo of this place, but its on McDowell and 51st Ave. It is a three floor hotel or an apartment. Why I said that?! Well, it seems like it was made as an apartment versus a hotel. The elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor. \n\nThe room is simple with a small electric stove, sink, and microwave. I didn't have tub, just a shower with a seat. For some reason, my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place. Not sure what that was about. Someone didn't clean the place thoroughly. Also, I noticed that every time I left the room and come back many hours later, I noticed the bathroom was a little wet, but major. So, there are some plumbing issues here. TV is very standard and room has an AC...COVERED WITH STRAWBERRY-COLOR'd type jelly. I swear it was all over the room.\n\nThere plenty of fast food places you can eat at that are just walking distance from the hotel: Sonics, McDonalds, and etc. If you are collecting trash, please note that housekeeping does charge. There are trash bins near the stairwells to dump the trash. \n\nOffice Hours are from 630am to 10pm. I had to leave a bit early, but there is a phone just outside the office to call the front desk. There isn't much to complain since I had already known that it was going to happen. If you don't plan to use your room often and save $$$$, then this is a place to stay. \n\nYelp is my Review, My Story, and My Life. It's time to share it."
1,"For some reason, the pump wouldn't take my Visa card. It beckoned me to, \""please see cashier.\"" Fortunately, I had hours to spare and was delighted to spend my afternoon with the Shellmart cashier, which is precisely why I pulled into a station with automatic electronic pumps. Alas,  the pump subsequently decided to accept a MasterCard, which prevented me from journeying inside to sample Shell's stale generic-brand Twinkies."
3,"Overall, good food, noble mission... It's a place that you feel good about eating a meal at :) \n\nI absolutely love the concept behind King's Kitchen. They are a not-for-profit restaurant that donates 100% of it's profits from sales to feed the community. Not only do they have a noble mission and vision, but they have tasty food! \n\nI had a group interview in Uptown and a few of us were looking for a lunch spot close by. It was the one rainy, cold, windy day that week and we were on foot. Someone suggested Jimmy John's but I refused to walk too far.  Luckily, The King's Kitchen was at the corner of the block. We walked in and we took a peak at the menu. Everyone was satisfied with the selection so we asked to be seated. I got the chicken salad croissant sandwich which came with a side. I opted for a mixed greens salad with balsamic. The sandwich was excellent! The side salad was good, a simple mixed green salad with fresh ingredients. No complaints. The other selections at the table looked tasty as well! The prices were fair, $9-13 for the lunch menu.  The service was attentive and everyone was very polite. I would like to return to try their dinner selections."

3,"Items Selected:\nChocolate Chip Buttermilk Short Stack\nChallah French Toast\nBaked Apple Pancake\n\nTechnically a chain, with origins in Portland OR and the famous Walker Bros location in Wilmette IL, it was only when Groupon offered a discount that I realized Las Vegas even had an Original Pancake House and although I guess it could be said that the $8 discount was the impetus for my visit, in reality it was fond childhood memories that drew me through the doors.  Located on Fort Apache, and thus less than ten minutes from my door, it was after another long morning run that I arrived at the sizeable storefront and although the clock had just ticked past 7:15am I entered the restaurant to find the place already lively, a quartet of tables already seated while two couples before me checked in with a friendly hostess soon leading them to their seats.  Eventually finding my place at a booth best suited for four it was mere seconds before my server stopped by and with my order pre-decided based on past experience a simple request that plates arrive in two courses was granted, the long cooking time of the later assuring a fifteen minute delay between rounds.  Sipping on water as the restaurant continued to fill it would not be long before first plates arrived and although the restaurant's eponymous buttermilk batter was fluffy as ever beneath a mountain of whipped cream it was the house-baked challah that truly impressed, the exterior rendered crispy while the center was soaked in sweet custard playing counterpoint the rich egginess of soft bread.  Admittedly a substantial start, and nearly enough to use up my gift certificate, there was simply no way I was leaving Original Pancake House without ordering one of their signatures and this time opting for the Baked Apple Pancake over the Dutch Baby I'll simply say that one cannot go wrong with either, the piping hot pile of thinly sliced Granny Smith's teaming with cinnamon and sugar atop a buttery golden base proving as much a 'pie' as it does a pancake, but absolutely delicious regardless of what it is called.\n\nIndividually owned and operated but similar in menu from coast-to-coast there is simply 'something' about Original Pancake House that makes me smile - the service ever pleasant, the space always bustling, and the apple pancake always served so hot that you *know* the first bite is likely to end in a blistered mouth.  Obviously a bit more expensive than IHOP or Denny's but also using superior ingredients including 93-score butter, pure whipping cream, and free-range eggs it's good to know that every once in a while you can indeed find a taste of 'home,' even a thousand or more miles away."
1,"Decent beers on tap, great service, and mediocre everything else. Both burgers we tried had improper proportions of cheese to meat, very little toppings of interest, and there was nothing special about the meat-- you could barely taste it. It has to be a darn good burger to charge $12 with no sides, and that, it wasn't.\n\nThe website and online menu leads you to believe it's a much hipper, younger place but the atmosphere was lacking. It felt like a stuffy, dark place that older people would feel comfortable in, and it was mostly older people eating there.\n\nThere were two servers for the entire restaurant, one of which was also the host and bartender. They were super friendly, composed, and helpful. The water was room temperature which is a little untraditional for American dining. The music was awful... drab and slow.\n\nNothing we tried we would order again, and we're definitely not going back. Bummer!"
3,"We two families ate there last week. The sushi was unique and, for the most part, outstanding. The seasoned edamame was quite good with the exception of the southwest sauce (too sloppy), but the southwest dry seasoning was great. As for the sushi, we all loved tuna tartar appetizer.  It was like nachos for sushi lovers!  How cool. The good to great rolls included the big daddy, spicy tuna, and banzai (which included jalepeno). I felt that the tootsie roll was too heavy with eel sauce but it was still enjoyed by all. For that matter, I believe that their eel sauce is too thick whenever applied.  It made things oversweet.   The miso soup was good but also a tad heavy.  Finally, the service was flawless. \n\nWe will be back!  Yum."
2,"I knew Five Guys back when there was only one in the DC area, so the chain concept really doesn't work for me.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but just not as good as Five Guys used to be.  So glad to have them downtown at Cityscape though and hope they do really well!"
4,I love this Port of Subs! The staff is very friendly and make me feel at home. Everything is very neat and clean and I always get what i want. I have been going here for several years now and the staff changes pretty often but everyone is always nice. I would recommend this place over any other locations.
4,"Yum, yum, yum!\n\nWill try not to repeat other diners reviews so here goes:\n\nLoved the burgers. Juicy, well cooked and good quality, home made burgers.\n\nLoved the chips. Partly skin on, yummy, perfectly cooked, crispy where it counts and fluffy inside.\n\nFab gluten free buns (burger gf) - looks like brioche buns but held together really well and really impressed they do gf buns too!\n\nGreat ice cream - maple syrup and walnut home made on the premises. \u00a31,75 for a decent sized scoop in a tub with toppings at 50p each. Yummy as were the toppings: honeycomb and I also asked for peanut butter. Proper US peanut butter. \n\nToilets - lovely and clean. Always a good point.\n\nSo, burger, chips, coke, ice cream and toppings, about \u00a312.50. Went home in food coma and raved about the gf greatness of the burgers. Staff friendly and left us to chat. Love the environmental commitment with Vegware packaging being used. Can't wait to go back!"
4,"So I want to tell you my story of getting my best buddy here at this location. And then I can do a proper review. \n\nI was looking for a cat as a friend and also as someone to help me through my depression. Animals are found to be great sources of help through everything, and I wanted to give a cat a forever home. So I looked on the website for a few days until I came upon a handsome Lynx Point Siamese. The second I saw him, I had a good feeling about him. So I went straight here. \n\nAt first I didn't see him anywhere and had to ask if he had already been adopted. They had him in quarantine to make sure he wasn't sick or anything, but I still got to meet him! Whew! What a releif. So it took a few extra minutes to get him, but I waited in one of the rooms. They brought him in a small blue crate. When they opened up the crate I sat on the floor to be more inviting to him. He looked around for a little bit and then came right up to me and let me pet him. He started walking on me and was really comfortable already. He really loved my attention and how I was talking with him. I had found my buddy I had been looking for. So I adopted him right on the spot! \n\nOn the way home, he escaped from the temporary box they put him in and came and sat on my lap the rest of the drive home. Normally I wouldn't let an animal do that for their safety, but he seemed so happy and content, I just couldn't move him until I got home. \n\nThat was just a little over a year ago. Now he's fully grown and is still my bestest kitty. I look forward coming home to him every day and hanging out with him. He really means the world to me. \n\nSo now that I got that out of the way, the Humane Society was wonderful when I went! I now make monthly donations to them. It's not a lot but the least I could do to help for all they did for me. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Everything is very clean, and everyone really does seem to care about the animals and who they go to. I really hope to volunteer sometime in the near future for them to help out even more. I would love to help out with the other cats. If I could, I would take them all home with me! \n\nThank you AZ Humane Society!"
2,"We reserved online our rooms online at vegas. com, mostly because the price was fantastic. \n\nWhen we arrived, the check in was reasonably quick, and our room was clean and comfortable. A little dated, but not bad really. \n\nFor its' price, location, and convenience Excalibur is just fine. I don't think it deserves the low ratings it gets."
3,"Took my team here for lunch and we all got the Thursday special - Duck leg confit.  It was delicious, great ambience and overall experience.  Dessert was also great - the service was kind of slow but we had a nice relaxing lunch. I would definitely recommend this place for good food."
0,"It's pretty pricey for things you'd think would be pretty cheap. I went there looking for birthday presents for a friend, and they didn't have what I needed, and the cashier got kinda pushy about me buying something else... I just wanted to leave. Was uncomfortable. I won't be back."
1,"This place is bootleg.  Been to several Capital Grille's and imo, the only one worth visiting more than once is in Boston.\n\nI will say the steak is good and this place would earn 3-4 stars in other cities, but in comparing it to other LV steakhouses, it's a 2.   \n\nOther minor dig - it has way too much of an \""expense account\"" vibe - definitely not conducive to a fun Vegas evening."
3,I really enjoy this place. It's low-key and upscale. Drinks are expensive but they're made on the strong side. The food is really go too. I've never had a dish I didn't enjoy. \n\nIt's a great place to sit down and enjoy a cocktail and have a conversation. The crowd looks like 26 and up.  I consistently have a positive experience here.
3,"I've been really into froyo since trying Pinkberry on my various trips to LA. I've been on the hunt for something close back here in AZ. I've read the previous reviews and I think they must have improved a lot of the problems since I've discovered it because I haven't been aware of any of them.\n\nI think this place is the best in froyo against the Mojo and Yogurtland I've visited. I like that they have a variety of flavors but am bummed when I go in and they don't have them. As long as they have the original tart I can be happy.\n\nMy favorite flavors are green apple and mango, and the fruit is always fresh and sweet. The place is decorated like any other cute little froyo joint and the girl behind the counter is always nice. Although I can't imagine what it must be like when it's packed and people are asking for samples because whenever I go in it's not busy.\n\nOverall, it's a low-key and tasty froyo spot. It's a bit far from where I live but it's worth the drive for good frozen yogurt. I also dig the reward point system they have - it definitely makes the trip a bit better."
2,"This place is pretty cool. They have 70\"" LED TVS on opposite walls. A cool place to hang out and socialize. Nice colors in the interior and it's clean--the bathroom, too. Cute Asian girls making Boba is always a plus. Mexican girls too. And a Mexican guy at the cash register--Don't know why....jk.  \n\nAnyway the boba is ok....powdery..too sweet...well i guess all boba drinks are made from powder. I wish they have fresh durian or something. But its tastes ok to me..If I'm in the area, but wont drive from Phoenix."
3,"Nice selection of cigars and a sophisticated, wide ranging bar and cocktail menu. Mojitos are very authentic.\nOdd comment for a cigar bar but we found it a little too smoky late at night."
0,"Took my boyfriend out to eat here July 31st, 2014 for his birthday. As I was eating my dumplings I realized that they were raw inside (note picture that was uploaded). I pointed this out to the waitress and she just took my plate and made no offer to resolve the situation. I have now eaten raw pork due to their negligence and have been feeling woozy ever since. I will NEVER be doing business with this company again."
3,"Great shisha, reallly small and busy place. Friendly Arabic environment\n\nThe street is totally under construction, so you its a maze to get to the front door"
4,We had an A/C unit go out at 11pm and I called and asked for a tech early the next morning.  Robert showed up promptly at 8am and took care of the repair quickly. The price was reasonable.  Two days later our other unit went out and I called in the afternoon.  They said they were booked up and I let them know we really were hoping to get somebody out that night.  The receptionist called me back after talking to the owner and he said he would personally show up as long as I didn't mind it being a little later.  He showed up right at 9pm and took care of the issue.  Everything has been great!
0,"What can be said? I've been going to the restaurant for years... YEARS! But yesterday I was thoroughly disappointed. The food has taken a major turn for the worst... Gone is the freshness, gone is the cleanliness and GONE is the tastiness. Sushi: We ordered Sashimi and a couple of roles. The one thing you expect from Sushi is freshness... Takamatsu sushi had all the indicators of DAYS in the fridge.  It was beyond belief. The fish was stale and gray. The GINGER! This stuff comes from bottles was old and smelled like pine sol... Come on man. I could have brought in fresher ginger.  Now to the main course. The bulgogi... The mainstay of Korean food... horrible. HORRIBLE I SAY. This was not bulgogi. This was super thinly sliced beef, god I hope it was beef, that had been stored in fridge and they later found and decided not to let it go to waste.  Side dishes were okay, but lacked flavor and freshness. Lastly comes the cleanliness. This should be the easiest thing to achieve in a restaurant. Don't need a pricey chef, waiter or creativity... Just need a bucket, cleaning solution, a mop and some backbone. Don't go near the bathrooms or you will find your shoes stuck to the floor like a roach motel. Don't believe me, take a sticky strole passed the sushi bar. After all was said and done and paid my fine of ~$80 to be released from Takamatsu. Lets put it this way fellow foodies. If I knew the food tasted this badly they could not have paid me $80 to eat it. \n\nTakamatsi is an embarrassment to honest Korean Restaurants in the valley.  They should close or get their act together before someone is hurt badly with their food.  If you decide to go there and get disappointed, don't blame me. I tried my best to provide you a fair warning. \n\nThus my review... \nService great  \nPrice: $80 for two adults\nCleanliness:     ...............\nFood Bad.... VERY Bad"
0,"I thought I had been to the slowest Starbucks ever. This one is slower.   You know what I want to do in Las Vegas? Sit in Starbucks for half an hour waiting for a frappuccino. Luckily, it only took 3 times to get them to put espresso in the drink."
1,"I wish I could give a better review, but I wasn't completely satisfied. When I booked the limo, I specified that the sedan town car was what I wanted. The driver showed up in an SUV instead. I was never told there was a possibility I could get an entirely different vehicle. Also, there was no passenger seat  - I had mentioned that I wanted one. Finally, the person booking the reservation asked me if I would like the driver to hold up a sign with the last name of our party. SInce it was a wedding, I thought it would be perfect. I gave her all the information and she said it was all set. There was no sign or any mention of it when the limo pulled up. I asked the limo driver about it later and he said he had no idea about any sign. Why does Presidential offer it if they won't fulfill the request?"
1,"Avoid. It reminds me of a Hometown Buffet chain. The food is plentiful as is the selection, and some of the items are good. But the it comes off as a cheap cafeteria. It looks old and run down, and some of the food looks like its been sitting there forever."
2,"Amazing amount of TVs for the size of the place. Really large selection of beers in bottle & on tap, though the best options are in the bottle - hope they revisit their tap selection soon. Burger was good, I preferred it to the one's I've had at Burger Rehab. Great place to watch a game(s)."
0,This place is closed...\nNot sure why yelp hasn't updated the information yet...
1,"Wanted to try this place since it had the shortest wait time... well now I know why.. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the black pepper chicken didn't have much flavor at all.. I was very disappointed and will not be coming back."
3,This facility has an abundance of reading materials.  There is a very good selection of CD's.  You will also find a decent selection of movies.  The wireless connectivity is pretty good.
4,I come to Las Vegas once a year and this is the only place I go to for pizza!  The atmosphere and service are great and the food delicious.
2,"Came here while hanging at the pool for a change from the greasy pool food they serve. It was pretty good, not too pricey, and chips and salsa were pretty decent."
0,Service merdique!  La serveuse m'a demand\u00e9 pourquoi je lui a avais donn\u00e9 10% de tip!  Quelle insulte!
2,"We stayed there for 3 days and the place was okay. \nThe room was very clean and quite large with a nice view of the desert.  Indeed everywhere was very clean. The pool was a good size, heated too with a Jacuzzi.\n\nWhat lets it down was service. If this was in a big town they'd struggle.\n\nThe restaurant service was terrible for the Thursday morning breakfast we had , its called the Lariat. I reviewed that separately.\n\nThey offer a free shuttle to town which you will need to get there as its 1-2 miles away unless you want a cab. We tried 3 shuttles which  are advertised as being every hour on the hour. Each time there was no driver when we got to the shuttle and we had to hassle the front desk for a person to come. Eventually 5-10 minutes later a person would drive us to town.\n If you advertise that you run it hourly you have to have someone there.  Its hard to plan a night in town if you cant be sure when you'll get there.  You call for a pick up back to the resort and that worked far better.\n\nThe first day we had the do not disturb sign on until 10.30am and again from  12.45-2.15pm.  We received no maid service  at all or a call from the front desk saying that we wouldn't.  Not the end of the world but not good service either.\n\nThe resort itself is lacking in activities. I hear resort and think lots to do but there was no more to do here than a Holiday Inn. It just had a nicer pool and optional tennis.  Massages are a 100 dollars, not exactly a deal.\n\nThey've the makings of a good place here but could do so much better.  \n\nThe WiFi was excellent."
3,"We came here for dinner and the food was excellent!  All of our steaks and fish were cooked perfectly!  BUT the service was very slow...we waited a little over an hour for our food.  Since we were celebrating my grandpa's birthday, they gave him a box of truffles and a $25 gift card.  \n\nFood rating= 4.5 \nService rating=3"
0,I cosigned my car with these guys and they failed me miserably. Not only did they sell my car for about half of what it was worth but their customer service was horrid. These guys do not care about anything except making their outrageous fees and commissions. They will say anything to get you to cosign without a reserve but don't do it! Once you sign you can kiss your ass and your car good bye. Any of the other auction houses will treat you much better and let you protect yourself with a reasonable reserve.
3,"Great service, love the Gyro and Athens Fries"
3,"Ok, here's the thing.....I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio eating Polish, German and Slovenian meat & sausage.  Best places back home to buy this kind of thing are on 185th Street, the ethnic \""hood.\""   Moving to Phoenix meant lots of sunshine, no snow and no sausage like I was used to.  The closest I could find to home was Stanley's on Bell Road.  They have a wonderful selection and the girls smile every time I go in and ask, \""Now how do you pronounce that?\""  My favorite is the rice sausage that's made with liver.  It is in a ring and bakes up great in the oven!  Short of making a trip back to Cleveland & 185th Street or the West Side Market, this is GOOD STUFF!   Do I shop there all the time?  Nope, but it's definitely the place to go to stock up for ethnic holiday types of meals, especially at Easter and Christmas time.  \n\nI stopped at Shreiner's last week on my way home from work and was a little dissappointed.  They were out of a lot of stuff, didn't even seem familiar with my favorites, but the young girl working there was very nice.  She told me they don't make the type of sausage I was looking for, but suggested I try some Brats.   Not exactly what I wanted, but I decided to try some. They were okay, but for the really good, authentic ethnic sausage I love, I'll keep going to Stanley's!"
4,"I'm married to a Japanese and work for Japanese company. I've been to Japan I don't know how many times and have eaten well there. This is simply top class, I'd even say special. The style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure Japanese to Japanese with some very tasteful western inflections. I'm not in Phoenix often. But this will be on my list every time I go if I have anything to say about it."
1,"I stayed here at the Sahara with a friend who got the room comp'd and it was \""okay\"". I wouldn't pay for it.\n\nThe check-in lines I noticed were extremely long. I requested a non-smoking room but clearly the room they gave us smelled like cigarettes (especially the bed). Perhaps they were giving us the shaft because it was a \""free\"" room, but I really didn't like that.\n\nOn the second day while I was in the shower, the water suddenly turned off. My friend called the front desk while I stormed to the lobby to find out what the hell was going on. Apparently, there was a leak on our side of the hotel and all of the water was shut off. Okay, thanks for the heads up guys! The only highlight of that was we got moved to a much nicer room.\n\nI enjoy coming to Sahara for the gambling, it's one of the cheapest on the strip but the place is a bit far from the mega casinos so I'd probably stay somewhere else next time I'm in Vegas. Last time I was in Vegas, I got a really good rate at Tropicana which I would take again if I was on a budget simply because it's closer to all the action. I had a rental car anyway because I drove to Vegas, so the distance wasn't a big deal but if I didn't have a car it would have definitely been a pain. I'd probably pick Hooters or Tropicana if I wanted to go hotel cheap next time.\n\nI have to agree with other yelpers there is a total lack of $1 tables. I'd definitely would have played more at Sahara, but I didn't see any of these supposed $1 tables my entire weekend! Perhaps it is more of a weekday thing?\n\nI ate at the NASCAR bar, didn't care to try the buffet it looked crappy. Food was really greasy.\n\nThe pool wasn't bad though.\n\nI doubt I'd come back to Sahara, ever honestly."
2,The meat is bbq less. Who wants to add sauce to their own bbq...not me. It was 3 star worthy. The fries & beans were just ok. Will I return maybe.
2,"While not for everyone, I find this store to be just fine for me when I need to pick up a few things for dinner and get some (great) donuts for my husband. It's also a great store for moms with young children or the elderly since everything is compact and easy to reach or get to. The staff seems to work like an extended family, friendly with customers and maybe a bit too open about their personal lives. Now that competitive stores are being built around the older strip mall where it resides, I fear for the outcome of this little store that I can walk or bike to."
2,"When I spend $200+ dollars on a meal, I expect everything to be perfect...not the case!  They burned the garlic bread, and their calamari was of poor quality (lots of squid bodies, not enough meaty rings).  I cannot even remember what I had for the main-course (and Valentine's day meals are usually memorable for me).  The food is priced entirely too high considering the quality and it was just not worth the money.  Overall I say meh...the service was great but that's about it."
1,"Worst fillet mignon I've ever had!! Medium does not mean charred and dry!! The soup of the day was alright, but nothing to write home about. Not going back."
2,"Lux is SO bi-polar. Half the time the music is unbearable- industrial and LOUD and the service is little more than a grunt from the guy taking your order and your money. The other half of the time the music is Jazz and very conducive to drinking coffee and talking and seemingly more appropriate for the environment. Every once in a while there will be a semi-friendly face at the register, but not very often, in fact it is rare- I once made the mistake of ordering a small drink and they snarled at me that they \""only pull double shots\"" which I had read only moments earlier on the menu but had already forgotten (mommy brain) but they definitely could have handled that a little more nicely. They have books and other kid entertainment so I know they WANT to be kid friendly but the loud industrial music has got to go. The coffee is good and the environment is cool. The pastries are heavenly. I would have only given them 2 stars but the owners are pretty cool and I have hope that they will become more consistent with the music and service. I haven't been there in  a while, mainly for fear of a bad experience but I will give it another chance. I hope they become less focused on being \""cool\"" and more focused on giving customers a genuinely well rounded- good experience."
2,Used to be better. Now I'm not sure what they're trying to do exactly but it's just ok.\n\nService was terrible though! The place was not busy and we managed to get an order of appetizers and 1 round of drinks in with the absent server in an hour. Not a great way to serve in Vegas (or anywhere).\n\nGot the appetizer sampler. A nice twist on basic bar food but at the end of the day it's still greasy bar food. Philly cheesesteak potstickers were the stand out. \n\nThey used to do this great pretzel bread but it's gone. That's kinda why we stopped here in the first place.\n\nToo many other great choices in Vegas. I doubt we'll be back.
4,Best mexican food in Vegas.
3,"My 10 year old boys had fun.  A little pricey but it is clean, well lit and not too loud.  For the adults....the wifi blows, the food is not very good and expensive.  A small iced latte was just under $5.  Can't bring anything in either....(and Pepsi products..ick).\n\nAll attractions/games were in good working condition."
4,"So ono! Wonderful fish, wonderful service! I can't believe I didn't find out about this place sooner. I'm bummed they're closed tomorrow!"
4,"When is anyone ever compelled to write a review about a parking lot?? Well, this one really sets a new standard. A once dreaded experience of searching for secure parking and getting to the airport on time has been turned into an experience where the normal hassles are eliminated. \n\nThey offer covered parking. Spaces are not crammed together. Shuttle driver helps you with your bags immediately and pulls up right when you park (no wasted time - perfect for a commuter who is normally cutting it close to get to the gate). \n\nThe icing on the cake is really the Paradise cookie voucher - a sweet treat to top off the experience. Again, when do you get rewarded with a free cookie just for doing something as mundane as parking your car?"
4,Love it and love the GF menu.  It's amazing how many dishes they have
3,If you sneak into the bakery before or after the lunch rush you can snag a cinnamon roll. These are the best cinnamon rolls I've found in Phoenix. They aren't subtle. There is often enough frosting (not the creamy kind) to put you in a sugar coma. The staff are polite and quick.\nDon't forget to tip!
3,Wow lines can get extremely long for tis place ! I went two times on my trip because it was just to good to pass up. Both times I gopt the chicken sandwiches the one with the hot peppers was amazing ! The other with the cheese and bacon and lettuce I did not care for the sauce. The coffee is also amazing !! I got a greek salad one time all the ingredients were just so fresh for a fast food places and very decent quality. This place is also open 24 hours in Planet Hollywod ! Food comes out really fast and the lines go pretty fast too !
2,"We stopped by Dominion Square Tavern for a late dinner after driving in from Michigan. The space had a great tavernish atmosphere and we were seated right away even though we had expected to have to wait.\n\nWe had the fish cake, the scotch egg, and the mussels. The fish cakes (kind of like crab cakes but with fish) had strong smoke notes and was a bit salty. The scotch egg was done really well, crispy on the outside with a delicious meat layer and an oozing egg in the center. The mussels were well portioned for two people to share and were tasty. Didn't find a single closed shell in the bunch.\n\nOverall, I think the food was executed well and the service was friendly and prompt. For the price though, I was expecting to be wowed a bit more."
2,"To put it straight, our server was awkward. We were a group of four chicks, so I'm not sure if he was nervous or what... but there was some definite strangeness going on.\n\nThe crab dip is pretty bomb if you like big chunks of avocado... Which I do... Mmmmm.. Also had the green Chile enchilada is super delish. Supposedly it's a spicy dish but I'm super anti-spice and I didn't notice it.\n\nThe super awesome bigass patio is pretty cool, especially with all the romantic lighting. This COULD potentially be an excellent spot to just chill and have a drink with your buds, but we were surprised to be told at 10pm that it was time to close down shop. :P"
1,"The food was ok. I received very slow service, and although my waitress was very nice, it was just slow. I didn't get asked what I would like to drink for five minutes after being seated, even though the place wasn't too busy (it was 1am). Also I wasn't even greeted upon entry. It was expensive, and the portions were tiny. I wouldn't mind so much if the service made up for the portions, but it didn't. What was I paying for? Service? No. Food? No. It was disappointing."
2,"Recently I started going to this Costco when the Business Center stopped selling cigarettes for personal consumption and left this as the only Costco in the West valley that sells cigarettes.  I don't like the layout as well as Arrowhead and because it is out of the way for me I quite often end up going here during busy times instead of weekday evenings when things are a bit quieter.  I just stopped by the morning before Thanksgiving and the place looked like a Saturday afternoon 10 minutes after opening.  And the system for cigarettes places a burden on the rest of the customers who do not smoke by making the entire line wait for somebody to go get the cigarettes.  I'll still keep coming to this one when I need to but I will go to Arrowhead for restocking stuff in the pantry, like the Langers OJ which this location did not have when I looked for it."
0,This place is the worst.  It is super dirty not the best part of town.  It looks like they never wash any sheets the place smells!!  I notice some of the good reviews on this place is for the casino next door that is part of the Hotel so don't be fooled
0,"I love Indian cuisine, and being still fairly new to the valley, I'm trying to find the best places in town for Indian food.  I bought a Groupon for Madras Ananda Bhavan a few months ago and decided to go for dinner last night.\n\nAs we approached I saw a sign on their front door warning/ advising customers that if they use a Groupon gratuity will be automatically added to their bill.  I found that to be an odd and ostracizing thing to do, but at least they were upfront about it.\n\nWe arrived before 6pm and it was pretty quiet, with only a few tables present. Nice. I enjoy quiet dining.  The sign said to wait to be seated. We only had to wait a few seconds before we were seated and the menus were brought. I informed them right away that I'd be using a Groupon.  I advised the waiter that I was vegan and inquired about the menu items in which I was interested. He was knowledgeable, helpful, and very friendly (awesome smiles!).\n\nWe ordered vegetable samosas ($3.50). They were huge and very good. Crunchy & golden on the outside; savory and spicy on the inside. Their tamarind sauce is stronger and more tart than to what I am accustomed, but it was ok.  I prefer the sweeter based tamarind sauces though. \n\nI ordered the Gobi Manchurian ($8.99). It was absolutely AMAZING! The cauliflower was so perfectly crisp and that red sauce (not spicy) is so flavorful. Outstanding vegan dish!\n\nI ordered plain puri/poori ($2.99 for 2 pieces), which is a light vegan bread.  Plain puri/poori is not on the menu (the menu offers stuffed puris), but just ask for it. It was very good. \n\nMy dinner mate ordered naan ($2), and the server advised me not to eat it because it contains dairy.  (Good looking out!) She thought her naan was a little too burnt for her liking. \n\n\nHere's where things go badly...\n\nMy non-vegan dinner mate wanted Aloo Saag, which is not on the menu.  The waiter advised that she could order Saag Paneer ($10.99) and add aloo (potatoes), so that's what she did.  (Note to vegan's who are not familiar with Indian cuisine: saag = spinach, & paneer = cheese, so this is not a vegan dish.  If you'd like a spinach dish, inquire about them making a vegan version, like Aloo Saag with no dairy.) She really enjoyed her dish until.... she noticed a long piece of hair in her spoonful of saag.  Process of elimination: she has very long, naturally curly/wavy hair, so it was definitely not her own hair.  I was sitting across the table and never came near her food, but for s&g let's just add that I have extremely curly hair, so it most certainly was not my hair. I examined it closely to ensure that it wasn't an herb of some sort, but it was indeed a hair follicle.  Despite my OCD-ness screaming on the inside, I was very calm and maintained a smile as I called over the owner and pointed out the snafu. He apologized profusely, promptly took away the tainted food, and brought her a new dish with new naan.\n\nOur dishes were served with a small helping of rice. What is up with the instant white rice?? You get @ 2 spoonfuls of this plain and dry rice. Where is the moist, fluffy, herb-infused, flavor-bursting basmati rice?  Very disappointing!\n\nPitchers of water were sitting on each table, even the unoccupied ones. Having a pitcher of water at your table is definitely a plus for me because I drink a lot of water.  However, with that pesky nat (it drove me crazy!) and any other germs flying around, I did not like that the water had just been sitting there for who knows how long (long enough that the ice had melted). And it's a waste of water when you get an OCD customer like myself, who will ask you to bring a fresh pitcher of water with ice in it.  Just bring out the pitcher once the customer arrives. \n\nThe bill came and there were 0 concessions for the hair situation. Yes, you brought out a new dish. That's expected. No, I did not appear to be angry, but I was livid and disgusted. There was HAIR in my baby's food! Department of Health &/or Public Safety, hello?! I just chose to behave in a civil and professional manner.  Wrong is wrong, and one should not have to rant and rave or throw a hissy fit to be accommodated in such circumstances.  I did not ask, but as a customer service gesture, that dish should've been removed from my bill.  Despite the excellent Gobi Manchurian and puri/ poori, or the friendly smiles, that was a deal-breaker, so sadly, I have no plans to return."
4,"This is the place to go for all of your beer and liquor needs.\nThey really are the cheapest in the city.\nI come here for Heineken only. A 12pk will run you $11 and some change.\n\nThere's always plenty of parking.\nStore his huge, bright and very clean.\nWide variety of alcohol. More than what any one human needs.\nStaff is very friendly."
1,"Visited on a Wednesday for the lunch buffet and arrived around 1120am. When my roommate and I first got there, we were the only patrons there!  I thought perhaps we were early, but throughout our meal only one other table with two customers were there and when they left a mother and daughter came in towards the end of our meal.  Our waiter was friendly, he came to refill our waters twice.  Other than that we really didn't see him.  I was a bit disappointed in the selection. There were 3 vegetarian /vegetable options, 3 chicken options and a couple of of other things like soup, potato wedges, and rice pudding that was extremely soupy. I am a vegetarian, so I was already limited in my choices.  At one point I went back to get some more rice and the rice was never refilled, so I was literally scrapping the bowl!  I mostly ate a dish with broccoli in a tomato sauce, which was by far my most favored item on the day's buffet menu.  While I did have an enjoyable time with my roommate, my taste buds were not jumping for joy as I had previously imagined that they would.  I love Indian food, but my experience at Bombay Grille was although not horrible, was also not what I would envision as something to be repeated.\n\nNormally at buffets I can usually eat between 2-3 plates.  Their food was extremely heavy and could only eat one full plate.  After leaving the restaurant I took a nap and very long walk afterwards, and I still was full to the point of being uncomfortable.  I am grateful that I did not have to work that day, I would have been miserable.  I even thought that possibly they put heavy cream in their food, but of course I am not in their kitchen, so that will go unknown.  Food has never made me feel that way.  \n\nKey points that I was disappointed in were:\n1. Buffets usually have a great selection, so that a person can sample several different dishes- Bombay Grille failed here.\n2. Indian buffets usually have at least one dish with paneer- Bombay Grille failed here.\n3. Indian buffets are supposed to have several different curry dishes (mild, medium, spicy and different kinds of curry). There was only one curry chicken dish.- FAIL\n4. Bombay Grille- FAILed to refill the rice.. there were only 4 people in there at any given time!!!!  I'd hate to see what the buffet would like after 20 minutes if it was packed or even half way full.\n5. Where were the spices? It's bad enough that there wasn't any good curry or paneer, but I couldn't taste any spices.  In my opinion, this is an Americanized Indian restaurant. I could not taste any pepper, cardamon, anise, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, saffron, tamarind or turmeric! -FAIL\n7. Naan- didn't taste like it was homemade.. looked and tasted like store bought and it was plain.. they didn't have garlic naan!  By the time I had some, it was cold, chewy and blah.  No ghee and naan!  No spices or raisin and naan.  NOT SATISFIED!\n6. The price for the selection. - FAIL\n\nThe decor is slightly plain.. the only redeeming quality was what I was craving for over a month since moving to Charlotte.. a Mango Lassi.\n\nOverall, I would not return to this restaurant.. the food quality, selection and price were less than stellar.  I've heard great things about \""Passage to India\"" in the University area and can't wait to check it out!"
0,Hair in our sushi. All servers with their long hair down? Not fresh. Not good. Won't be back.
1,Completely over-rated. Have you been to Quiznos? That will give you an idea of what's going on here.\n\nAm I crazy here?  Most of my Yelp buddies have given this palce great reviews but I whole-heartedly disagree.\n\nHad the Jerk Chicken and the Full Montagu.  I had to double check the sticker on the wrapper to make sure I didn't get some sort of Italian chicken sandwich. There was no jerk flavor whatsoever. Tasted more like the chicken was drizzled in Italian dressing.  The Montague was better but nothing to rave about.\n\nI must admit the operation is smooth and the fact that it's open all the time in Vegas is a definite plus.  I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place.
1,"One word: OVERRATED\n\nThe pizza was subpar. Ive had much better for the price.\n\nMy group was smart and made a reservation, i really didnt enjoy the dirty looks and comments we got from some of the line that had been waiting (for what im still not sure) when we went in ahead of them.\n\nI really wasnt impressed."
1,"I came here for lunch for Restaurant Week with one guest around 2pm.\n\nVerdict: Come here if you're an executive working nearby who wants a yummy soup and salad and make the disgruntled employees feel like trash (someone with their big handbag wouldn't move out of the aisle). Don't come here if you believe in genuine meals.  \n\nAmbiance: 5/5\nYou are greeted by delicious scents and sunshine as you walk in. High ceilings and bright lighting help to set the mood. Rustic yet polished, it sets expectations for an unpretentious lunch.\n\nService: 2/5\nHostess did not smile or greet, tried to wave waiter down to order something else and even made eye contact (gave up after trying three times), and not a single \""how are enjoying your meal\"" was given. So, I took off a star for each. Food was timely, hence two stars. \n\nFood: 2/5\nTheir quinoa salad was amazing: Light, refreshing, and fluffy. Everything after was average or lackluster. Their burger was balanced, but the chicken was reminiscent of Jack. Thin meat, not particularly tender, no juice. Bun was good, but average for a gourmet burger. The salad might have saved the meal, but the cheese chunks were cloying. Key Lime pie was too tart: I felt the top of my nose slightly sweet. \n\nValue: 2/5\nTo the owner's benefit, I appreciate their participation in Restaurant Week to benefit charity. That kindness is not being disputed in this review. What is being disputed, though, is if I will come back here regularly. At the price point of $30 per person, I have had friendly and attentive service, balanced flavor profiles with rare ingredients, and pleasant memories elsewhere for American upscale casual. Especially since the regular menu adds up more, this actually further decreases value. \n\nMood and Stomach after the meal: Hmph. \nTotal rating: 2 out of 5."
4,Awesome tasting pizza!
3,"What can you say about an airport? I'm sure someone out there will find plenty of things to complain about but I have flown in and out of PHX for years and never had any issues. I even flew out on the first day open after 9/11 and everyone was great and things were running smoothly. I can't complain, they know what their doing down in PHX."
1,Rude workers... ugh. Good fast food and that's about it lol. Not worth my anger to get some cheap food. Palermos at 83rd and lower buckeye is better.
0,"This might be the worst Chinese I've ever tasted in my life...and i'm a college student so I've had a lot. I don't have a car so i ordered the sesame chicken and the beef with broccoli to go...two of my favorite standby dishes. the sesame was way too battered and was smothered with the sauce so much that i was literally scraping it off. it's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff...nasty. and the beef with broccoli was worse! it tasted like the \"" brown sauce\"" was day old gravy and the meat was like the mystery meat that you'd get at a middle school cafeteria. on second though i think my cafeteria was better. and the broccoli tasted acidic. it was just so gross id rather have just ordered pizza. seriously, don't go here."
4,I have nothing but positive things to say about Henry's place. My whole family and I have been taking our cars to him for years and we have never been let down. I recommend him to everyone. BEST mechanic in town!!
0,"Went last night with a group of friends and the bouncers were a**holes with us. This isn't New York and you are not a high end club. Have some respect for your patrons, if they want to buy a bottle don't make them wait for 30 minutes while you let everyone and their mother in."
1,"I was quite happy when this restaurant first opened because there was finally an option for grabbing dinner before a Pen's game that wasn't the Souper Bowl (dirty, crowded, nasty food) or the Steelhead Grille (very,very expensive).  The decor is nice and upscale, and the food was consistently good, but the servers were hit-or-miss.   And the place was always packed before the games so we had to arrive early to get seated and enjoy our dinner.\n\nBecause of the NHL strike and other factors, we hadn't been to a game in 10 months.  Something very bad happened at Red Ring in those months.\nThe meal portions have decreased and the entrees we ordered just weren't as good as they used to be.  And, really, the meals are served in red plastic baskets with a lovely checked piece of paper underneath?  Are we at the beach ordering fried seafood?  Their presentation used to be quite good, now it's... plastic baskets.  And our server was one of the worst we have had in our 3(?) years of eating meals there.\n\nWe noticed as we were leaving that there are no longer lines of people to be seated, and it made sense.  Many of their former customers are going elsewhere-- but WHERE?   We will probably not be back unless our only option is the Souper Bowl..."
2,"Went here yesterday for a late lunch/early dinner. \n\nWhat we sampled: \nBanana Slama Margaritas (where on happy hour special 16oz. for 5 dollars!  Tottally worth it and delicious)\nSan Francisco Insane Wings (hot and delicious!)\nPica Dippa Peppita hummus, xx chesse dip, guacamole (could have done without this, the flavors where off and weren't that interesting)\nCarnitas Burrito (very hard to share between two people, but very delicious)\nIce Cream Burrito 1/2 Saturday 1/2 Sunday style (OMG a must try insane)\n\nOverall the food quality was good, but with so many great places to eat I don't know that I would be rushing back."
3,"El lugar es elegante y tradicional, con mucha madera. El servicio es bueno.\nPed\u00ed el rib eye y tengo que decir que me sorprendi\u00f3 positivamente. Como Argentina estoy acostumbrada a carne de calidad a la parrilla sin otro condimento que sal, sin embargo este bife estaba muy bien condimentado, era muuuy tierno y sabroso y ten\u00eda una salsa de manteca derretida que le daba al plato otra dimensi\u00f3n. Inolvidable. Los acompa\u00f1amientos est\u00e1n muy bien. Pidan el vino argentino, no se van a arrepentir."
4,"Real third wave coffee. Nice shop, excellent beans, and disgusting bathrooms, just like any good coffee shop :-)"
0,"Slow, disorganized service and a very rude manager who did absolutely nothing to help the wait staff or us. This isn't the first time we've experienced this service, but it's definitely the last. The patio is nice, but there are other options in the area with better service and food."
3,Place is very busy but well worth the wait. People in town say it's the best pho place to eat. My food has been amazing both times I have been there this week. Our server didn't listen to my order and when I told her it was wrong but I ate it she didn't care lol. I will still go back because it's that good.
1,"We had made reservations through Open Table for Pampas at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. Upon arriving for our 7pm reservation, we were told that they did not have our reservation and that there is a  waiting list and it will be 20 to 30 minute wait, which turned out to be a 45 minute wait. My thing is if you have reservations then why don't you have a record that you did receive it. They commented and said that it is better to call in your reservation instead of making it on the website or through Open Table website or app. Other than this experience the food and service was very good."
3,"Great pizza! It was perfect! Naturally I had to dab some grease off but it's the perfect amount of doh with a slight crisp and it was really yummy! They have chicken wings too but they're like curry flavor, just sayin' don't get me wrong tho they were delicious! They have a couple beers on tap and it was a great place to stop for a bite to eat and a bit to drink before we entered cirque se solei next door! We liked it! The service was good as well."
1,uhm i get that im in vegas and things cost more...but ROFL WOW. theres a reasonable point in paying for something. \n\nto be dramatic...its like paying 10$ for a piece of gum.
4,".., I underestimated this buffet. But now after having eaten here, I feel it's underrated. \n\nAfter a previous stay @ South Point, we were equipped w/ a handy little coupon book for our next visit. Luckily my gf remembered to bring it this trip & we scored on a free buffet gut buster during our stay here for the 4th of July.  \n\nI admit I was bashing on the Garden Buffet's name for it didn't sound promising. Being an obnoxious carnivor, the \""Garden\"" part in Garden Buffet didn't sound tempting at all. Little did I know, I was wrong.\n\nAfter working up an appettite during our little roulette/blackjack binge, we wanted to try out our free buffet coupon. It was free during the weekdays & it said nothing about any blackout days during the holidays. So we waited a smooth half hour in line chatting it up w/ fellow South Point visitors. \n\nWe were seated & hopped in the buffet line immedietely. I had myself a protein orgy!!!\n\nHere's what I had from what I remember:\n\nbratwurst w/ sauerkraut - excellent\ntons of bacon- excellent\ntop round- eh, it was ok, tasted bland\nrigatoni pasta w/ pesto sauce- excellent\nscrambed eggs- excellent\nhashbrowns-excellent\nchicken gumbo- superb\nfried chicken- excellent\nItalian wedding soup- superb\nroast beef w/ au jus- tasty\nstrawberry cheesecake- excellent\n\nService was attentive, not your typical balls out fancy buffet, but it got the job done. I was very pleased with this buffet, especially with it being free? We will definately come back! Staying @ South Point? Check em' out!"
3,"I really can't comment on the \""value\"" because my company picked up the tab, but I can say that the service they gave us was great and the food was good. I had their 16 oz steak and their cheesecake/sweet potato crust (both delicious!). Would be open to come back again."
1,"Service - some good, some awful\n\nFood - Ok, nothing great\n\nI sat at the bar for lunch, which was a little more than half full.  Unfortunately there was only one bar tender working, and she was having to move very fast to try to keep up with everything going on.  \n\nI ordered an appetizer and a sandwich - after about 15 minutes the sandwich arrived, but no appetizer.  The runner called over the bar tender, and they offered to take the sandwich back and keep it warm until I was ready for it - I said no, I would take the sandwich and they should take the appetizer off the bill.  After I was done with the sandwich and fries, waiting for check, the appetizer came out, and tried to get me to take it to go.  I was out for the day, and I wasn't going to leave the food in the car on a 100 degree day to spoil.\n\nThe cajun sandwich was tasty, but greasy and too messy - plan on having several pieces falling out of the sandwich (and chances are down your shirt)\n\nwas a disappointment to say the least"
2,"Though the smell of the place can really get to you, the instructors here are amazing.  Down side is the people at the front desk are extremely rude and not very friendly.  If customer service were good all around I would have continued to come to this studio. But since it's all the way on the other side of town I think I'll have to opt out for a more welcoming environment.  \n\nOther than the downsides, they have a clean changing area with 2 showers where they provide body wash, shampoo, and conditioner so you can wash off all the nasty sweat after your classes. \n\nTry catching Summer and Stacy. They're both awesome in their own way."
1,"I used to go here all the time but then they dropped a bomb an discontinued one of my favorite plates..... The International Club. I thought all restaurants like these had at least one version of a club on their menu but that doesn't seem to be the case here anymore. Aren't club sandwiches a staple food for diners? Oh well :(\nThey did remodel the whole restaurant awhile back but I haven't been back since the so called \""Improvements.\"""
0,"Let me start out by saying that I USED to love the Penguin- before it switched management. (If you want the old Penguin awesomeness, see The Diamond.)\n\nThe new Penguin is not great. Used to be crowded and jovial and loud- now it's virtually empty and so, so quiet. \n\nThey were out of a handful of things that our group ordered (some of the sodas, chicken wings, etc.). Our waiter would take orders, come back, tell us they were out, take a new order, come back. This happened 2 or 3 times.\n\nI also requested a veggie burger with no bun, but iceberg lettuce in place of a bun. Like a veggie burger between 2 pieces of lettuce. This request absolutely blew our waiters mind and, while he treated me like a culinary genius from that point on, it really isn't an innovative enough idea that a waiter should be surprised by it. Or need a 5 minute explanation about it. \n\nWhen the food came (it took a while), most of us were missing toppings or sides. None of the veggies that should have come on my burger were there. The onions that my husband requested were not there. \n\nI actually feel bad for the staff. I have a sneaking suspicion that our waiter hadn't gotten proper training and maybe communication between staff and management is poor. I blame management, not the wait staff.  It's such a shame- The Penguin used to be so awesome."
1,"There is a certain amount of novelty to being cycled around town on a pedicab.  It offers a rustic outlook to travel around town, but unfortunately it's unbelievably expensive.  When I hear how much people have paid for these pedicabs, I'm surprised that they even have that amount of money on them in the first place.\n\nPrice aside, and it's a big thing to put aside, they are in abundance in tourist spots and around clubs and for those who've had a bit too much to drink and unable to get in a real taxi might find them of use.  This only leaves the last concern which is speed and these are very slow hence why it ends up costing so much.\n\nDespite all this I do have a degree of admiration for the drivers - it's not the easiest work especially in the hilly areas."
1,The Phoenician is a dated property and in need of a facelift.  Spend your money elsewhere!
4,"My boss and I casually heard about this place while we were working in Vegas for the week... We heard it was the best this and that and the other thing, it was in some strip mall of Sarah 15 mins from the strip, blah blah blah... We had Sunday off so we caught a movie and decided to bop over to Rosemary's. I had a beanie and a white T-Shirt on and I felt pretty confident walking into what I thought was some mom and pop restaurant next to the DOLLAR TREE in a STRIP CENTER. \n\nWe opened the doors to one of the nicest restaurants I have ever set foot in. I immediately felt ashamed in my dingy Sunday-worst clothing, but strangely not uncomfortable. \n\nFrom the onset my boss and I were treated with the utmost respect and care. We were seated immediately on a Sunday night (half off wine night!!) around 9pm. This restaurant is highly professional and our waiter was the poster boy for professional service. \n\nWe were brought rolls followed by some foie gras. The wine started flowing and our apps arrived. My boss got Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp, and it was incredible. 5 Shrimp... this thing was an entree! I got a Crawdad Risotto, and not only was it an entree itself  it was so incredibly rich and flavorful that I could have ordered it again and called it a night. \n\nThe special of the house that night was the short ribs and my boss got that... I am not a fan of short ribs, but apparently they were wonderful. I got the Creole Grilled Center Cut New York Strip. I usually never order steak at a restaurant, but this was just perfect and cooked medium just to my liking. I couldn't even eat half of it though because of the giant apps, but it was excellent.  \n\nFortunately, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, we got the Prix-Fixe style meal so we HAD to get dessert. This is where Rosemary's sealed the deal for me. Three words: Goat Cheese Cheesecake. I can never eat mere COW Cheesecake again. I would consider driving back to Vegas just to eat this dessert again. My boss got some Chocolate Bread Pudding or something... GOAT CHEESE CHEESECAKE PEOPLE!  \n\nOverall this place is one of the best ever. Perfect mix of high class and casual candor, impeccable service, and extraordinary food. Take a cab, hitch a ride, or run to Rosemary's from the Strip, and you will NOT be disappointed."
0,"wow, you get what you pay for. aside from the face that bally's is connected, this place seemed decent. They have that mon ami place to watch the fountains after all. The buffett was down right nasty and gave me the bubble guts midway through - had to leave before getting my $15. \nNow, maybe this place wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't eaten at real buffets in LV and Hawaii, but this place was unacceptable. Nasty instant eggs (watery & rubbery), cool whip cream (not fresh whip cream), wholesale OJ (not fresh squeeze), no baked goodies, undercooked crepes, and no-refills even though we were sitting practically in the walkway. \n\nDon't be fooled by places that have lines and especially if you don't see any heavyweights parked out. In the future, I will request to scope out the scene before I pay for another buffet. they are just so hit and miss unless you have the presence of mind to check yelp first."
3,Love this place! They have the best Reuben sandwich around town. I always get mine on sourdough and a side of extra thousand Island. At $15 it is well worth the price and a great treat.  Make sure to get it with pastrami as this is the best cut of meat that is so tender juicy and flavorful and completes the Ruben.
0,"This place is terrible with the blandest of the bland pad thai. My husband and I checked out the place since we work and live in downtown and were looking for a good neighborhood restaurant. When we walked in, we should have been clued in immediately when we noticed the entire place was empty and it was during prime lunch hours.  Our suspicions were confirmed when two platefuls of pale looking noodles with nothing else but pale looking noodles stared back at our disappointed pale noodle hating faces. Never again, peddlers of bland noodles. How you stay in business is as much as a mystery as the Bermuda triangles."
2,"just returned from my stay this weekend. i thought the hotel was very unorganized. i got locked out of my room 'cause the the night lock/ hatch got stuck on the door without anyone being in the room. i called the front desk all day to get my luggage out of my room which had to be done asap since they gave me the wrong rooms the night before (i booked 2) and i had to switch rooms. they didn't understand what the problem was with the hatch and assumed i couldn't get in my room 'cause i already approved the room switch however the key still worked but the hatch was obviously not letting the door open all the way. even room service employee was trying to figure out what was up with my room door and how the the hatch was on. she said i should call the front desk 'cause she had to clean it. when i finally got through to the front desk for some reason instead of sending maintenance they sent security. finally i saw a maintenance man walking the hallway and told him the problem and he fixed it in seconds. even checked the room and said it was probably haunted. and the room switches, i waited all day for them. they kept saying theyll be ready in an hour, then half an hour, then half an hour later they would be ready in another half hour. i basically just wasted my whole friday on room switches and waiting for someone to fix my room door so i can collect my stuff. it was kinda disappointing because i've stayed here before and really liked my experience. don't think ill return to this hotel. i have had way better experiences at other mlife hotels. \n\nThe rooms were clean and there was a lot to do within the casino during my stay. in addition, my previous experience was really good which is why i decided to give 3 stars. I don't know why I was having so much bad luck this time around."
0,"I didn't wanna write a review but since 2 days late ,still feeling bad from the clam pizza....I'd have to say this place is no good."
4,"I would give this place more than five stars, if possible.\nWe found this place nestled right off of a main street on a cobble street road.\n\nThe atmosphere was cool and the selection of drinks was quite expansive. They had a good selection of every kind of alcohol, beer, wine and pitchers of mixed cocktails. The Pimms and Lemonade was really good.\n\nThe people behind the bar were extremely nice and chill. It was easy getting along with anyone behind the bar. I think that made us keep going back. \n\nIf I am ever in Edinburgh again, I will frequenting this spot again.\n\nThanks for a good time!"
3,"A group of girls and I had free bottle service through a promoter, but I'll try to review it objectively and not let the free vodka taint my opinion. \n\nWhen I first walked in, I hated it. It was all wood - wood paneling, wood floors, and had this weird \""fake\"" neighborhood bar type feel to it. It didn't feel exclusive, or like a club at all. THEN I started to fall in love with it. It has a totally different vibe than Tryst or Jet or Pure. It felt laid back, it felt unpretentious, it felt more casual. \n\nOur bottle service was great, but I probably wouldn't get bottle service here on my own dime. I think Wasted Space being sort of \""anti\"" club sort of makes the bottle service silly. I'd come here when I want to feel relaxed and blend in and just dance. Not when I'm wanting to feel special or \""exclusive\"". \n\nMusic was good. I liked all the rock music, but I was irritated that several songs they played for 20 seconds or less. The crowd was a bit more \""punk\"" than other clubs - more mohawks, more t-shirts. Not as much Ed Hardy, thank goodness! It seemed everyone was just relaxing and enjoying the music - it didn't seem as though there were as many people trying to be \""cool\"". \n\nLoved the Gogo dancers. They were HOT and totally sweet. One of them yelled to our group of girls and had us pass her our camera so we could get a really cool group shot. \n\nI for one actually really liked the Co-Ed bathrooms. The janitor/attendant dude wiped down the stall everytime a dude used it before a chick. I didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes (I've waited 20+ at Tryst before), and if you're so inclined.. the bathroom line could prove to be a great flirting opportunity. \n\nOverall I'd definitely go back. I loved the casual bar meets club vibe and the chill crowd."
3,I raised my rating to four stars due to I returned for lunch today. The restaurant is close to where our conference was being held and was squeezed on time. I tried the lunch special - a bowl of curry on rice and a bowl of pork ramen with miso broth. Food tasted better today and was less salty.(Maybe because I drank last night?) The portion of ramen was still quite large and curry was very tasty for a bargain price of $12.95 including tip.
0,"I won't speak for the whole company, but I will tell this branch is undertrained very unfriendly and makes no apologies for it."
1,"I had high hopes when I saw an Asian fusion food truck on the ASU campus, but I was very disappointed with my first experience. I ordered the K-Pop tacos, since putting Asian fillings inside a taco was one of the best ideas anyone (i.e. Kogi in LA) has ever had. The filling at Fan Boy was quite good: marinated chicken in a Gochujang style sauce, green onions, sesame seeds and kimchee. Unfortunately, the filling was served in the worst stale, cold, dry, nasty corn tortillas I've had the displeasure of eating in a long time. They were complete garbage. Whoever thought it would be acceptable to serve tacos on that crap should be fired. Like serving a sandwich on stale bread, it doesn't matter how good the filling is. A bad tortilla ruins a taco. The filling was promising enough that I will still try Fan Boy again. Once. If the next dish has another huge flaw, I'm done with them."
2,"Good place to go to is your looking for a casual, fun night out while stumbling back to you hotel."
3,Great drink selection. The queso dip and nachos make it worth the trip.
4,"5 Stars! Not cause its a super duper fine dining place... but because it was great in food and experience. Yeah sure it's nothing to go Ape over, but I got everything I expected from this kind of place. Had some oyster shooters. Yum. Louisiana oysters... YUM YUM.\n\nOne thing I DO have to say is, they had the BEST snow crab I've ever had. The texture was good. Not mushy or cakey. Not super salty or watered down like the stuff you might find at buffets. And it had an awesome sweetness to it. I enjoyed it more than the lobster. And I love lobster over crab!\n\nGreat food. Check.\nGood drinks... check...\n...totally worth what you pay for.\n\nI left the place like a fatty.\n\nIf you don't want crawfish but have a seafood craving.. go here.\n\nIt might not satisfy everyone... but this place now tops Hot & Juicy and Boiling Crab for me!"
3,"One of my all time favorite places to eat.  I don't get in here nearly often enough, but that is probably best, if I want to keep wearing the same sized pants.\n\nI am a huge fan of the \""Standard Classic Burger\"" here.  It is fresh simplicity, at it's best.  A hot, greasy burger on a fresh bun and tons of good fixings.....I go back here again and again.  Pair this up with a \""grocery basket\"" of mixed fries (regular & sweet potato), and you've got yourself a great meal.  I always order extra sides of their \""fresh aioli\"" sauce, which ultimately finds itself all over my burger, as well as my fries.\n\nA quick note on their signature \""delux burger\""....very good and I love that it's served on a demi-bagette, but the maytag and gruyere cheeses are just a bit much for me.  I'm not a big blue cheese guy, and I think it just overpowers the burger.  But, if strong cheese is your thing, order away....they don't call it the \""delux burger\"" for nothing!\n\nOne last comment that you may not know about delux......they serve until 2:00 AM.  So, after a night of power drinking, divert your taxi to Camelback & 32nd Street for the ultimate anti-hangover gut bomb.  Expect to wait for a seat.  I've found the wait at 1:30 AM is as long, if not longer, than it is during lunch!"
3,Hard to believe this place is right down the  strip from treasure island. Great Thai food and really cheap prices.Be prepared to wait around lunch or dinner times as the place is small. Must try..
2,I bought a travel zoo voucher for Cravings at the Mirage and so glad I did.  The quantity of choices are slim - compared to other buffets around town but the quality of food was very good.  The only thing I didn't really care for was the desserts.  I felt it could have been better.
2,"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. \n\nThis place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....\n\nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \n\nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \""Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\"" Pretty much always my thought process. \n\nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. \n\nThanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!"
3,a cozy breakfast spot similar to dennys or kings minus the shit your pants feeling you get from dennys or kings.  ive only eaten breakfast here cant speak on the other foods but if you can make a bomb breakfast lunch and dinner should be similar.
1,Meat and two place. Pretty decent food. Great service. Divey.
4,"Excellent!  Love this place. My former \""go-to\"" place was La Scala.  However if you want a special meal, try Ferraro's.\n\na. Location - On the NE corner of Harmon and Paradise, this place is easily accessible to all areas of Las Vegas.  Plenty of parking and although in a strip mall, very well placed to streets and the freeway.\n\nb.  Ambiance - This is a fairly large place that has some private areas, some normal areas, a bar area. I think it will be able to handle groups of all sizes!  Comfortable, roomy and elegant yet casual.\n\nc.  Service - This is one reason I come back. I bring my friends from Middle East and Europe here and they really love it. We usually ask for Alessandro to wait on us and we don't use the menu. WE just describe to him what experience we are looking for, and he and the chef bring stuff out for us. It is great.  Friendly, professional and very attentive.\n\nd.  Food - As you know, we just yap and the waiter and chef bring stuff out. Antipasto, sharing three types of pasta on a tasting plate, a bit of meat, small bits of dessert.  It does not get better than this!  Love it and everyone that comes here enjoys it as well.\n\ne.  Price - A tad bit more expensive, because we are trying lots of stuff.  Usually ends up about 50.00 per person without alcohol. OK, so at Olive Garden you may spend about 25.00 per person, however, the price is relative. This place is unique,and the pasta's are great. The last time we had lobster ravioli, gnocchi, and risotto. We had antipasto, calamari, then we had osso buco and a bit of cannoli and tiramisu. \n\nI love coming here and will continue as the food and service are great."
3,"Unique dining for sure. NOT a fancy place, not a date place. But awesome options.... First of all, where else can you order kool-aid????\n\nAlso, The mac and cheese side is amazing. I ordered the Betty Boop- a chicken breast and waffle, and added to it a side of the mac and cheese. Everything tastes exactly how i dreamnt it would. Fattening and hearty!\n\nTake home a slice of the red velvet cake.... the best I have ever had anywhere hands down."
1,"If the room had been cleaned properly, this hotel would have easily earned another star. I would consider staying here again, but if the room is not clean I will take the time to complain and get some of my money back. I added some photos I took of our room at this hotel that might get taken down so let me describe them for you: One photo was of the carpet in between our bed and the nightstand, which was dirty and some of the debris included a glowstick (how do you miss that?) and a pretzel. If you don't clean up food it attracts bugs! Which leads us to the second picture, which was of the top of the nightstand and some disembodied insect parts i found there. Mostly legs. It was gross. Also there was a long hair dangling from the lampshade by the bed. CLEAN your hotel rooms! This hotel would be great if they hired a competent housekeeping staff. Location was nice and the amenities were just fine, but for the state the room was in I would say that I definitely overpaid."
3,"Pros: Great location. Nice rooms. Cheap price. \n\nCons: Cheesy theme, dated exterior. \n\nBest value on the trip if you can get past the fact that the outside is a little dated and the theme. The room we stayed in was on the top floor and looked as if it had been newly renovated. We paid $109/night. The only hotel near that price was the Stratosphere. I prefer this hotel to the MGM grand and NYNY. Breakfast restaurant was good, but I would have liked to have seen a fast food option or two."
1,"I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl. This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell. That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster."
0,"Staying at Mirage so we decided to check this place out.  Great looking atmosphere, good menu but the hostess was ice cold.  Asked a question about the menu and was ignored.  The girl acted like she couldn't be bothered.  Wtf?  You're a hostess. Seriously.  So we moved on to Stack and had a great time. Asked around and a lot of people had the same experience.  Big fan of Top Chef and Tom Collochio but so disappointed in the cold reception.  I guess they're too cool for me so I'll take my money elsewhere."
2,If I had the choice I would have definietely stayed somewhere else. but it was free and the fact that we didn't spend much time in the rooms I guess it didn't really matter.  \n\nThe pool is the plus side of the stay.  Pretty big area but was always packed 1st thing in the morning but would die down by afternoon. \nYes they have the topless area but did not care to check the area out seein the people who actually walked into the place were def. not ppl you would want to see topless. SLide there was cool.\n\nThe casinos were always so LIVELY. No matter what time it was it was always poppin! \n\nI definitely liked staying at MGM or Luxor more. I think this was more of a family kinda place.
2,"I tried the 3 tacos for $6 deal and ordered a soda in the can.  Ordering was easy enough and I got my food pretty fast out the back window.  I might not have known about the rear delivery system if I had not already wondered by it earlier.\n\nI received my tacos, but my soda was missing when they called my name.  I mentioned it to very friendly lady that delivered my food and she promptly got it for me.\n\nI ordered a green meat, a red meat and a chicken taco.  All three tacos came individually wrapped in foil and came in a brown paper bag.  It also came with both green and red sauces.  All three came with soft flour tortilla wrappings. I am not a fan of flour tortillas for tacos because I usually prefer the street style with corn tortillas.  The tables also had El Pato Sauce and another hot sauce for your pleasure, although I am not sure they keep them refrigerated?\n\nThe flavor, temperature, and the taste of the meat tacos were fine.  I was surprised to find beans in all 3 tacos, but they added nice texture and flavor.\n\nThe green and red meat tacos were pretty good, but did not stand out as something that I would crave on a Saturday night after a few brews.  The chicken taco had huge cubes of white chicken meat.  The chicken drowned out the other flavors in the taco (actually too much chicken).\n\nOverall, a pretty cool eclectic place that I would try again."
0,"I am a huge fan of the Chipotle brand and food. This negative review is for the service I received this afternoon at this location.\n\nEarliest pickup time available when we submitted our online order was 1:15pm. We arrived 15 minutes early, was told that our order was not ready and would be about 10 minutes. We tried to pay when there wasn't a line of customers and were told that we could not pay until our order was fulfilled. The girl in charge of the pickup orders came out and told us it would be another 10 minutes. She came out with our order at 1:15pm on the dot, and told us in an exasperated tone to call next time if we would be arriving early. Her attitude was terrible, as if we were a HUGE inconvenience and had rushed her (which, obviously, we hadn't since our order came out right on time...). A simple, \""Sorry for the wait, I was backed up on other orders and couldn't get this out earlier for you\"" would've sufficed. \n\nWhat's even BETTER is that when we mentioned pick-up-girl's attitude, the manager followed up with the same answer, \""next time call ahead if you'll be arriving early\"" without so much as a hint of apology. Clearly WE were in the wrong here. It was definitely a missed opportunity on the manager's part to turn the situation around and save our experience from being so disappointing. Coming from a background in retail and fast food, I was baffled by their self-righteous, unapologetic attitudes.\n\nI also didn't understand why 1. the manager was working in the fulfillment line the whole time and 2. there were periods of time when there were no customers to help - whey didn't someone (like, ahem, the manager) go and help the girl filling pickup orders?\n\nI've never had a bad experience at Chipotle before today, and will definitely never come back to this location."
4,"The service is exceptional. There was a South American teppan chef that was very nice and generous. I had the calamari and it was sooo fresh and tasty. He gave us nice shrimp appetizer that I was surprised came with. The teppan is unique because they serve noodles. The rice came last after the food, which was nice because I hate filling up on rice before the main entree. But, the rice is definitely the best part of a teppan experience. I got too full by the time the rice came out and felt guilty not even touching it.\n\nWe went during happy hour and everything was reasonably priced. I ordered a shrimp tempura sushi and it cost $7, but it was a large well presented roll that tasted fresh and perfect. We were tempted to go for the all you can eat, but we held that off as Ricky wanted the happy hour teppan. It ended up costing us less. We are on a budget so we needed to by mindful of what we ordered even if we were treating ourselves. \n\nAll in all I would definitely come back."
3,"Loved this place!\nI ordered the Italian Chopped Salad and Red Sangria and both were absolutely delicious.  The sangria may have been the best red sangria I ever had and there was nothing to complain about with the salad.\nI bought some olive oil cupcakes to take home.  While I wouldn't rave about them, there wasn't anything to really complain about either.  The oiliness of the cupcakes was welcomed by me but overall texture and flavor I wouldn't say was the best ever.\nI'm looking forward to returning here to try more of their menu items as well as to purchase some of the goods in their store."
4,"I can't say enough good things about this vet! I used to go to another vet out in Gilbert, but needed to find a closer vet when I moved to Queen Creek. I did a ton of research because I've heard many bad things about some of the vets out here and I found Animal House through that research. They have been amazing with both of my dogs. Both vets have been the most caring, loving vets I have ever met. Dr. Anderson has frequently offered lower cost options for treatment instead of just suggesting the most expensive thing out there. She even offered a follow up visit for free after treating my over active dog for tearing his nail off. My only complaint is that the last time I was in I spent a ton of money on allergy medication and was told later by friends that other vets have suggested to use Benedryl instead of paying exponentially more for the prescription. But, I don't know if they have good reasons for that and I didn't ask so take that opinion with a grain of salt. Love them anyway and will continue to use them over and over again!"
1,"Overpriced just \""okay\"" italian food.  My dinner included overcooked (mushy) pasta and overcooked shrimp...husbands chicken had gross fat and chewy sections.  Not worth the $50 price tag...should have ate at a local joint."
2,"If you're looking for a quick but good sandwich or salad, then this is the place. A little pricier than other downtown options, but worth it for the better quality. The staff seemed nice though I only talk with them for a couple of minutes (probably 2 min more than most customers). Newly opened, so ambience is a little spartan. Grab something and head out again, don't plan on eating there."
1,"Decided to check this place out since we were in the area and there was a yelp deal. \n\nThe food was decent, nothing too special but it took forever for the server to bring our food and it wasn't hot when it arrived. After waiting forever we didnt' want to send it back to be reheated. The restaurant wasn't that busy either so the delay and luke warm food was a disappointment."
2,"OMG the steaks are huge! I dont eat red meat  but everyone else that ate it said it was good and juicy. We had a fixed meal off the menu b/c it was for a wedding reception. Starters were some crab soup, which i wasn't to fond of and caesar salad. The crab cakes are good. I had the fish and it was kind of dry and over cooked also pretty bland. Dessert was a coco truffle bar that was pretty good. Service was good."
0,"Decided to give this place a try....First, let me say the bartenders could use a bit more personality.  With that said, we ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich and was told it was big enough for 2.  Well, yes it was, but was no larger than a large Subway.  the sauce was acidy and very spicy. Not hot spicy, but spicy.  SALTY as well.  The salad that came with it would have been much better with just a simple oil and vinegar dressing with pepper and salt.  The dressing was piled on it, making the lettuce soggy.  I think it was comprised of some sort of soured cream and lemon mixture. and SALT once again.  We each had one glass of wine and the bill was a staggering 46.00 with tip.  I could have gone to Russo's for a much better sandwich, for a lot less. Nope, won't be going back.  Too many other better places here in Vegas, on and off strip."
0,"Dead empty on a Thursday during happy hour before the Steelers game.  Just a couple guys playing video games.  Sign outside mentions $1 miller lites on Thursdays.  Except we found out that wasn't until 9pm.  And happy hour didn't start until 5:30 so until then Miller Lites were $6.  The bar looked nice inside but the bartender couldn't be bothered.  No thanks, 1 miller lite and left."
1,"Arrived at 2pm on a Saturday- a busy time no doubt but we'd been here before and enjoy the food. We were told they were out of brisket. After waiting in line about 35 minutes we placed our order- 5 two-meat combos- all pulled chicken and tri-tip. Once we got to the counter for them to fill our order they then told us they were out of tri-tip and that it'd be a few minutes for the next batch to be done. They put our ticket aside as we waited. Tri-tip was done- but then they proceeded to fill singleton orders that came in behind ours, forgetting about our order. So now- no more tri-tip... again. Then they said brisket would be ready in a few minutes- we waited. After another LONG 45 minute wait, we were once again told that they were now out of brisket. Are you SERIOUS? I sighed and the man (\""Slick\"" they call him) behind the counter could sense my frustration. He began to try to make light of the situation saying things like \""aww don't get mad Erin.\"" (Your name is on your ticket order) And proceeds to turn to the others behind the counter saying, \""we done made Erin mad.\"" I don't know about you- but after an HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTE WAIT- you're right. I'm mad. And chastising your PAYING customers for your mistakes isn't the way to earn my business or my money. We asked for our $87 dollar refund and got the hell out of there. We won't be back."
0,Bleh.  This place isn't even good when you are drunk.
1,"Finally made it out to Twin Peaks. It's got a Mancave type layout, plenty of TV's and good looking waitresses. It was packed during the after-work rush and the ladies were hustling. Service was excellent but the food was disappointing. Obviously, no one comes here for the food but with so many dining options near the Biltmore, its a waste to try any food here. We had the sliders, chicken fingers and Cobb Salad. (All were sub-par)   \n\nTilted Kilt is miles ahead of Twin Peaks with better atmosphere and food. I'd even say Hooters is superior. I'm not a fan of the Cold Beer gimmick or Shot-skis but maybe I'm just getting old. Who's down for Sizzler, next time?"
3,"Secret gem hidden in a residential neighborhood. Interior is clean and inviting. Seating is pretty limited so expect to wait if you arrive during peak hours. Great Steak & Eggs or Steak sandwhich for $5.99, but it doesn't taste like it was $5.99. Service is always tops and you know a place is good when servers know customers by name. My parents love this place so much they sometimes go 5 plus times a week. Nothing on the menu is breathtaking just your normal family restaurant food. Great prices, fantastic specials, and consistently good services. In a town like Vegas you can't beat that."
0,"We visited the bar after a badger football game. It was PACKED! We could barely move. They had several bar tenders behind the bar but most of them seemed ill equipped to deal with the extreme number of customers. They overpoured, and some were flat out rude. I actually watched a bartender tell another guest that she was, \""not very happy with them\"" and \""I'm done with you after this\"" when he requested another drink. While I fully understand that they were busy, I felt this was extremely unprofessional. When we finally got someone to get us drinks it took him approximately 4 minutes to pour two glasses of wine! He was clearly untrained and had no idea what he was doing. He struggled to open the wine bottle.  We also ordered a bloody mary, as they looked amazing. Mine was served with a dead bug on the celery, a real dead bug, not a halloween decoaration. Disgusted but not wanting to wait for a new drink, I just removed the celery from my glass. Upon drinking it, it was really strong and also tasted like the juice was rotten. I took another sip and then tossed it. \n\nWhile I'm sure that hotel itself is lovely, they really do need to focus on their bar. I will not be back."
4,"A new benchmark has been set for pubs in Las Vegas. \n\nIn my initial review, I praised the amazing service and exceptionally friendly atmosphere of this hidden little gem on the western edge of town, but I also mentioned that the food was nothing to get excited about.\n\nWell that has all changed with Sagos new menu. I have two words - GREAT JOB!\n\nMoving the menu closer to the restaurants Baja theme, management has introduced a completely new menu filled with some great selections like fish and shrimp tacos, homemade pizza, a delicious chicken avocado sandwich, a new twist on the BLT with a tomato jelly that rocks and much more.\n\nIf you go, and you will, you have to try the Ceviche - cradled in what looked like a sea-shell shaped crisp flour tortilla, the taste is fabulous and the serving size to price ratio will fill you up but still make you want to order another.\n\nWay to go Sagos, you guys have hit all the marks now - great food, great service, great atmosphere. I'll be there - soon."
2,"The wife and I had a pleasant dinner at Pinot during a recent stay at the Venetian.\n\nWe started by splitting an endive salad... they literally split it onto two plates, which was a nice touch, but the two halves were so small as to be almost comical.\n\nMy wife had the lobster for her main, and it was really perfect. She did her best to extract every morsel while remaining as ladylike as possible.\n\nMy entree was duck breast, and it was fairly good, but there was a thin vein of gristle that kept it from being among the best I'd ever had.\n\nWe ended up skipping dessert because of the richness of our entrees, but we did have a couple of nice glasses of wine. I've since forgotten the producer, but mine was a delicious Washington Pinot Noir, while my wife had champagne.\n\nOur server was very nice and patient with us, which is always appreciated.\n\nWe really like the atmosphere at Pinot--it is elegant without being stuffy.\n\nDon't expect to be blown away by the food or the value (this is Vegas, after all), but if you're staying at the Venetian, Pinot Brasserie is a suitable spot for a romantic dinner for two."
0,"I tried Kuma the first time and it tasted like plastic, I got the mango flavor with mango and condensed milk. I decided to give it another try since my friends were going there and I got the same thing since I love mango. It still taste really bad, it was really flakey and not what I expected. The taste was almost like shaved ice with no flavor. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The taste is really bad and the fruits were so bitter. The seats are very limited as well so you either have to eat in your car or stand up and eat."
1,"I've heard rave reviews about this place from my friends but thinking about it now it's probably because they were DRUNK while eating it!  Waited 20 minutes to get our food (and we were the only ones in line) then after we ordered a friend of the truck owners got there ordered and got her food first!  No good...  after the 20 minute wait we thought the food was going to be worth the wait but NOOOO!!! Our burgers were raw!  Not rare, just bloody and gross.  Never going there again!"
1,"Sadly, I have to give a 2-star review to 5-star tasting pizza because the owner is rude and has no customer service skills at all! I am so angry that a place that serves such delicious pizza is run by a man with a nasty attitude that does not know how to appreciate his customers. \n\nA word to the wise for the owner: Have your wife or son take care of the front of house and please stay in the back, away from customers. You are going to end up out of business and it will be your own fault. The pizza is hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten but I would rather gag down some frozen pizza than to be treated like garbage by someone who is making money off of me. Without us (your customers) you do not have a business! Remember that and adjust your attitude accordingly or you will be out of business and flipping burgers in short order!"
4,"I ordered chocolate shaved snow and it wasn't what I was expecting, but good. Employees were super friendly and the store was spotless, even on a busy Saturday evening. Fun addition to Centennial Hills"
4,"This past weekend, I squealed in delight to learn about the Simply 500 menu that Zoes recently launched. Well, they didn't actually launch it since the items have always been on their menu, but they've finally made it easy on on the calorie-conscious to figure out what to order while visiting. Sadly the hummus wasn't on the menu (probably because of the pita), but there are several delicious items, including the spinach roll-ups! I uploaded the menu and posted it to the Yelp listing. Take a look! Your waistline will thank you."
4,We come here often! The food is excellent and fresh. We have great service and enjoy the ambiance. They have delicious salsa and you can ask for one a bit hotter and wow it's great! They also have great lemonade!!\n\nDuring the week they have very reasonable lunch specials!
1,"Checkout experience is very poor.  Never enough lanes open and I hate their policy of reading the customer's last name out loud when they give you the receipt.  My last name is no one's business!  Please stop doing this!  Major privacy violation!\n\nOn a positive note, the organic produce section is quite good and the only reason I shop here."
0,This seemingly is JUST for the home--not for people's clothes. I thought it was a JoAnn's competitor.\n\nBolts and bolts of fabric on hanging rolls. Also carpets. No one said hello or offered to help us. No patterns here. They have designer fabric but i didnt check the labels.
3,"Really like this place!  You aren't going to find a Speedy Gonzales on the menu, that's for sure.  Fresh, interesting food, friendly waitstaff and great outdoor seating on a nice night. \n\nThe chips and salsa are good (as I've mentioned, I judge a Mexican restaurant on their chips and salsa), the enchiladas are really nice (especially the corn/chicken, shrimp/crab and mushroom) and the sides are great.  The plantain black bean mash is my favorite followed very closely by the plantains.  \n\nThis place hits the list each time I'm staying in uptown Charlotte."
0,"Ok this store just got a big fat ZERO! how do you sell the same clothes in the same store and when you find one marked at $170 and the other on sale for $88 and not honor the lower price! Sorry don't except the excuse different department. You're the same fucking store and the store manager wouldn't do shit. Poor customer service, any other department store would except the fact they screwed up. \nDillard's you just choked the big one"
0,"This McDonalds has the worst service. We don't go to McDonalds often and the few times we have gone here they screw up your order. I did not check my order this morning and got home and sure enough a sandwich was missing. The other food also tasted like it was sitting under the warmer forever. \n\nI tried calling the store four times and no one picked up. I then called the customer service department to tell them about the poor service. I don't have high expectations when it comes to fast food, but at the minimum put the right food in the bag. \n\nThanks for making it easier to not go back :-)"
4,"The only bad thing about this place is that they only accept cash. Other than that this place is on my number 1 list for having the best burger I have ever eaten. To describe the burger I had was sooo juicy inside, the outside was chared crispy from the open flame, the bun was air fluffed soft and the cheese was very cheese. I would take a bite I can see the juices from the burger drip. Everytime I think of this place my mouth begins to water :-P"
1,"Upstream has gone downhill, fast. While the bar ambience and feel is still awesome, the sushi in particular was extremely lacking. Spicy Tuna rolls were not fresh and smelled like fish. California rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland. \n\nService was also not particularly good and there was a very creepy manager who put us off. \n\nIt is a shame because Upstream has been a staple of the South Park area for years, but their sushi quality is completely lacking these days. I cannot comment on the main courses as we did not have any."
3,"Man, I went there today and wow!  I personally loved this place...it reminded me of a few cafes back home in Dallas, Tx.  If you're looking for a good breakfast place...go to this place!!!  You won't regret it!!!  :)"
0,"Seriously, no idea how anyone could give a good review for this awful restaurant. Agreed on the nice setting. But the food is terrible. And really overpriced! It's always empty...for good reason. I make better fajitas than this place (and so does TGIF) but they charge $22 for them...and sour cream is extra. Food cannot be less authentic. No clue about Mexican food at all. Save yourself the bother."
2,"It's a PITA to get in if you're with all guys as they allow only 1:1 male:female ratio. This is great because women outnumber the guys, and there is nothing worse than going into a club and being surrounded by guys (unless that's your thing). It get extremely crowded even though there are 3 different areas of the club. Tao Beach has a great view. Overall a decent Vegas club."
2,"Its good food.  Its just not the greatest food for the price you pay.  I had a spicy chicken of some sort, and they dont mess around when it comes to the spicy stuff.  This stuff was HOT.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I just didnt feel like the food justified the price.  $11 for a lunch special?  No thanks.  I would give the food 4 out of 5 stars though."
3,Good guacamole and the carne asada was very tender. Good salsa.

2,"I travel quite often, always with the same airline so I have my routine pretty much down. I can see why a first timer would be confused or have a poor experience here the airport is HUGE. Be prepared to WALK especially if you are flying in. \n\nTons of places to eat even if you are not actually flying somewhere so whomever is dropping you off can park and go have a bite to eat with you. \n\nIf you're getting a rental good luck you have to take a shuttle to get to the rental port and it's usually busy so be prepared to wait a bit. \n\nIf you're flying in each and every time the bags take FOREVER to get the baggage claim port on average it's about a 10 minute wait BEFORE they announce that your bags are being loaded to whatever baggage claim port.. So once again be prepared to wait. Oh not to mention this is after about a 10 minute journey to the baggage claim area after you get off your flight."
3,"Great service, very friendly. Amazing beer list and great food.  Very relaxing atmosphere. Great place to get lunch and talk."
4,"One of Vegas' best restaurant. If you can get there for happy hour M-F even better price! Medium prices, not expensive by any stretch. Crab dip is excellent! Oysters Rockefeller is excellent! Peal and eat shrimp is a nice little side to snack on. Middle of the night craving? Try their soup only offered during the late night hours. Their beer is delicious, make sure to try it. My favorite is their raspberry beer however it's seasonal and there's always something new to try. \n\nRecommended Foods: Crab & Artichoke Dip, Ribs - the meat is so so tender it falls off the bone. Literally! Pizza is just okay, a take it or leave it dish, peel and eat shrimp, hamburgers, sandwiches, prime rib is good... portions are generous, more than enough! \n\n(Went back today, had the dip and ribs again... yummy! Parmigiana sandwich was not that good though the cream of corn soup was very good)"
1,"I am new to Yelp but trying to catch up on reviewing some my favorite places but also some not so favorites. Granted, I have only dined here one time for dinner but our experience was not very good. The service was pretty slow even though it was not that busy. The food was the main disappointment.  We went here because of the whole \""farm fresh\"" concept. Salads were expensive for the amount that was on the plate. Pork was pretty good but once again pretty high for what you get. I understand that they try to use local ingredients from farmers which usually result in higher food cost but when I got my bill, it left a bad taste."
0,"Service was extremely slow and not very useful...never once asked if we wanted something to drink, just brought water out. Took a hour for a 9\"" pizza that didn't even have all the correct toppings on it. Food was \""meh\""."
0,"I finally came around to eating here. I'm sorry PT, but not satisfied. I'd probably only come here again because we have no choice because we usually only come here for good-bye parties, so if you're coming here just for drinks, you'll be fine... (for the most part, besides the fact that they take about 20 min to bring you out your beer, and another 15 mins to get your check.) \n\nHowever, their food is not that great... We ordered a pepperoni pizza, it sucks. and definitely wasn't worth 20 bucks for a pizza. Call me cheap, but I happen to find pizza places like hungry howies or lil caesars WAY better than this. We were even there at happy hour and our bill was still 20 bucks for just a pizza. Unless the pizza was originally 40 bucks, then i guess i got the happy hour discount, but i'm sure it wasn't. But after as long as it took for us to get our check, I didn't want to deal with the waitress because i didn't want to be there all night. Pizza took over a half hour to get there, and another 45 mins to get our check. It wasn't even worth 20 bucks in any way. It was flavorless, plain, yuck. We couldn't eat all of it so we just started giving them away lol.\n\nThe same thing with our buddies. He advised us to not order thru a waitress and go to the bar because it took forever to get his pizza and beer, so when we went to the bar instead, they wouldn't take out order because we weren't \""technically\"" sitting at the bar. Way I look at it is... We were still in the bar area, so who gives a shit!?! so we had to order thru a waitress. No big deal... it ONLY took about 30 mins to find a waitress. geez, what does it take to get some service around this place? Fuck PTs. Thats all I have to say."
1,"Four of us went here on Friday night around 6:00pm. We told the host that we wanted to have a drink at the bar and then have dinner. He bluntly stated that we better keep an eye on the door because he wouldn't save a table for us. We didn't think it would be a problem, so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks. I enjoyed the Pomagranitini and the others had martinis. As we finished our drinks, I went up to the host and asked for a table. He asked for my name, smugly handed me a \""buzzer\"" and said that it would be 25-30 minutes. I noticed that my name was the only one on the list, I looked around and no one was waiting. It looked like there were some tables available so I was very puzzled. I went back to my friends and we agreed that we would rather spend our money next door at Firebirds where we have always been treated well. When my friend told the host, he just shrugged and said okay. I was very disappointed at the poor customer service we experienced. When I go to a restaurant, I want to feel like they want my business."
2,"The burger was good, the fries were ok, but once you mentally process that they were deep fried in lard, then what was tasting really good turned into a really guilt-loaded dinner. But it is what it says it is. A truly American restaurant, proud of its decadence."
1,"My husband and I came here right before seeing a movie. We chose it based on the fact it is right next to the movie theater. The staff was great, prompt with seating and taking our order. \nYummy watermelon margarita! The food...... Not so great. I got the chopped salad but couldn't eat more than two bites because the dressing was far too spicy. The waiter was nice enough to substitute my salad with a quesadilla, which was nothing great, but at least my mouth wasn't on fire. My husband got the rancho burrito which wasn't too bad. \nWhen we go back to the movies, we'll go somewhere else for dinner. I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone."
3,"This place is insane.  First off, the cover is a lot to get in there at $30 for girls and $50 for guys after waiting in line.\n\nDrinks are way over priced too, $8.75 for a beer, $15 for a cocktail.\n\nWith that said, the vibe, music, and atmosphere here is a great time.  Ran into some people that were in town for an Awards Show and had a blast.  Overall this place is fun, but dont go there if you're looking for something cheap to do."
4,"It always nice to be one of the firsts to see a new restaurant, nightclub, bar, etc.  Especially because the service is typically great, everything is shiny & new.  And the enthusiasm of many familiar faces is felt from the moment you walk in.   RnR Scottsdale's opening night was no different than previously stated.  \n\nThere was a much smaller food menu available, but they are Ready-N-Rolling (Rock-n-Roll, Rest-N-Relaxation, pick one or make up your own definition).  I had the new IPA by New Belgium (Fat Tire), Ranger.  Clean, smooth, not too hoppy.  The setting is comfortable and warm (heating on both upper and lower patios), TV's galore, great location on Scottsdale Road near RA and the Billet Bar.\n\nThere are a number of great names associated with this new endeavor and it shows.  They created a great vibe that will undoubtedly be the next contender for \""The Place\"" to be.  Beginning this Saturday morning, they will roll out breakfast for the first time.  The menu, hours of operation and location make this a home-run in my book.  (had to throw that in for all the spring training fans that will be in the area.)"
3,"Where else can you catch a sporting event or concert for less than $20?  With lots of parking and reasonably priced food and drinks, this is the place to be to watch all your favorite artists that are not headliners on the strip.  I just recently watched the SWV and Joe concert... it was well worth it."
3,"I have never stayed at a Towmplace Suites before and since the week I stayed in Tempe was Spring Break it was a tad bit difficult to book a hotel room.  This was the only hotel that had a room available even with my Marriott status.  It is a smaller version of the Residence Inn with a small kitchen.  I am not complaining at all, the front desk person was the most helpful though giving me directions to the nearest Whole Foods market etc. and because of my Platinum status with Marriott she gave me free items in the Marketplace, much appreciated.  So. with that said, it is a good option if you are a business traveler and if you are traveling to a busy city with limited hotel rooms available."
1,"*I am not a vegetarian. \nMy usual Thai restaurant was closed so we've decided to try another place out.\n\nOrdered chicken pad thai and a pineapple fried rice.\n\nNoodle for pad thai was undercooked, it was too chewy and some part was hard. \nThey did not ask us for the level of spiciness, just gave us a very sweet pad thai. It was too sweet for me, because I usually have spicy pad thai.\nOther than that it was okay.\n\nFor the pineapple fried rice, it just tasted like catchup. \nSome might like it, but not for me. I am used to other restaurants' pineapple fried rice which does not taste like catchup at all.\nFor me it was horrible. \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is outdated. Looks like a local family owned restaurant.  Nothing below or above that. Which I do not mind anyway.\n\nOverall, I would describe the food as...food I get to eat when I go over friend's house. Not extremely good and not awfully bad, but just little different taste than what I usually have. Different style.\n\nDefinitely a homemade food taste. If you get what I mean."
3,I have been here a few times. I think this place is definitely better than the other common Mexican family chain taco places. I had the shrimp burrito. At first I was kinda iffy ordering shrimp. In the end it was worth the risk. It was the perfect amount of spiciness where it makes you sweat a little but you cant stop eating it. My friends dad got the mole chicken and he swears it was just as good as his ex wife's. I know of several other people that live in the area that also rave about this place. They have dinning tables but its more of a order your food to go place. They cook the food fresh so it will still be piping hot when you get home.
1,"This buffet was great when it first opened, but has now fell off a bit over the past couple of months.  I also believe the price has gone up, yet the food quality has gone down.  Tourists might enjoy this buffet, but being a local...I will have to pass."
3,"The sushi was excellent, and the fish was very, very fresh, with wonderful texture and taste.  I graded Sushi Twister down a star because the rice kept falling apart (in both nigiri and rolls), and the Yellow Mango wiz Shrimp roll did not have much flavor.  Everything else was outstanding in taste, particularly the Vacation Roll.  \n\nIt's a new favorite sushi spot for us, and we won't hesitate to return."
3,"I remember when I first heard of the Lion King stage show I thought 'hmm, thats kind of cheesy' and then more and more friends would tell 'omg, its an incredible show, you have to check it out!.  Once again I thought 'um...really?  I can't picture it...'  And for some reason none of the promo still shots really wow'ed me either.\n\nOk so cut to early this year on a previous trip to Vegas, I decided to catch the show w a friend after multiple recommendations and all I can say is\n\n'Wow, what a fantastic stage production and fun show to boot.'  They capture all the raw emotion and tear jerking moments of the animated film, and do a wonderful visual translation that is graceful, beautiful, and funny, at the same time.\n\nThe theater in in the Mandalay Bay is great and I had seats in the main floor section about 20 rows back from the stage, and way off to the side, yet I could see all of the show without any problem.  I don't think there are any bad views in the house.  Plus the show is a fully immersive experience as dancers, actors and singers will pop out from all sides of the theater, not just restrict themselves to the stage.  I'm not sure if this is just a Vegas thing or they do this in the other stage shows as well, but it definitely has a Cirque du Soleil feel to it.\n\nThey use multiple techniques to capture the look of the animated animals of the African plains and all of them are ingenious and creative, down to the purely symbolic sylized costumes of the Lion characters with their cool retractable masks that don't hinder choreography & dance, to the fully translated cartoony full outfits of Timon & Poomba and the Hyenas, to what has to be my favorite, the stunt stilt walkers in their FULL SCALE giraffe outfits, you have to see how they do it to understand, it's amazing to see.\n\nStory and musical score is essentially the same, but with the Mandrill baboon character being elevated to one of the star cast members taking the place of some of the background vocals and narrator.  The actress who portrayed her (they changed from male to female) is simply amazing and the actors who played adult Simba, Simba's father and Scar are great as well.  \n\nYou have to see this show if you loved the movie, and even if you haven't go see it anyway!  It'll probably inspire you to go rent the movie even if you don't have any kids."
2,"I have given this place a second-chance.\n\nI rate this restaurant 3 stars (A-OK) because of consistency of quality and consistency of delivery and appropriate price.\n\nIt isn't so bad if you do NOT have high expectations of a barbecue place. Plus, any place that lifts a finger to serve Fried Okra is A-OK in my book!\n\nFootnote: Pickles in a 5-gallon barrel, self-serve fountain drinks and barbecue sauce, and (hilariously) self-serve soft-serve ice creamsortofstuff. A-OK."
1,"We parked here and validated the ticket ourselves at the machine by the cashiers. When we left, we were told that parking was $3 and the validation was only for 3 hours. What? Boo.\n\nI got propositioned by a weird tattoo shop owner outside the bathrooms. He had some silicon implants shaped like stars in his forehead. Weird.\n\nWe were gonna go to this \""College Night\"" at the Canyon Club since one of our friends didn't have an ID and it was 18+ but they were charging a $10 cover. What the HECK? For underage people? What a rip-off, man. We just left."
4,"The Tumble Inn is a no-frills sports bar on the edge of downtown Champaign - they have a bunch of TVs, a lot of domestics on tap, and there's usually a barbecue truck parked out front. I have been here on several occasions at off-peak times to watch sporting events, and each time has been thoroughly enjoyable."
3,Genny's is a hoot! I'm def Straight but NOT narrow.
1,"Chicken kabobs were tasty, however the spinach wraps clearly tasted of freezer funk, so I ordered the orzo soup and hummus instead. The hummus was great but my soup had about three grains of orzo in it!! Won't be coming back."
3,"Average taste, huge portions"
0,"I used to love this place. When it first opened (when it was half the size it was now, and they had BYOB because they didn't have an alcohol license), we really enjoyed it. The servers were friendly and fast, and the manager walked around and checked on all her guests.\n\nWhat the heck happened? This was my go-to spot during weekdays around lunch, when me and the girls would go in for their lunch special (a salad and pasta or pizza for $9). Slowly, this place was going from one of my favorite places, to somewhere I would avoid. There is no reason to have rude, ignorant waiters who know nothing about the new items they've added to their menu, or how to use a register. \n\nDespite this, because it's so close, me and a couple friends went in to get the lunch special. We were seated immediately in a cool area under an air vent (thank God) and our drink orders were taken as a server (a young blonde girl) introduced herself. It took six minutes for our drinks to get to the table, while we watched her chatting with a guy at the bar.\n\nWhen we took our orders, I got my usual. I love their Spring salad, I always get it every time I come in, because it's always delicious - and the pasta martini, which my whole family enjoys when we come in. Our food came out quick, and our bill came out shortly.\n\nHowver, when we had asked for a split bill, she must have forgotten. We had all gotten the same thing (the lunch special and a soda) so we gave her our debit cards so she could split them up at the register. She brought back our bills to sign and return our cards when I noticed my bill said $17?! Umm, no?! I immediately corrected her, and she told me she would remove that from my card and replace it with my bill. I left a small tip and left.\n\nThe next day, I went on to check my bank account. Not ONLY had I been charged the 17 for someone else's order, but the additional 13.50 from mine!!!  THIRTY DOLLARS?! I called the manager and she asked for my reciept. When I explained I did not have it (she hadn't brought me one), she told me she could not help me, even though I offered to print out my bank statement. \n\nI doubt I will ever come back to this location. I much prefer the location in uptown, where the servers are friendly and out of high school."
2,"I've passed The Newsroom so many times but didn't actually venture in until last week. I was drawn in by a lot of hullaballo going on with people dressed up and handing out flyers for various Fringe shows.\n\nFeeling a little parched, we decided to pop in for a juice and rest our weary legs after trekking through the meandering streets of Edinburgh trying to seek out the best Fringe shows. \n\nIt was pretty busy but we managed to squeeze ourselves in and find a couple of seats in which to sit and sip on our lemonades. I liked the buzz around the place but I get the impression that was purely down to Fringe antics and that this place isn't usually filled with people in fancy dress much like the rest of Edinburgh around festival time.\n\nAs far as bars go, it's a-okay, and if you're looking for a lunchtime drink or a quick couple of drinks then it fits the bill perfectly."
4,"A great experience, great driver. On time - text alert for ETA very reasonably priced"
3,"I had fun at this show.  We opted for the dinner/show package and didn't pay full price -- I wouldn't either.  Bumped up $10/person for a \""cozy\"" booth along the centerline.\n\nPros:\n     Great Frank and Dino impersonators.\n     Awesome band.\n     Really transported me back.\n     Decent drinks and cocktail waitress (a nice Polish girl)\n     The third best thing to do on Freemont street.\n\nCons:\n     Plaza is \""under construction\"" and resembles Beruit.\n     Food is similar to fundraising dinner food.\n     Joey Bishop impersonator was funny, but shouldn't sing.\n     Waaaaaay too much reverb on the voices.\n\nOverall it beats the hell out of one of the topless revues and lets you wander Freemont before/after the show."
2,"Slow slow slow service from our server.  \nNot the best start.\n\nCame for the apple pancake cuz it's been years since we've had it.  Also ordered the chorizo & cheese omelette.  We're going to split these two entrees so it is going to be more than enough.\nCoffee is good.  Limited soda selection so my dining guest ordered the strawberry lemonade which gets one free refill.\n\nThey do NOT take credit card, it's cash only and for your convenience (?) they have an ATM available.  Seriously, why pay credit card processing fees when you can collect money by making an ATM machine available.  :-p\n\nThe omelette WAS yummy, the pancake was pretty good but I actually needed to use a tiny bit of syrup for each bite cuz it seemed to lack the intensity I had remembered.  Must be aging brain cells.\n\nService picked up once our waitress finally took our order.  \nIt seems there are plenty of regulars that visit this place.\n\nHeads up on the parking.  It seems as if the parking space is kind of lacking.  It looked as if customers have to park in the street it the small lot is full.\n\nWill we be going here again anytime soon?  Nah, it's not likely unless I have an out of town guest or a hankerin' for another apple pancake."
1,"No toaster. NO TOASTER. WHY must the best bagels in CLT be forced into a sauna to steam away all their crusty, crunchy potential?\n\nToppings are diverse, coffee is good. Staff is cute and stoned. Decor is rad, and I feel totally comfy, until EVERYTHING IN MY 6 DOLLAR BREKKIE SAMMICH comes pouring out, onto my lap, onto my dry-clean-only Interview Shirt, and then that's it - I'm throwing a tantrum (in my head at least) and tossing the wet mess into the bin. Give us the option, kids. Don't be Steamer Fascists."
0,"Wolfgang Struck out on this one.  7 member squad and nobody liked it.  Very bland, very boring.  We're all from NJ & NY so maybe that's why??  Wouldn't spend another dollar there again."
2,"My first time to this place was back in January 2011 after it was recommended by a friend. This place is not cheap by any means between myself and two others, the bill came to about $400. But my issue isn't so much with the money as it is the quality and value I expected to get for that price.\n\nI went on the cheaper side by getting a Surf and Turf for $65. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad either. I thought the lobster was actually better than the steak. My friend ordered the Surf and Turf as well and he shared the same opinion: it was just OK. The bottom line is: It wasn't worth $400.\n\nAfterwards, I shared my disappointment with the friend who recommended this place to me. He said Surf and Turf wasn't the way to go and I should've ordered the Wagyu beef or filet. So a couple of days ago, I gave it another shot.\n\nWe went with a group of 12 people. The waiter highly recommended the chef special where you can get three courses but at least two people have to order it. I asked what the difference was between the beef in the Surf and Turf and the one in the special. He said the Surf and Turf was a grade 6 (it was 6 or 7) and the special was a grade 9. So I decided to join two others and placed the order.\n\nWe got three different cuts of Wagyu beef with this combo. There was filet mignon, new york, and ribeye. We asked for medium rare but all three cuts came out as medium. It was pink in the center but all three of us felt that it was overdone. When we compared all three with our friends who ordered just the standalone filet, theirs was actually done just right. Somehow, medium rare for the standalone was better and done correctly but the more expensive one was not. Go figure.\n\nTo say the least, the waiter was nice about it and gave good service throughout the entire time. He took back all three cuts and asked the kitchen to give us new ones. That took about 10 to 15 mins. Once the food came, it came out just the way we asked and expected...medium rare. It was tender and very pink for all three cuts.\n\nNone of us were able to finish all the beef. I think part of the reason was that it was too rich. The amount of oil from the serving dish was pretty thick. We had asparagus, mushroom risotto, and baby spinach as sides so they contributed to the feast.\n\nHere's my bottom line. I gave this place second try and it didn't really make me feel any better. I spent quite a bit more this time...$175 for my meal and the overall experience was just barely OK. I'd never come back here again because I don't feel like it's worth my money. I can easily go to a different steakhouse for $100 in Vegas to get a better value."
2,"Walking around Caesars Palace to cool off and grab a snack.  This place was there and their menu seemed appetizing.  Decided to order from the takeout window instead of sitting down to eat.\n\nThis place is right next to the sportsbook so if you're there, you can grab a snack and watch/bet on sports as well.\n\nGot the loaded waffle nachos.  Crispy waffle fries topped with some bacon, nacho cheese and sour cream.  Garnished with some parsley.\n\nYes, there are better places to eat.  But sometimes you just want something quick while walking around.  Got our food pretty fast as well."
3,Great donuts and open 24/7.  I love their buttermilk donuts and they have these adorable little filled donut holes.
2,"One of the things I love about this place is the outdoor seating in the cooler months.  I also love the Bellini, Toasted Ravioli, and Rosemary-Chicken Pizza.\n\nThere IS room for improvement, however.  The takeout \""system\"" they are using has caused me to go somewhere else more than once.  I don't think that having certain pickup \""windows\"" for loyal customers is a sufficient way to reward them, especially at that price point.\n\nOregano's, you have a LOT of good competition (especially in Central Phoenix) so you may want to rethink the way you are treating customers.  I'm going to try you out again soon so we'll see how things go from there."
1,"Be prepared to drop some serious cash here at the Shoppes. (I'm wondering myself why they added an 'e' in shoppes - maybe for that added flavor of pretention, haha). They definitely don't mess around here with high-end shops like Barney's New York, Coach, and Burberry just to name a few. Built just across the street from the Wynn Hotel and their own bougie shops, I'm sure they aim to cater to that same crowd. \n\nMy friends and I walked into Michael Kors and there was a purse that caught her eye. She picks it up and then asked an associate how much it was. He casually replies, \""That one is $1400.\"" Upon hearing this, she immediately returned the purse to the display, looks at us, says \""Okay,\"" and walks away from the bag. With our incomes, we can only dream about getting the stuff here. Unless you can afford all the things here and can actually purchase them - that seems like a lot more fun!\n\nNothing special about the decor of the Shoppes. But, there is one thing worthy of note, a waterfall that is two-stories high at the center of the mall. Be prepared to see lots of tourists taking pictures. And hey, why not take one yourself? \n\nFor the hard-working middle class schmo and \""normal\"" crowds, I recommend the Miracle Mile shops or Fashion Show Mall. I'm sure once the blazing summer heat kicks in, people will use this mall as an air-conditioned excuse to stay off the strip."
4,"I came here 2 years ago for lunch and I haven't been able to stop my mouth from watering every time I think about the burger I had here. The build your own burger is an awesome idea! I forgot which bun I had with my kobe beef, swiss, portobello, and avocado burger with a side of sweet potato fries, but it was the best burger I've had so far. I didn't get a chance to go back when I was in Vegas last year but I will not leave until I have my burger from Burger Bar when I go next month!"
2,"Having lived in both southern and northern California, I found the food to be good but not great.  4 stars because I know how crappy the other Indian food in Vegas is.  3 stars because the service was not very good, and the manager argued with me about the bill after I claimed 2 separate Yelp offers (neither claimed they had to be used exclusively, and they took the order with no issue when I showed them the offers I was planning on using).  The daals were the best part of the meal."
4,"My boyfriend made reservations here for my birthday dinner. The view was amazing (at night)  and the food was delicious. We both ordered the surf and turf my lobster was so good and my steak so tender and moist . My boyfriend who usually doesn't like his steaks medium rare ended up finishing my plate!  he said and I quote \"" best steak hes ever had\"" we came at night and the vibe was romantic."
1,"I connected through CLT on a recent trip. I have to say, as a former resident of the Charlotte area, and after experiencing the ease of my home airport (Dallas-Fort Worth Int'l), this airport could be so much better.\n\nIt seems that CLT just keeps building on to itself and is making itself bigger and stretched so far that it is now a chore to have a connecting flight there."
4,"Great craft cocktails, featuring a lot of bourbon.  Drink service is medium-slow, but that's mostly because they spend a lot of time getting drinks right instead of slinging bad drinks quickly.\n\nThe door and windows are covered over; you have to look for it.  That has an enormous benefit; it's intentionally only visited by people who specifically went there, and the hordes of roving drunks in the Southside miss this place entirely.  They seem to be sacking short-term popularity... for long term lasting power as a terrific little bar."
0,Something has changed at this location...I'm a regular here and the drive thru service has been slow for the last 3 weeks...If doesn't improve looks like Dutch bros will be worth the trip.
3,"I have been very impressed with Dr. Yocham and the entire staff at Southside Animal Hospital. My dog Lucy has a tendency to be very timid around new people and he has always done his best to make her feel comfortable and calm. He also is very affordable. It is a breath of fresh air to take a dog to a vet and not be reccommended expensive medications and multiple follow up visits. \n\nWhen Lucy was exposed to Parvo I called a local vet who wanted $30 just to walk in the door and have a discussion with me, not satisfied with this I brought her to Dr. Yocham. He explained that since she was current on her vaccinations she was in no danger. He told me to monitor her behavior and explained all the sign to watch for. This visit was free of charge. \n\nHe won my trust on that visit and I have taken her back to him for all her vaccinations. They do not make appointments for visits so there can be quite a wait at times, but his caring and a dedication radiates in his work. I would reccomend him for any of your four legged family members."
2,"First of all, I'm not a fan of the price for a small/easy quesadilla.  I am a fan of the potatoes and green chile quesadilla I had because I think the combo and smell was really great.  I ordered thinking it was going to be some type of gooey green sauce, but instead it's like grilled sliced potatoes and strips of green chile and pico de gallo mix (onions/tomatoe).  As soon as I opened the little box it smelled so yummy!\n\nI also had the orange/mango drink which tasted like kool-aid or some type of powder mix....I guess it thought it would be like a fresh ingredients type of drink with a little pulp or something..  Anyhow, the glass it comes in is really big and can be used to store other things.  From reading other reviews I understand if you take it back you get a $1 off your next order?  I would never had known that because no one told me when I ordered it :(\n\n$12 dollars total for lunch...and I picked up 3 cupcakes from Urban Cookies! Yummy...  Apparently if you follow them on Facebook sometimes they give you a code word or something to get a free cupcake!"
2,"went to F.A.M.E. specifically for this place and wasn't disappointed at all. only let down was that they only had vanilla filling. was advised that they usually have two flavors of fillings depending on how busy they get per day. they have vanilla,  green tea, hazelnut,  chocolate, and strawberry. I wouldn't mind giving green tea and hazelnut a go but not this time. I got the eclaire (chocolate dipped original) a coco and a cookie with vanilla filling. Lets start with the cookie. It  had bits of cookie all over the pastry and the cookie bit tasted good. it wasn't filled all the way and had almost 50% air inside the puff pastry and was a little let down. I read sok reviews that said it was filled with alot of filling so I was expecting the same. With that said all of the three cream puffs I got was filled the same and to me was not filled enough. the vanilla cream had a very light taste but it had a good consistency and good texture. the puff itself was made well and held the filling as it should. we then had the eclaire. it was go was go the chocolate added what seemed as a missing flavor if it had any and was a nice semisweet and not so much sugar it hurts your teeth chocolate. Then the coco puff. it was a coco puff with vanilla filling and I am glad I saved that one for last as it was the best one. the coco puff had great chcocolate flag and with the vanilla filling was a good combo. The workers were nice and greeted us and was very easy to talk to. Overall it is an ok cream puff, if I am in the area I would stop in to see if they have anymore flavors for the day besides vanilla but I dont think I'll be making a special trip just for these anything soon, unless they bring the sweet potatoes one here then ill be back lol!"
0,"FUGGHET ABOUT IT! I personally know one of the male cooks who works there and from what he tells me the pizzas are left out way past holding times, no one uses gloves, money is touched then the same hands touch pizza. You couldn't give that to me for free! Yuck."
1,"Nice facilities. Line guys are awesome, desk staff not so much. Fuel is uber-expensive, but ramp fees aren't too bad if you don't meet minimum fuel requirements to waive the fee.  This is what you get when there's no competitors on the field."
1,"I couldn't even detect the hops in what they assured me was the IPA. The rare sirloin was the rarest rose. The breakfast burrito was good. Service was quite friendly. Smoky atmosphere, of course."
4,"If you haven't been to Wah Kee, this restaurant needs to be next on your dining experience list. In a sea of pre-fab noodle places, Wah Kee continues to create all dishes from scratch, all noodles from scratch, and all of the  food is fresh and prepared masterfully by seasoned chefs. This dining spot has been around for years  and is family owned and operated. It is not glitzy like some of the national chains- but if you are interested in very good, authentic food at a very reasonable price, skip the bagged noodle places and try Wah Kee."
4,"I can only say good things about Napoli Pizza! Lord where do I start?! Well first off the prices are amazing! Even getting a medium pizza for a family of three feeds us for more than four days. The mushroom and pepperoni is mouth watering good! We usually order our pizza for pick-up or delivery, but going into the place is nice as well. The place is very quaint, and very nice. They have a couple of big screen TVs as well as a nice dinning room. Their staff is also friendly, friendly and extremely patient. Napoli will always be are go to for pizza, and I dare another pizza joint to even TRY and be better than Napolis!"
2,The tandoori chicken was overcooked and dry. The chicken tikka masala was a bit too salty. They serve garlic naan and give you free chai tea so that was nice.
3,It seems this restaurants it serves both Thai and Vietnamese food. The deco reflects such as well. Towards the front of the restaurant or some well lit tables with some large windows. Towards the back is more dimly lit tables for the more romantic atmosphere. \n\nThere is a very large selection of foods from appetizer to entr\u00e9es to desserts and even drinks. I had ordered the steam chinking dumplings. They were 6 of the biggest dumplings stuffed with a lot of meat. The grilled pork chops and lemongrass was very juicy and tender. One of the better ones I've had. I'm going to have to try the pho and Thai curry next time.
0,"It's 2 for 1 review day!  I can't review the Walmart without reviewing the McDonald's that resides inside.  And boy is it some tantalizing stuff.\n\nI try not to give too many 1-star reviews but this McDonald's so deserves it.  I hardly frequent a McDonald's at all (although this is my second McDonald's review in less than a week) but I need to let the peeps in on this one.  No Yelper should go unwarned.  \n\nOf course I came to McDonald's since I have those coupons for their new contraption, the McWrap.  Which when I pronounce very fast and in my Scottish accent sounds much like 'McCrap'.  After my second go round with this thing, I have made up my mind it is decidedly so.  I need to write McDonald's execs to change the name on this thing immediately.\n\nMy coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink, get a McWrap of your choice for FREE.  I have a hard time resisting free.  I'm here to tell you...WORST ALMOST FREE MEAL OF MY LIFE!!!  Seriously.\n\nIt was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy.  I patiently waited for almost 10 minutes...which is like forever in McDonald's time.  At least two folks left the line while I was there.  I know it's not McDonald's fault, but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs.  And they were very loud.  This doesn't bother me much.  But...they were also very stinky.  Yes, stinky.  I have no problem with stinky in most cases (I occasionally help the homeless so I know) but the guy in front of me hadn't washed in DAYS if I were to guess.  To each his own, and I know it's almost summer so I know we all want to save water...but DAMN.  If I get a whiff and I have to take a step back?  You might be S-T-I-N-K-Y.  But who am I to judge?  I took a big step back and waited my turn.  Free is the motivation here.  I finally get up there to the McDonald's cashier and present my coupon to the guy.  He takes a look at it and says 'We don't usually take the promo coupons at this location but we'll let you use it.\""  Then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack of...more coupons!  Mind boggling to say the least.  He takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink, asks me what type of McWrap I want (Grilled Chicken & Bacon) and rings me up.  $2.91 later I'm given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be called.\n\nI wait.  And wait.  #1!  #2!  #3!  #5!  #6!  #7!  #8!  Obviously I'm #4 and 10 minutes later I am still waiting.  Honestly, what the Hell are you guys doing back there?  Mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla?  Feathering a chicken?  Perhaps ripening a tomato?  I ask the McDonald's runner and he tells me, \""We're waiting for your McWrap.\""  Of course.\n\nAt this point I'm almost running late to be back at work, so the minute I get my order I bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk.  Thankfully I'm only three minutes away.  I really, really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of Reese's chocolate peanut butter eggs from last Easter.  Talk about disappointment!  I take out my McWrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk.  I continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be McDonald's claim to fame.  Their golden fries.  I bite into one, eh a bit stale.  I bit into another one, eh not enough salt.  I bite into yet another one, eh cold??  I look down, and whaddaya know?  My damn fry is not even barely cooked!  White like Olivia Wilde in the winter.  I look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly!  Not golden brown!  Not delicious!  Barely out of their frozen state, and just limp.  Not acceptable!  Please check my pic for proof of this travesty.  McDonald's not doing their fries right is like IKEA not serving their Swedish Meatballs with gravy.  NO BUENO.\n\nAfter getting over this somewhat I finally hit my stride to go on to my Grilled Chicken & Bacon McWrap.  Wow, talk about lightning striking twice.  This thing was lifeless!  After unwrapping this beast (the box is still the best part about this McWrap), I could just tell something was off.  Tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long.  The chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either.  After some hesitation, I took a bite.  UGH I say, UGH!  Freshness was not part of the gameplan for this McDonald's today.  All cold and soggy!  And upon all, my McWrap wasn't built correctly!  Instead of having Spring Mix like it's supposed to, there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce!  And my bacon was missing!  In the words of our Lord Darth Vader....NOOOOOOOO!  It was McCrap through & through.  Totally upset over this one.  I have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well.  \n\nMcDonald's you have pissed off the wrong fatty.  I will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure.  Knowing my luck I'll get a coupon for a free McWrap.  CRAP."
1,"Trendy atmosphere, friendly yet slow staff, good sandwich but not mind-blowing. Maybe I expected too much."
0,"I came here for a filling after not having time to get it completed by my hometown dentist over Christmas break in early 2011. Not only was the filling $120 (no insurance), payment was demanded immediately upon exit, I also felt very disrespected by the office as a whole. The front staff is very curt and short. The gentleman who did my drilling had a patronizing and smart alleck attitude. When asking questions about the procedure he was doing, he mockingly imitated my voice (I am sorry I am not the most clear and articulate when I have a rod down my mouth getting a filling) to ask me what I said. He was very patronizing the whole time and unsympathetic to my legitimate worries I had seeing as this was the first time I went to a dentist other than the one I went to my entire life since childhood. I would never go back under any circumstance.\n\nEDIT: In my original review I stated this procedure was $250. The correct amount was actually $120. My apologies."
2,"So I was mad pumped about having a ramen house in the neighborhood ... and it was dope on the more over. Good size portions, yummy broth, great hot sake. A few downfalls: My dinner partners food (chicken something or other with noodles - not 100% sure) was way less than good - like way less than good. The server was obviously super new at the game and wicked nervous. He came to the table 9 million times - but I get that... 1st day on the job. I didn't like that the things that we ordered were one price on the menu and another price on the bill (every item we ordered).  I do look forward to returning to try something new very soon but I hope that it is a little more smooth the next time I stop in. As they are very new I am sure that the kinks are still being worked out. I say try it for sure.... It was a great rainy day choice."
4,Best Lo Mein anywhere in this town! Their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced. We paid them many visits and were never disappointed. They deliver as well.
3,"Very good italian restaurant within Caesar's Palace. We've had dinner here twice and both times were great. Their meatballs are fantastic. The service staff are knowledgable, helpful, and friendly. You can't ask for better."
0,"I just moved to Phoenix from Chicago and I've also lived in Lexington Ky this is the first time I've seen so many superfluous charges on my electric bill.  If you subtract the $28 to install (when power was already on btw) my fees add up to $50 and my actual electric usage was $30 for the month of december.  I've never seen a delivery charge for electric in my life (gas yes, but that makes sense).  This delivery charge was divided into 2 segments one being $17 and the other $6.  I hope someone can tell me that SRP doesn't have this kind of fees as we are most likely moving to Mesa."
0,"The absolute worst!!! STAY AWAY!!!! The convenience of the hotel in conjunction to the rest of the strip and the price means absolutely nothing. Always remember the old saying, \""you get what you pay for\"". For a new hotel, everything was old.. even the clock radio. Hell, the tv was a Zenith (and not a flat screen). Who the hell in this day and age does not have a flat screen in their hotel?? Even the Riviera, which is a heck of a lot older, has flat screens and waaaaaaaaaaaay better customer service. \nDon't ask the SUPERVISOR (not manager as he told us) NOE for any assistance. He was completely useless, talked really low as if he wasn't confident in what he was saying and finally walked away without completing the transaction at hand.\nAlso, when we got to our room we had no remote, no menu, no ice bucket. We called room service for these items and they told us that we would have to come down stairs for the remote and menu and the ice we had to pay $1.00/cup if we wanted them to bring us ice (not only was there no ice bucket but the ice machine on the 6th floor didn't work). WTH!! Where is the customer service?? Where is my menu? Where is my remote?? Where is anything!! And let's not forget the living room-sized casino. \nAll in all this was the worst Vegas hotel experience EVER."
1,"Overrated. I would probably chose it over McDonald's or Burger King, but I fail to see what makes people go totally apesh*t over this place. The burgers are good, don't get me wrong, but they're nothing like what some people make them out to be. And what's with the lack of condiments? Blasphemy! Oh, and \""spread\""?!? WTF is this garbage that you're trying to pass off as an acceptable substitute for the variety of burger toppings that, for reasons I'm unaware of, aren't available here? Whatever this crap is, it's nasty. \n\nFries are average, and their shakes are ok (mine was a bit thin and runny). Reminds me of a low-budget Steak'n'Shake, which has MUCH better shakes and a lot more variety on their menu. (if only I could transplant one of these bad boys from the midwest...)\n\nAgain, even after eating here numerous times, I still fail to see how this place could even come close to living up to the hype. Sure, the whole \""secret menu\"" was a genius marketing gimmick, but this place is mediocrity at best. If I want the best possible \""fast food\"" burger, I'll go to Culver's which is far superior and gives it's patrons what we deserve...some freakin' choices!"
1,"Situ\u00e9 \u00e0 deux pas du m\u00e9tro Place St-Henri, ce spa est un havre de paix dans un quartier en plein essor.

Bien que j'aime l'endroit en soi,  je n'y retournerai pas \u00e0 moins qu'il soit repris par une autre \u00e9quipe. J'ai seulement vraiment appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 mon 1er massage \u00e0 cet endroit.\n\nIl y a eu quelques erreurs entre des clients lors de mon dernier passage et de plus, je n'ai jamais pu obtenir le re\u00e7u pour fins d'imp\u00f4ts que j'avais r\u00e9clam\u00e9, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s plusieurs suivis t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques.

Dernier d\u00e9tail, il est parfois absolument impossible d'\u00eatre servi en fran\u00e7ais.

2,"Nice burger 'n' dog shop. OK beer selection. Ordered the Mexicali Burger \""special\"" but there was nothing special about the burger. It was good, just not memorable. Also ordered the Fire Dogs. Good that you get 2 dogs, but still a bit pricey. It's cheaper to order the regular 2 dog plate and build your own. Good fries selection; cajun and sweet potato fries especially.\n\nFun atmosphere. Quasi kid-friendly with a dedicated menu and free ice cream for the youngin's.\n\nMy guess is Eat Here Now is tapping into the pre/post movie crowd and lunch time business crowd. Not sure I would go out of my way when there are many other burger places close by.\n\nIf Eat Here Now wants to find a niche market, they should focus on hot dogs. Not too many places in CLT that offer a variety of dog selections, or create your own. Think about it."
4,"Sweet Addiction has done something amazing here -- they managed to scoop up the nostalgia of Thrifty ice cream, smother it between some freshly-baked cookies, and smack me in the face with deliciousness.\n\nThe folks here weren't kidding around with their store name. There has to be something around here to satisfy even the sweetest of tooths. They have a variety of items here, including something more unique: frozen hot chocolate. However, for my initial visit, I had to try their signature cookie ice cream sandwich.\n\nI went with strawberry cheesecake ice cream with some oatmeal raisin cookies. The cookies literally just came out of the oven. They were warm, soft, and wrapped around the ice cream nicely. The ice cream slowly fused with the cookie as it slowly began to melt. Combining these two powers seemed unreal. I was expecting Captain Planet to come around at any second.\n\nI took a bite and was floored by shock. This was delicious.\n\nIt's not often that I'm excited about a new place, but an amazing staff, coupled along with an extremely reasonably priced (and delicious) menu is enough to keep me coming back for more.\n\nPro-tip: Check to see if any cookies just came out of the oven. Those go so well with the ice cream."
3,"I recently moved here and am renting through a private owner. Tip: Renting through a private owner is a lot cheaper than going with the actual Red Rox office. However, owners vary and some don't take care of tenants as well as others. Fortunately, the owner of my unit is really attentive! Coming from the San Francisco bay area, I have to say that these units are amazing - especially for the price!\n\nA few things about the area: it's not the kind of place where you can walk down the street and visit a local coffee shop or diner. You pretty much have to drive to get around. However, it is centrally located, so everything you could need or want is a short drive away. The unit I have has poor water pressure - especially in the shower. The mailboxes are at the entrance, so depending on where you live, you need to take a short walk to check the mail. Those are pretty much it for the cons. Now for the good stuff...\n\nThe 1-bedroom unit I'm in is really spacious. The kitchen has a pantry and is adjacent to the laundry room. Yes, a washer/dryer in the unit is a total plus (and it has shelf space above the w/d to store soap and such)! The bathroom is huge and has a small linen closet inside, along with ample cabinet space. The dining area (which I converted into a home office) has built-in shelves. I'm in love with my new walk-in closet. Also, each room has a ton of outlets! If that weren't enough, there's even a storage space outside in the patio area. My unit came with one covered parking space and there's a lot extra spaces for guests to visit (not covered, though).\n\nThe complex has two pools, a place to rent in case you want to throw a nicely-sized party, and a small gym. They have an on-site office that has limited hours.\n\nThe best part of this place is that it's super quiet! I can't really hear my neighbors and the area is clean and well-maintained. In all, I'm really happy with my new humble abode:)"
3,Recently renovated. Very effective and well-flowing floor plan. The section for well behaved children and brats is located on the complete other side of the building from the rest of the library. Genius!
4,"Great food , great service, nice atmosphere."
1,"Dined here last night with a large group coworkers. You would think having the word \""Arrogant\"" in the name and the fact it's a steak house they would know how to cook a steak. Well you'd be wrong. Every single one of us that ordered steak received it overcooked. I ordered mine medium and was served leather on a plate. We made management aware of this yet when the bills came we all were charged full price. Which was about $70 per person. After my friend went up to the manager to fight for my bill, because I had only 1 bite of steak and the rest sat on my plate, were we all given a 50% discount. I will not dine here again. With all the choices in Phoenix, I say skip this place."
2,"I think I'm a little bias because I loved this casino when it was Aladdin, but I just feel like ever since PH has taken over, it hasn't been quite the same. They try to jazz up the interior by putting in deep rich colored carpets and a very Hollywood and/or nightlife-like atmosphere, but for the most part the casino looks the same and all the slots are still old. \n\nThe rooms I would imagine to be quite nice but PH is always a must visit for me every time I come to Vegas simply because I'm a big fan of the Miracle Mile shops. I love that there are so many stores, normal stores at that, which sell normal people underpriced, on sale and great size selection items. I love that they kept the thunderstorms in the shops. Mostly though, I love the random strips of casino through the shopping so when you're tired, you can take a seat, lose some money, and keep going!\n\nThe casino is arranged in an ok fashion, they somehow have a Pink's hot dogs stand outside although I'm not sure how authentic it really is ... The buffet is the same and I still like it, but I don't think it has *as* much variety as before. Their shows are somewhat lackluster as compared to other casinos. I don't know that I would necessarily stay here again, but if there was some killer deal it's definitely not a BAD hotel to be at."
1,"I am giving this place two stars because the tacos are good. The service, on the other hand is terrible. Please hire more people. It took an hour for an order of two tacos to arrive at my table. Yes, it was a busy night but COME ON it's tacos! Most of the things that go in it are already prepared. You will not get my money again Ta Chido...and I like tacos ALOT."
2,I'm kinda at a lost for words because I like how the place is set up and in the beginning when you come here they make you feel happy but after you order your first round they seem to not care about serving you anymore..you literally have to call them or you never get in your second order or drink refills...you guys have some work to do..ive tried this place twice so its not because they were busy or the server..
0,"Charging guys $100 to get in last Friday night.  No wonder there was no line.  Who in their right mind would pay $100 on a normal Friday night?  Well it was Beyonce's after party.  Still,  something says the ppl aren't that dumb with this economy to pay that.  Maybe if it was NYE.  Needless to say,  I went over to another club across the street with a line that was pretty deep.\n\nThis is a beautiful club from what I've heard."
0,"The food may be cheap but you do have to put up with some atrocious customer disservice. From the maitre d to the waiter, everyone made it clear you are a bother and should just go away. You have to be pretty thick-skinned to put up with such nonsense for a big plate of meat."
0,"After 5 hours of nonstop driving from SD to Las Vegas, the fam decided to stop by the \""asian\"" area and get some food before we checked in at our hotel. Bad choice.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you are greeted with a wall of awards, recognitions, and accolades from websites and critics. I've been to a Sam Woo BBQ before, and this was uncommon. I thought it would lead to a good start, I was wrong.\n\nThose awards were issued in 2001, and boy, did they really change the restaurant till now. I ordered the roast pork and roast duck rice dish. Just to let you know, the prices for the food served here are double the price if the Sam Woo back in SD ($7-$10, Las Vegas Sam Woo $7-$20). Came pretty fast. The duck was OK, but the pork was really fatty. In fact, it was almost ALL fat. Not too good.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, ordered the Singapore noodles. While we were eating our food and finishing up, his food hasnt even left the kitchen yet. We asked if they forgot his order, and one of the waiters jus rudely replied:\n\n\""Its coming out, wait.\""\n\nAfter 10 minutes we asked again. Turned out they JUST started the order the second time we asked. The waiter didnt even acknowledge the chefs in the kitchen to see if they started. The food came, but the service spoke for itself already.\n\nNO GOOD."
3,Free bean dip and salsa! The chips are hot and fresh. The portions are large so splitting helps to save money. I loved the mango margarita and the ambiance is fun. Great location!
0,"Terrible service, waited 45 minutes for 3 tacos, I believe they had 1 sever for the whole restaurant.\n\nNot only that, saw the manager, big guy, absolutely no regard for what was happening, on a busy day (Mexico's World Cup game) he did not care about the place, I hope he's not the guy in charge of firefly and the tacos place because he might be the reason they're failing.\n\nI urge firefly and tacos and beer ownership group to get rid of a manager that doesn't care about both places after all that's happening.\n\nI believe management is responsible for the failure of the brand, unsanitary practices start at the top. With his attitude, place is going nowhere.\n\nDo not recommend this place, service is horrible and it seems management doesn't care about Tanya customers.\n\nThere are many taco places in town, I suggest you visit a different spot, manager in charge ( I believe his name is Dave) does not give a damn about the people patronizing his spot.\n\nAvoid at all cost."
4,"We came back for the fajitas......and weren't disappointed at all!\n\nThe fresh chips, salsa and beans, and grilled onions & peppers were delicious and a great way to start the evening.\nWe both ordered the fajitas for two with pork and chicken.  My pork was packed with flavor, tender, and most amazing.  I'm totally not a fajita kind of guy, but you give me this place as an option; We'll be back!"
0,"I was excited to try out this salon, because of all of the great reviews. I did see one where their messages were never returned, but I still gave it a try. Unfortunately, I got the same service as the other reviewer, I called (which seems to be the persons cell phone) left a message with my info and asked to schedule an appointment. Never hear back.... Which in the end is for the best because I found a great new salon with great customer service and even better stylist."
0,"This used to be one of our favorite sushi spots, up until recently. We've ate here quite a few times but the service is their downfall. We went on a Thursday around 4 and received horrible service, considering they were not that busy. It took us about 30minutes to receive our appetizers, fine. But after already having been there 45 minutes the waitress still hadn't come back to take our order! Appalling, since she had walked by our table about 10times and couldn't be bothered to at least take our order! We were getting frustrated, especially since they give your table a time limit. \nSo we stopped the manager as she walked by and made her aware of the situation. Instead of taking charge and handling the situation (umm.. Hello? Take our order!) she just kept saying sorry sorry and walked away. Incompetent! \nWe walked out of there. As soon as we hit the parking lot the manager now wanted to handle it and offer discounts or whatever  she could do to make us come back in. Needless to say, we are never coming back here. \nIt's a shame. The menu is great and I like the fact that they will make custom orders. Also they have a kids menu which is nice, but I was shocked to find out my 8 year old would have to pay adult price for AYCE!!!"
2,"Nothing to go out of your way to get, but not bad if you're in a pinch. On my last visit I ordered the Hunan chicken, rated spicy but won't make you break a sweat. The veggies were colorful and seemed fresh. The chicken was white meat, not chewy and cooked just right. The sauce was salty like you'd expect at a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place, but not congealed. The fried rice was fine -- I've had much greasier -- but the egg rolls leave something to be desired. They seemed a little dry and lacked flavor. I was the only person in the restaurant and waited 5 minutes for them to finish my order while a couple other people came in to pick up their takeout. Decent place to grab some Chinese takeout when you're unprepared for dinner and sick of burgers or pizza, with service much faster than the location closer to home in Verona."
0,"Unhappy.  That will sum it up.  My room (Room 201) was nice enough when I walked in, but upon inspection, I saw it wasn't very clean. For starters, it had not been vacuumed. Sure, there were new linens on the bed, but why were there used sweet and low packets all over the dresser, trash on the floor, and, get this, an empty soap box shoved underneath the bathroom light fixture. \n\nThe hotel is non-smoking, but everyone at the pool was lit up.  A hotel worker did come by to tell them to put their cigarettes out, but once she left they just lit up again. *repeat scenario about six more times*.  I couldn't even enjoy a moment in the hot tub, (which is nice) because some jerk kept throwing trash around it.\n\nThis is my final complaint..... no accountability to police what people are doing around the hotel.  Huge groups of douche bag frat boys and sorority princesses pounding drinks and screaming or laughing at the top of their lungs directly in front of other people's hotel rooms from midnight to 6 a.m.  I have no problem with people having a good time, but at 2 a.m., stay the f*** away from in front of my hotel room, especially if your obnoxious laugh sounds like a hyena being raped.  I wanted to strangle the female that kept me up for an hour and a half with her \""I have no real personality so I make this sound to seem interesting\"" laugh.  Luckily my wife called the front desk and filed the complaint.  \n\nMy only pluses for this place.  Once the front desk is called with a complaint, they go and try to stop it (too bad this is a reactionary response), key word being try, since it seems they do not really enforce any of their own rules.  Free soda's and junk food.  Free wifi. Yup, that's about it."
4,"I am an avid fan of Groupon/Living Social/Deal Chicken you name it, I am looking for a deal! With that being said I have tried many boxing/kickboxing gyms before trying Arizona Combat.\n\nI bought a Living Social for the Women's Boot-Camp in September of 2012 and here it is March of 2013 and I'm an active member of this gym.  I cannot get enough of this place. \n\nThe women's classes kick your butt, I mean that in every literal sense of the sentence but we still have so much fun doing it! Each trainer works with you as an individual and helps you gain the knowledge you need in order to work out properly and push yourself further than you would on your own at home doing some video.\n\nI love this gym. I would highly recommend it to anyone that has a desire to work out and work out hard!\n\nI am here to tell you that I have never felt better in my life."
3,"This place is banging!\n\nA group of us from work decided to head here Friday night to celebrate something. What it was evades me, and probably isn't that important. What matters is we were able to take over the upstairs balcony, have good service and drink like we were back in college. \n\nThe times I've eaten here before, it's always been very good. I did not eat last night; rather, I imbibed quite liberally. Three Guinnesses and two Irish Car Bombs later, I was pleasantly relaxed and had to kick it. I was glad I hadn't driven because parking is at a premium. That and the whole drinking and driving thing is so 1988. Buzzed walking is tubular!"
4,"Some tasty food here, we come here a lot and just love the food, The deviled eggs are the most delicious things ever, The best thing here is the hamburgers, They use kobe beef (the best kind you kind eat) and it's high quality and fresh, also juicy. YUM.  friendly and inviting atmosphere to this place as well."
3,"It's Friday 5:00pm-- where should I go to get my happy hour fix? Came here straight from work after a looooong week! I heard about their 2 for 1 drinks and had to check it out. \n\nThey have a crazy amount of beer selection! I'm not much of a beer drinker but I do like trying fruity ciders or ales. Decided on blackberry cider ($5) and pear cider ($4). It's 2 for 1 so basically we got 4 beers for $9. That is a steal! It's pretty much a beer lovers heaven. \n \nDuring happy hour appetizers are either $3, $6, or $9! So for Food-- I decided on the steak nachos ($6). These were pretty damn creative. On top of each tortilla chip is all the ingredients in nachos and the cheese was melted on top surrounding all the ingredients. So it wasn't messy like nachos usually is. You just pick up the chip and eat it. Of course the portion isn't as big as they usually are but it still filled me up. \n\nThe beau got the chicken wings with fries ($6). Pretty good. I liked how the wings were just the right amount of hot. The fries stood out to me. It was crispy and seasoned just right. They weren't just regular ol' fries you find at a bar. \n\nAtmosphere is pretty laid back. There's bunch of TVs for the games. It was pretty packed when I got here but our server, Jose, did a good job checking on us."
0,"I was studying for finals and so driving back and forth to campus a lot.  All of a sudden one evening my car's coolant light went on.  I take care of my car and so was concerned about the light.  I took it into Purcells where they proceeded to tell me that my car might overheat and explode if I continued to drive it, thus making me their captive.  I called my fiancee and told him the deal.  A couple hours later Purcells contacted me and said the engine needed repair and would cost around $900.  I asked if there were any sort of discounts and they said no.  Then when my fiancee went in they magically made it only cost $700.  I still don't think anything was wrong with my engine after all is said and done, but just paid them and went on my way, vowing to never come back."
4,"I don't know why their spices are so much better than what you can buy in the grocery store, but they do.  \n\nTheir taco seasoning is my favorite.  Ever since using it on tacos I can't use the packages from the grocery store.  It is so much better.  \n\nI also love their selection of ghost pepper, which is so hard to find in a pure form without being combined with other peppers and flavors.  \n\nThe owners are very nice and everyone is helpful and offers creative uses for new dishes."
0,"So I went to this bar last night with a group from work. The bar tender was extremely friendly and had a great personality. This was during the Sunday night football game so there were roughly 15 people in the bar. After the game, it was only my group of 3 and 1 other customer. So we moved to a table and attempted to order food! There seemed to be a waitress on site but did not come to our table! I had to walk up to the kitchen window and order food as if I was at McDonalds!! Only difference is McDonalds would have had better service! The \""waitress\"" seemed to not care about anything except the fact she was friends with the owner! I asked if there was any specials and the girl yelled to the bar tender \""is the game on still on\""! Once she realized the game was over she said NOPE! Sense it was a celebration with my team, I ordered a pizza anyway! I should have taken my team to Pizza Hut, the service would have been better and the food sure would have as well! No need to stop or order food from here it will be a waste of time and money!"
1,"Let's just say it like this... if you are Asian, or have a solid grasp of Asian cuisine then it is very likely that this place will not impress you the slightest. \n\nYour spread over numerous different menus from Korean, Japanese, Chinese, you get the idea and none of it is really on point. \n\nThe location in the M Resort is very clean, well staffed for the most part and managed but the food falls very very short of delicious. Might i suggest they put a plum wine by the glass instead of the standard white and red options as this is an Asian restaurant and that would be helpful to a small couple that doesnt want a whole bottle. I have eaten here on a number of occasions, one of them being my Korean grandmothers birthday since she was staying at M it was quite convenient. We ordered the Kalbi for the table, which was VERY fatty and although had flavor was quite salty. My grandmother made the comment of the Kalbi from the buffet having better quality cuts of short ribs which is pretty sad honestly. We ordered the Bibimbap which certainly was not authentic and the meat was a bit off, as well as the HARD rice that was used. My spicy seafood stew which seemed like a mix of Ramen and Jjampong, where the broth wasnt total shiet the noodles were still in the SQUARE block as if they took them out the package and forgot to cook them. I refuse to eat here again, its simply not worth the efforts to take a chance on this place. The food is not executed well, and quite tasteless in most cases. Its a shame since the location is quite nice."
4,"As much as I love Lux, I'm kinda glad that it's not closer to my house, otherwise they might have all of my money. Working from home, I need to get out and set up shop elsewhere every once in a while so that I don't start talking to my houseplants, and more often than not, Lux is my destination.\n\nThe service at Lux is always friendly and often funny. And I've sat close enough to the register enough times to hear them being friendly to people of all ages, shapes and sizes. The coffee is rich, dark and delicious. I usually stick with a house coffee with soy milk, so I do ok price-wise. I even buy the whole beans to brew my own coffee at home. I like it that much.\n\nLux gets packed, but I've always been able to find a space and get access to an outlet for my power sucking laptop (not an apple, by the by). The music is good and mellow--think the Shins or the Stones. They've also got killer pastries, and if you time it right, you'll get them fresh out da oven.\n\nCoffee shops are all kind of a personal preference thing. There are lots of good spots in Phoenix, but Lux is my favorite."
0,"I have a coworker who has had several issues with the management & maintenance at The Villages at Metro apartments. After moving from one apartment to another within the same complex, she was hit with several \""hidden charges\"" that NO ONE advised her of until after it was a done deal. This started when the transfer process first started. Every time she would talk to the office, the prices would change. Finally was able to get a set price which she paid, then when she went in to get the keys & sign papers there was one issue after another, including the amount owed changing yet again!! On the day she went in to sign paperwork & get keys, they were no where near being ready for a move in (as promised). There were many, many items not completed. She patiently waited until the next morning when the movers arrived and still many things not ready. The maintenance crew left & said they would come back - never did. They finally came back days later & did some of the items that were not done, but after being in the new apartment for a couple months there are STILL several items that still need attention in the apartment - things that were never completed when she moved in. On top of all that, she then started receiving past due notices. She had spoken with the office manager when she first received the notice. The manager said it was for a cleaning deposit on the old apartment... she said since there had been such inconveniences with the whole transition and items still not being properly fixed in the new apartment that she would have that fee waived. Since that conversation 2 additional notices were sent out & the price has now tripled. She pays rent on time every month, she is a good tenant & has been really patient, but is now more than a little frustrated. She called the office again & got nothing but the run around - assistant manger \""explaining\"" all the fees, yet these were NEVER communicated to their tenant, just thrown on her account & racking up ridiculous past due fees when told she wouldn't have to pay the move out costs? Absolute BULL!!"
3,"we were looking for mexican food in our trip to vegas until we found this place.........\n\nwe tried the carne asada tacos and were great, but we came back the next day and ordered a shrimp cocktail and it was THE BEST shrimp cocktail EVER.\n\nI have tried a lot of places for a good sea food cocktail but none compare to this one, all natural shrimp and octopus (optional) lots of avocado and the hand made tortilla chips were hecka good...... and dont even bother to order the small size cup, go for the large size if you really like sea food,\n\nour kids ordered the quesadilla and the torta and were excellent as well,\nthe place is clean and prices are decent.\n\nthe only reason for the 4 stars is the lack of fresh salsa bar and tortilla chips provided to costumers when waiting for the order. Almost forgot,..... they could inprove the fish ceviche tostadas........... \n\noverall the place is worth the traveling from the strip (like 10 mins) and the money......"
0,"Pretentious and overrated.  The staff here seem to look down their noses at diners which is comical as this restaurant is located in a strip mall and its interior looks like a barn.  The food many on this site seem to like was overpriced and less than spectacular.  I have been there for dinner and brunch, and was disappointed by the fare and service both times. The turkey meatballs, which are touted as one of their specialties,  were tasteless and hard. The pizza dough was also hard and the toppings lacked any depth of flavor.  For brunch I ordered the  hash which was hands down the  absolute worst hash I ever had the misfortune to eat.  The cook must have known it was horrible as he tried to compensate by dousing  it with an enormous amount of salt.  One could get better tasting food at the  Cheesecake Factory  right across the street  at Boca Park without the snooty attitude and for far less money."
1,"Cheap. Not inexpensive, cheap. There's a difference. Aldi works very hard to cut prices, well below even the local Wal-Mart's everyday low prices.\n\nAldi is different than the usual American supermarket style. There are only a few aisles in the store and Aldi typically doesn't carry more than one or two brands of any particular product and you probably won't recognize the names on the labels (GT Cola? Contessa canned veggies?). If you have a specific shopping list, you're going to be leaving without a good number of items, but the ones they do have are very well priced. I'd have to guess at least 20% less than Wal-Mart.\n\nWhen you're headed to Aldi, it has to be pretty well planned. Bring your own bags because they don't have any. You can usually find a couple of cardboard boxes in the shelves if you forget bags. Even the shopping carts aren't \""free\"" - because they want a 25 cent deposit and it's returned when you return the cart. As far as paying for your goodies, they do not accept credit cards or checks - cash or debit only because credit cards cost money!\n\nWould I shop again at Aldi? Maybe. Sometimes it's worth spending more when you shop at Harris Teeter (or even Wal-Mart) because you get a lot more convenience and choice."
2,"Pretty decent New Mexican food. Chimichanga was a bit soggy and serving sizes could be larger.\n\nNothing extremely \""New Mexican\"" about this place. The owner was pretty cool though. All in all this is just cafe style mexican food a tiny step above a place like Filibertos and a step below Arribas. You can take it from there.\n\n\nIf you want a real treat and a good dive, try Elmers tacos. Much better although it's in the geto."
1,"Otherwise known as the 10th Circle of Vegas Hell.  I would have given it one star, but it does cater nicely to a certain demographic, and who am I to judge?!  But unless you are of that demographic (alcoholic trailer-park-dwelling assembly-line-worker-on-vacation-from-Rustbucket, USA), you might share my low opinion of this depressing place.  \n\nCarnaval Court tries really hard to be cheerful and fun.  REALLY HARD!  But all the ear-splittingly-loud Bon Jovi covers and manically juggled cheap booze in the world can't mask the oppresively depressing nature of the bar's denizens: blue collar mooks, on perpetual Spring Break from a third-tier community college, desperate to bag whatever beat-up white trash trim they can scare up.  Bachelerotte parties celebrating some unfortunate muffin-topped truck-stop waitress's thrird marriage.  Bowling alley attendants and their factory-worker wives, gaping maws open wide and turned up like baby birds to catch the cheap drizzle of sticky booze being poured down like proletariat manna by the bartenders, who tend to get up on the bar and tease the patrons with \""free shots\"" poured directly from unmarked bottles.  Good times!\n\nActually, this place would be pretty good people watching, if it weren't so ear-splittingly, soul-shatteringly LOUD!  Not only does the live cover band BLARE one played-out  classic rock party anthem after another, but the bartenders (seemingly all 500 of them) constantly blast shrilly into the metal whistles tightly clamped in their grimaces, and repeatedly bang their metal cocktail shakers onto the metal bar... OVER and OVER and OVER, in a grim, desperate attempt at merrymaking.  This place is DETERMINED TO MANUFACTURE FUN OUT OF NOISE, as if sound waves can conquer misery and squalor.  Good luck with, that, guys!!!"
0,"Went to El Zocalo tonight to enjoy some good food and also enjoy the ambiance with my wife. I have been to this establishment before and never remembered if the food was good or not. I ordered the Tierra y Mar plate which is steak and shrimp on the grill with a side of rice and beans. I asked for my steak to be done medium, when we received our orders seemed to be 35 minutes later my steak was well done and had not an ounce of flavor to it. The shrimp was so salty I could only eat but one. When the waiter finally came back to see how it was going I told him that I was not happy with the plate. He asked if I wanted something else and I refused. I had tried my wife's plate (chicken Enchiladas) and it was mediocre so I wasn't going to waste my time. At the end of the night the waiter apologized and said that the manager discounted my plate 50%. Why the manager didn't come out to see what I thought was wrong is beyond me. Honestly the only reason I will go back is for the music and the beer, my food experience was sub-par. For the price save yourself some money and go to Rosita's in Mesa or El Rico's in Gilbert. \nTerrible food experience."
3,"I love that this Dunkin' Donuts has a drive-thru. I wish other Dunkin' Donuts would follow their lead. This location is very convenient for me as it's near a gas station and just off the freeway. Somebody said they had slow service here. I've never had that problem. Took my husband here for a little breakfast date. Yes, we actually set the alarm and went here around 9AM. Love the donuts and the donut prices. Love that they have coolattas and pumpkin-spiced coffee near Halloween. Love the selection of donuts. I just wish the coffee prices were a little less and that's all that's keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Love the breakfast but I think you should get two breakfast wraps for a buck, not just one. This place is staffed by responsible teenages. It's a clean location with clean bathrooms."
1,"I don't understand why everyone is so positive about this buffet. We've eaten at the wicked spoon with the 6 of us today and all of us think that this is one of the worst buffets in Vegas.\nThe quality and choice of dishes does not meet up to the high price of this buffet.\nThe salmon was far from well cooked and had been on the warm plate much to long, so was the shrimp. \nThe carvery was pretty much the same as most low budget buffets and there was no steak or lamb chops or something like that which I think you may expect for the price they charge.\nAlso meat and fish stand right next to eachother which ruins the meat for people who don't like or can't eat seafood. \nI will never visit this buffet again, I'll go to Spice Market at PH or the buffet at MGM instead."
2,"This was barely a 3 based on pretty good food, ok prices and 1 of our 2 waiters being ok. The other waiter a taller guy with scruff was awful. No smile, no warmth, didn't bring steak sauce upon request. He ruined the whole visit. We won't be back. Oh and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table when we got there and there was a dozen seats open and the very table we say in was ready upon arrival."
0,Never really had a problem with this chipotle But had a terrible experience today. Employees were super rude from start to finish. Awful customer service. The lady at the end started rolling my burrito before I was even finished ordering. Never asked if I wanted anything else. Brought it home and right as I began to eat I noticed a decent sized black line on my tortilla - sharpie. Avoided the entire middle of my burrito. Sharpie isn't toxic but it's still not good to ingest. Disappointing because this chipotle is very close to my house. But it isn't much farther to go to 90th and Shea. I will not be returning to this location.
4,"I am new to the area, I\nNeeded to find a good salon and hairdresser, I had seen all the great reviews about Sweet Salon so I thought I would give it a try. I love the salon it's very adorable! My stylist Paige was amazing! She new exactly what I wanted and did a great job, she has a great personality and is very stylish and adorable, they are very affordable also! Great place would totally recommend it and I will be a continued customer!"
4,I love this place for 1 reason and that is the staff!! I enjoyed going to Mermaids and sitting at the back bar talking to a bartender named Raquel. She was the reason why I came to this place so often. I recently stopped by there and found out she no longer works there and was bummed out. She was super friendly and always served me and my friends with a friendly smile.
1,"Wait staff is in need of training and this place generally seems confused as to what type of business they are. Front of building says \""Smokehouse and Tavern\"" which would lead many to believe that it's a restaurant with a bar. The reality is that it's a sports bar that serves food and that is exactly what I got when eating there, \""Bar Food\"". I ordered a blue cheese and bacon hamburger (over priced in my opinion). I explained to the waitress that I wanted the meat done just so it was a little pink in the middle and she said \""so we'll go with medium rare\"" , I went along with it figuring she worked there and she would know best since I explained in detail what I wanted. Result: It came out very rare and almost raw in my opinion (just barely browned on outside and all pink everywhere else), there was barely any blue cheese to taste on it and the bottom half of my bun was soaked in grease just like I would expect from a burger at a bar. \n\nMy summary: might be a good place to get a drink and watch the game, but eat at your own risk.\nP.S. I saw another reviewer compliment them on the lunch menu, I went during the dinner hour."
3,I thought the frozen yogurt was good and the concept worked real well. People easily got their  frozen yogurt in a timely fashion and wow they were packed!
3,"I would've never heard about Envy if restaurants. com wasn't doing the 80% off coupon specials for this place. I guess for the locals, this is one of their favorite steak houses off the strip. It is a bit aways from the strip on Paradise Ave. Fortunately I was driving, I manage to find the Renaissance hotel and this place. \n\nThe parking and walking from the car part definitely was an adventure. The restaurant was buried way in the corner of the lobby and the best part was there were no signs that tell us how to get there. I guess I got spoiled by all those other casinos on the strip. Would be nice if there was a post it note on side of a beam some where..but oh well. \n\nI came here right when they opened up at 5pm for dinner service. We had a very friendly waiter that didn't give us the dirty look because we were planning on using the restaurants .com coupon. Since we didn't have a huge appetite, we decided to share off the prix-fixe menu. Apparently thats a huge no no and its designated for one person. So we ended up getting the Envy signature bone in steak and a side of 3 cheese mac and cheese. \n\nThe appetizer arrived close to 30-45 mins after our order. I wasn't too annoyed since I wasn't hungry, and we got time to conversate and enjoy the decor at this place. They also gave us some bread with butter to munch on while they were firing up the grills. \n\nThe steak finally came split in two, and they creatively added some decor to the plate for both of us. I thought that was nice on their part since we were sharing and that we each got our own dinner plates. The mac and cheese came in a bowl on its own. I would say for $10, it was a very small bowl. The steak tasted wonderful, and not over cooked since I ordered it done medium well. Meat is meat, its all up to how much you cook it and how the flavor is. I would give them an A+ on the steak. The mac and cheese on the other hand had this funky odor. Probably smelled like some wet socks after football. Not to mention that it was way too salty. I could barely chew on the mac and cheese without crunching on another granulate of salt. Someone went crazy with the shaker in the back.\n\nEither ways, we only had to pay half the price with our restaurant's .com discount. Next time we will definitely go with a $50 off $100 coupon so we can get a bunch of leftovers for the suite.  I will definitely pay Envy another visit."
2,"Only 8 calories an ounce for yummy creamy indulgence that won't have the buttons popping off your shirt! They have flavors that rotate and for the full fat full flavor seekers they serve Thrifty ice cream as well. I personally feel their small is big enough. Open late, friendly too. Ask for a sample as some flavors are great and others to me are just so so."
4,"I have eaten at many Mediterranean Restaurants in Arizona, aside from other states and overseas. The Persian Room is, by far, one of the best in Arizona, if not The Best. You will find a mixed crowd there and it is as casual as you want it to be. From large parties celebrating an occasion, business meetings, families, couples and friends, everyone is welcome. Now back to the food...I have had several dishes including the Chicken Filet Sultani, Barg, Sultani, Naderi, and Gyros, and all were wonderful. All seasoned well and very tender. To start off, the Tah Dig (crispy rice) topped with Gheimeh stew is delicious. You can have that alone as a meal, but most parties start with this as an appetizer, along with Shirazi Salad. Most meals are served with Basmati Rice and you can choose Shirazi Salad to accompany it. If you go after 5pm, you will have the opportunity to try their freshly baked pita bread, as well. My absolute favorite entree is the Koobideh (seasoned ground beef and minced onions). It is the best I have ever had. Just be forewarned, the portions are large. So be prepared to take half your dish home, which is just as good the next day. All in all, the service is wonderful and the food is outstanding. If you have yet to try Mediterranean food, why not start with the best...OR try someplace else and then try The Persian Room to compare. You can thank me later. ;)"
1,"We went here recently was surprised it was not as busy as usual - Server was fine and the hostess but the food was awfully bland and tasteless.\nThe Marinara sauce was so plain with no salt or spices . We may just have been served canned tomatoes. Salad was ok the first time but when we ordered a second bowl the server did not ask about the cheese nor were there peppercinis or onions. Just plain lettuce. Wont be going back again too soon,,,,,"
2,"Minimum Age: 21+.\nCost: ~$30\nCrowd: Mixed, 20-30's.\nDress Code: Fashionable attire.\nMusic: Top 40.\nDate Attended: 01/23/10, Saturday\n\nThe best part about Ghost Bar is the outside view!  Situated at the top of the Palms, you get to see Las Vegas from a great vantage point.  Nothing else really stood out to me.\n\nPros: Great vantage point.\n\nCons: None."
4,The piercer Kat was awesome and Effie aka stef at the front rocked and recommended some good tattoo places! Great people really quick service and great everything and affordable!
3,I've always been a happy camper leaving this place. \nThey have a very cool looking bar with their bottles lit up and colorful. I like sitting at the tables around it even though the lighting is bad. It's like the flashlight under your face effect. Not cute!\nI prefer the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna for the appetizer. The tuna comes out on a slaw that tastes amazing with a soy dressing and a side of wasabi you can mix in. This isn't a fish restaurant but I get on a fish-kick and LOVE their Blacked Fish Sandwich. It's always cooked perfectly and really like the sauce. The steamed broccoli are big pieces and always fresh. I wouldn't recommend the honey roasted carrots - they are soaked in whatever they are calling honey roasted and just tastes like carrots coated in sugar. Yuck. \nI like dessert and like chocolate but don't like anything from here. Maybe too much white chocolate for me.
1,"Went there on a Saturday night for beers after a day moving with friends. The beer selection is great, and they have a happy hour from 3 to 6. The waitress did not let us know of the special and by the time we realized the special, she reappeared 5 minutes too late. She was, however, nice.\n\nThe place feels overall unclean. The good reviews on the walls from past times only added to my impression that the pub is falling apart. \n\nAmbiance was dive-bar like, and they have spotlights instead of regular lights if you like to constantly feel like you're a stage performer.\n\nTo top it off, no hard liquor allowed in the gaming areas.\n\nI just feel like the owner stopped trying. A shame as it has great potential."
2,"Stopped by while I was downtown working. It was busy, lunch hour and downtown = busy, so to be expected.\n\nThey actually messed up my order. Instead of a double bacon cheese burger they just gave me a cheese burger. \nI only realized it once I was sitting outside. I just took that as a sign I shouldn't really be eating this unhealthy stuff so I just ate it, as well as the couple dollars."
1,"So so food...but I liked the patio.  Better food, and cheaper, can be had at Elmers or Filibertos."
2,"If this is your first Cirque Du Soleil show you'll probably enjoy it, it's a nice mix of their previous shows. But if you've been to previous shows like I have since Nouvelle Experience, you won't be as impressed. Their soundtrack is just ok.  Prefer others. But I do think it's better than Dralion, which I felt was an overpriced for a Chinese acrobats show. \n\nUsually pretty easy to get tickets."
4,"My family and I have been coming here for years and we just adore this place! The service is always excellent and the food is spot on, every time. Brunch on Sunday's is a great way to start the day!\n\nDRINK:\nWhite Sangria, Lucy's spiked lemonade or my favorite, the St. Bernardus ABT 12 dark beer.\n\nAPPETIZER:\nEither the Deviled Eggs or the Chicken Nachitos\n\nENTREE:\nChelsea's Cheeseburger or the Chicken Taco plate (I order the blackened chicken option, at an additional cost) will blow your mind! \n\nDESSERT:\nRed Velvet Cake (TO DIE FOR!)\n\nOh, and bonus-- If you decide not to get dessert, the FREE cookie on your way out the door, will totally get you hooked!"
0,"I used to get service done here on all 4 of my vehicles.  But since their turnover rate of employees is so high and they keep putting more arrogant front desk or managers there the service has become awefull.  Right now there is a new guy in there again (mgr) and hes is trying to make that dollar off of everything very hard.  He needs his sales obviously!   \n\nNow, there is one amazing Mechanic.  GARY!  HE IS THE BEST!  Not sure if he works there anymore.   This place has gone down hill.  Other than checking ur tire pressure this service center is as bad as PUUUUUFECT AUTO.   STAY AWAY!"
2,Good for a fast health food alternative than burger king. Busy with people and got my food out fast.
0,"We attempted to use this cab co. to take us home from two spots -- Carnegie Natural History Museum and Ross Park Mall. At Carnegie, We waited a1.5 hrs for a taxi to come cuz 1) Dispatch sucked and sent them somewhere else and 2) I swear the cabbies dont want to drive out of the way, so they don't. From the mall, no taxi was even dispatched! Again, they probably don't want to drive out of the way but then why not say so instead of leading us to believe they are at least trying. Feeling stranded in a city sucks. The city needs a better taxi service!!"
0,"I have been going to this golf course for over 15 years it's a hit or miss on coarse, as far as the condition.    You have a fun little nine hole family owned place to go.  They recently have remodeled the club house. I have been going once a week since last October with my dad.  Not any more I complained to the manager of the restaurant of the poor service you get it is hit or miss weather or not your going to get acknowledged or served especially in the late afternoon when I have gone with neighbors.   My dad went to the Valentines day dinner thought it was great so we decided to go for Easter Brunch Mistake...  we arrived at 12 most of the food like the fruit and deserts were picked over they had three scrambled egg dishes salad ham and turkey I think marginal Brunch not very attentive staff although they actually had plenty.  There was three in my party they added a 20% gratuity and the bill came to $88 I will never go back and I live in the neighborhood.   I gave you many chances and complained and you still couldn't figure it out. ."
2,"My first visit to SWINA was an accident- I had an appt. for a massage at SWIHA and mistakenly turned into the parking lot next door.  The second time was when reparations at SWIHA caused them to close shop and move all appointments (including my massage) here.  I was not able to enjoy the massage as much, bec. the open ceilings allowed all sorts of noises (conversations, construction noises coming from next door, etc.) in- too distracting.\n\nI was able to experience my first mud wrap after first reading about SWINA's offering back in June '08 last Friday.  I'd have to say it was nothing I thought it would be.  I thought I'd be lying in a bed of mud (like I've seen in European travel logs) w/ some slices of fruit or veggies covering my eyes (no, not cucumber slices... I'm allergic to cukes!).  Nope.  No mud bed.  No sliced garnishes placed on the windows of my soul.  However, I did get two women to simultaneously massage my back (Cassie) and leg muscles (Patty)!!  Woah!  So this is what tandem massages are all about!!  I asked if this was standard practice here in SWINA, 'cause if it is, I could definitely get used to this!  But no, I'm told that I got lucky that day, w/ students' schedules opening up at just the right moment to allow me this extra luxury.  (If you ask me, I think it's a ploy to get newbies to come back for treatments week after week!)\n\nBut let's backtrack a bit and start in the beginning.  After stripping down to my comfort level (topless), and lying face down on the massage table (I requested a face pillow for more comfort), Cassie and Patty proceeded to give me the back and leg massages.  Afterwards, they employed natural brushes over exposed areas for an all-over exfoliation.  The sensations ranged from slightly ticklish to soothing (you may tailor the pressure exerted).  I was asked to flip over onto my back, and soon after, the mud was then painted on by both women with another set of brushes.  This was when the treatment started to go downhill for me... the mud was applied cold, and thank goodness there was a heat lamp nearby to keep me warm.  After painting my back, arms, legs, and abs, the two women proceeded to wrap plastic around my extremities and then again w/ another wrap that was already laid on top of the massage table under me.  (If you suffer from claustrophobia, body wraps are not for you!)  Patty then left Cassie to help another student.  Cassie then proceeded to give me my second favorite part of the treatment, which is a head and neck massage.  Nice!!  After, Cassie offered to give me something complimentary- a facial massage!  Would I want one?  Why, yes, thank you very much!  After all that pampering, we were now at the point where I again had to endure chills while Cassie wiped off the mud w/ warm towels.  But I requested hotter towels, as in steaming hot!, and poor Cassie... her hands were burning!, but she did what I requested, and I was able to stave off the chills for awhile.  To \""wrap\"" things up, Cassie followed up w/ a hypoallergenic Lotus Touch lotion.  \n\nMy skin felt supple, but nothing different than what I'd experience after a bath at home using Aveda Soothing Therapy salts.  On the whole, the experience was good, but most of it is bec. of Cassie's bedside manner.  I wouldn't hesitate to ask for her again.  However, I don't think I'd try another wrap- SWINA offers three: mud, seaweed, and herbal- since I'd rather not get chilled, plus the plastic wraps used aren't biodegradeable, so I'd feel guilty causing all that pollution!  I'd say that the tandem, head, neck, and facial massages were my favorite parts, and for that, I'll just stick w/ SWIHA.  I will be back to try other services (hour-long facials for $30, anyone?)."
2,I moved to downtown phoenix and haven't had a chance to come back. Although I have heard from friends that this place has improved. Management/Owner messaged me on here apologizing for my experience and apparently you can now smoke out on their patio. \nSo that's a plus for the smokers/bell road crowd. \n\nOnce I make it back here I will again update my review but I felt compelled to say something since the owner was nice and pleasant. Unlike the cheers tavern owner. (You can look at my review of that place to understand).
4,"Good Price, Food Good,Good Services.. What else would a person want???Oh wait we are talking about humans People that complain, about the smallest things.\""went and stood in line,waited 2 minutes I give this plcae a 1 star\"" Grow up people you cant always get it your way. The best thing about this place is they are always on the ball with the food. Little hint if you can get there a few minutes before the price change you can have your meal for a cheaper price!!!!"
3,"Good local place with no snottsdale attitude.  Cheap drinks & a funny crowd.\nI read the 2 star review below & you have to consider the source- a high heeled pizza eating girl who gets miffed because she has to go to the bar & get her drinks.\nGo back to Club Douchey, princess."
4,"Friendly service, great food  and always very clean....this is especially impressive since this DQ sits right across the street from a High School and a block from an Elementary School!"
3,"Well I am a big fan Chef Ramsey and his styles of food so I am biased, I had the pork burger, was a great spin a burger.  Truffle fries are a must get, and the chipotle ketchup was great as well.  The atmosphere is loud and modern, we enjoyed that.  \nThe waitstaff was the part not quite up to par with what I would expect from a GR restaurant.  They could be a bit more attentive and less social with each other and pay attention to the customers.  \nThe wait was fine, greeters were nice.\nOverall it's a $50-$75 burger trip, but the uniqueness and experience is worth it."
0,"We waited for more than an hour and a half to get our food. It wasn't even that good, it was normal. But the smoothies were better, very healthy and made with real fruits."
2,"Stayed here August 3-6. Upon arrival the Valet service was overwhelmed due to the uncommon down pour at the time but did well considering the conditions. We had a king size bed reserved, but at check in only a two queen bed room was available. Once in the room it had a musky smell and water leaking from the ceiling. The following morning was able to switch rooms and was placed in the east tower and the room was a vast improvement. The one downfall is the lack of wifi in guest rooms when your paying a resort fee (wifi only available on casino floor). Even Motel 6 down the street has wifi. Lastly to smooth things over we were given a 50 dollar voucher for their buffet at More."
2,Food is good if you stick to the core of their menu.  They also have a good beer selection.  Great atmosphere for kids because it is loud.  Biggest complaint is the hostesses; they always act like you are inconveniencing them when you ask for a table.
0,Quite possibly the worst barber shop on the planet. I have never seen haircuts take 45 minutes or longer.  I guess these guys are not interested in making money. If you have 3 hours to kill...this is your spot.
4,Such good ice cream! They have delicious cookies and you can make your own ice cream sandwich to order. I got two scoops of ice cream and four cookies for less than $7. That's a great price compared to other ice cream shops. I will definitely come back again and again
4,This was our first time at this resturant and we were not disppointed.   Our waiter was vinny and his serve was above and beyond.  We had just returned from a trip from cabo and my husand really wanted a pepsi.  All you can get in cabo is coke.  Mojos also serves coke but vinny offer to run next door and get us a pepsi.  What great serve and with a smile.  The food was very good and the prices were reasonable.   We will certainly go back.
2,"I'm still on the fence about this place, but here are some observations:\n\nFranktuary is generally vegan friendly, but the menu lacks informative labeling (as some meat eaters have also pointed out). \n\nThe veggie dogs are the same boring dogs you can get anywhere, but the different executions make them slightly more interesting. I haven't tried the veggie sausage, I think it might have egg in it (example of how a menu indication could be useful). \n\nBeet balls = yum! \n\nGarbanzo fries, also a hit! \n\nSome of the cocktails are way overpriced. The \""Refugio\"" is a nice enough mezcal drink, but it's $14 and not up to par with Salt or Cantina's less pricey concoctions. It was not particularly strong, like a mezcal drink should be; it was rather on the sweet side and was lacking the bitter and sour elements of the grapefruit ingredient. Plus, it is served in a coupe with a plastic straw, which seems tacky and pointless (the straw). I had another even less impressive drink there on my first visit, which I cannot remember...The bartender seems sincere in his efforts, so I hope he can fine tune things a bit, and get the prices in line."
0,"The fun atmosphere and nice staff, plus a great room with an awesome view, can't make up for food poisoning from the America restaurant.  I didn't want to spend my vacation in the bathroom.  We will try a different hotel next time we go to Las Vegas."
3,Seriously good pizza.
1,"I'm on the phone with Linda right now, I called them just in case to let them know the situation after I got the news from the other plumber. and she says that she's doing everything she can make the situation right. I will keep this updated."
2,"This place is pretty good. But could be better for the price. The best thing we had was the habanero honey wings, which had a nice kick, they were sweet and spicy just like I like. I ordered the burger and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the swordfish and baked mac n cheese. Our food was pretty good... But I think my burger could've been better, I ordered the R Fries with it which were also pretty good but could've used some seasoning.  We had a groupon which was helpful, otherwise, be prepared to pay because everythig here is a la carte. \nWould I take that long taxi ride to come back to this place? Probably not."
2,"After a failed attempt at attending a gig (we showed up and there was no one there, not even the bands. Huh strange.) Emily V and I were in need of a suitable place to rest our hats (if we were wearing any, which we weren't) and sup a pint.\n\nThe footba' was on, so we were trying to find somewhere a little less crowded, with seats, and a good selection of beer. Oh and local (it was frickin COLD that night!)\n\nCloisters was the closest we could find, so in we settled. It was fairly busy and buzzing, with a good mix of students, locals, younger and older folk. It's definitely a traditional pub-type joint, without a cocktail in sight. This is all ok, but I think it focusses so much on beer and whisky that they didn't even have coke and lemonade in bottles - it was all tap. For a spirit-girl like myself, this ain't great as it means any spirit and mixer tastes like syrupy water. Blegh.\n\nI should also say that even though it's not my 'scene' I have been to several more traditional ale-houses in both Edinburgh and Glasgow which I enjoyed a hella lot more. So I'm not being biased. It just lacked any charm or personality.\n\nSo, personally, it's not somewhere I'll be hitting up again soon. Probably great for a larger group of folk on a weekday evening, or for a chilled out Saturday night. It's casual and relaxed, and yes they do have a lot of beers. But it just felt a little 'meh' and after my first syrupy vodka and coke, I switched to a cup of tea (much to the bemused look on the barkeepers face). In fact, that reminds me I had asked for vodka tonic so the coke was even less appealing at the time.\n\nIt was still a lovely evening with the ever-delightful Miss VD, but that's no thanks to the venue itself."
3,"It's my first check in, but our fourth time here! ^_^\n\nIt's a local mum and pop shoppe we like to frequent now the we've found donut shoppe whose doughnuts are not overly sweet.\n\nMornings are super busy, but service is warm and timely. \n\nWe love the old fashion sugar donuts, and their boba teas are perfect for warm and sunny day, like today.\n\nPrice is comparable to other donut shoppes in the area. But we get better service here."
1,"\""Not quite what I expected... not quite WHERE I expected either...\""\nReviewed July 24, 2011\n4 people found this review helpful\nI have to agree with another reviewer in that I am not sure how this hotel qualifies as an airport hotel.\n\nI booked this hotel stay for a business (military) event. We had scheduled a team-building group event at the US National White Water Center and so I searched for hotels around that area. When I saw this hotel featured as an airport hotel I figured it would be in a safe enough location with some close-by eateries and quick highway access, etc...\n\nWe booked a total of 13 rooms with them and checked in individually. I had been in contact with one of their hotel managers. I was a little dissatisfied in how poorly I welcomed to the hotel. \n\nThe front desk clerk seemed \""oh-so enthused\"" to be working that night, and when I let her know that I had been in contact with the manager and just wanted to make sure everything was in good standing, she went in the back, he was there, and never even came out to greet me.\n\nNow I didn't expect any VIP treatment. But usually when you organize a group event at a hotel you are give a very warm welcome. I know this because this wasn't a first for me.\n\nI had requested a room with a crib (only two months in advance, with a reminder the day prior), and when I requested one that night, yes the same clerk, took over an hour to get it. At first I wasn't even sure if she was going to because she never did give any indication she was paying attention to me at all.\n\nThe cable and internet did not work our first night there. No apologies were issued.\n\nThe room had a musty smell to it. I have a family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, and one baby) but they only had 3 towel sets in the room...even the next day after housekeeping came.\n\nThe hotel was not in the best of locations, it was secluded and not close to anything, and price-wise you could find better closer to downtown. I am not from Charlotte, NC and had only been there once...and again I figured \""airport\"".\n\nThe hotel interior was nice and they did have a complimentary hot breakfast from served until 0930 am (another fact of information I had to PRY out of the front desk clerk). \n\nThe staff working the morning shift were much more pleasant and inviting. \n\nThe hotel was very quiet at night which we appreciated. The doors did not slam, thank God, as our baby girl is a very light sleeper. The hotel itself is clean and kept nice. It was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express.\n\nI rated poor because of the customer service but overall I would give it a three (average). However, I would not book here again not mainly due to my experience but due to the location. There are better hotels averaging the same distance from the USNWC but in better areas.\n\nIf anyone from management every reads this, please take a look into \""Deborah\"" the front desk jerk...I mean clerk.\n\nStayed July 2011, traveled on business"
0,"Worst customer service ever. Every time I go to this salon there is a LONG WAIT. I'm talking like hours. It's not because their service is good, it's because they have 2 people working all the time and they always tell you it will be 15 minutes and you end up waiting an hour and a half. I just left for the last time I will never go back to NV nails."
2,"Khoury's has amazing food. Whenever I'm craving hummus I know exactly where to go! The servers here though... I don't know what to make of them. The service and the food just don't match up. Sadly, it's not just one of the servers, but all that I've been in contact with except the woman with the accent. She is sweet but you can tell she just doesn't care. I came in one night to pick up a food order and stood at the host desk for no joke, 10minutes. I tried to get the attention of the two girls working and it seemed like they were ignoring me. So they are either that oblivious to what's in front of them or they are just not all the way there. However, the food is so good I always looked past the service until today. I called in a lunch order and I asked the woman on the phone if they had a hummus wrap with veggies and chicken. She said they did but it wasn't on the menu so I went ahead and ordered it. Well come to find out it was a piece of bread, hummus, and cilantro. It was literally an entire order of hummus thrown in a piece of bread. Not cool. I even told her what I wanted. I felt extremely ripped off and it made me not want to return. It makes me sad because I literally love the food, but the waitstaff really needs to be replaced with people who actually care and value customers like the owner does."
4,"This is the greatest addition to the Basset St neighborhood... fantastic service, great food, locally owned, awesome prices, nice atmosphere...I can't say enough. They change the menu 2 times a season, hence the name. The entrees and breakfasts are great. You don't get cheesecake factory sized portions, but you definitely get a good value. They have a great selection of teas,  and offer a full coffee and regular bar. Two brothers own it and you can tell they care about their customers a lot. Get on their mailing list too, they only email once a month and have good specials."
4,"Hands down the best fried chicken in the south!!! It's the perfect balance of crispy outside, juicy inside! \n\nThe place is very unique as it doesn't have seating. You order up and there are a dozen employees working the fryers! \n\nThey charge 85 cents for canned soda and 5 cents for hot sauce, but you have to have hot sauce on this chicken.  They are cash only so be prepared!\n\nI was put into a solid 30 minute food coma after eating this chicken as it's very greasy! But completely worth it and will return soon! ...just not for lunch during a work day! \n\nI suggest eating there on a Saturday or Sunday when it's nice outside so you can just hang outside of the building."
2,"I wanted to like this place more but I think I may have just expected too much. The food is quite good, but unfortunately not prepared that well. The ambience is cute but the service isn't great.\n\n-Chicken BLT - the chicken and bacon were delicious but the flat bread was completely burnt so all I could taste was char. Side salads were yummy though.\n\nI like that they use seasonal and fresh ingredients, but the way it's presented isn't the best. The breakfast items people ordered around me looked tasty though!"
1,"The bartender is great. Hustler, he should be managing the joint...the service for the actual restaurant...sucked ass!  Make sure you don't come too hungry cause you'll be waiting a while...food was moderate for most of our party, they ordered burgers and pulled pork special, I ordered broasted pork chop...stick to the burger and save some $"
4,I've been going to Lani for a while and she is always laughing and smiling. She makes you feel comfortable right away. She has great prices and you can tell she cares a lot. I wouldn't go anywhere else!
0,"Terrible experience at this office. I've gone back twice for the same problem and am still having issues. Ironically enough, before the filling my tooth felt fine and ever since the procedure i've had nothing but problems with the tooth. I will not be returning to this office ever again. Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out."
4,"I love Alexis Park :)\n\nI've stayed here twice now. First time in the standard queen (which was huuge and had a living room area and bar and second time in the Crowne suite - two story loft). They have great prices, great location, great staff, great rooms, great pools, 24 fitness center, security around the campus, etc!\n\nI didn't have one complaint whatsoever. Our AC started getting wonky after the 2nd day. I called and 5 minutes later maintenance came by and had us switch to another room right next door. They even offered to have assistance come and help us move things if needed. They're so friendly! Nice breather to be a little away from the strip.\n\nDefinitely staying here for other future trips."
2,"Is the best bagel place I've been to? No. I came here for a \""to go\"" breakfast with my man. As we were waiting for our food, he whispered to me \""this place is filthy\"". The vent above the bagel rack was so dusty! The counters, floors and tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down either. We had already paid so we just decided to get our food and go. The guy who helped us was very sweet but incredibly slow. We spent almost 20 minutes waiting for 2 bagel sandwiches and a chocolate chip muffin. The bagel sandwiches tasted good (I tried a tomato basil bagel) and liked it. I also thought the variety in bagels was nice. The muffin wasn't my favorite but was edible. Prices were reasonable but nothing great. Just like my review says, A-OK."
0,"Awful service! I used to come her back in 2010 when it was new, the food and staff were awsome! I recently came back and the staff is all new. One word... RUDE. Our waitress seemed pestered when id ask for a refill or when id place another order. Like, um, sorry to bother you at work lady? The food was good, but theres a ton of other sushi places in the east valley with the same grade of food and better service. Its a shame this place shot to shi*, could have been a real gem."
4,"I've been lucky to call Stephanie my stylist for seven years. True has gone through different management changes in that time, but her skill and dedication have been consistent the whole time. I've gone from brunette bobs to Joan Holloway/Mad Men red to ash blonde ombre and every time I go in I know I'm in good, capable hands. Plus, the front desk girls are always sweet, the place is clean and calm and I'm obsessed with their tea."
4,"We are visiting from NYC for a week and we went there for dinner at the suggestion of our concierge at Royal Palms with a promise of a nice view and live music.\nThe Steak was superb!!! I can honestly say it was probably the best Fillet Mignon in my recent memory.  Wine list is very very good, 300% markup is a bit much but I guess that is how they make money. We split carrot cake for desert and it was also out of this world. My only criticism is the cocktail I ordered was Vodka gimlet and it really had no vodka in it, so, instead of complaining about it which i think leads to just another splash of bad vodka and \""bad blood\"" with a waiter, i ordered a shot of Vodka on the side. I got about half of Merlot wine glass of vodka instead of a shot glass and they charge $14 for it! So, my drink ended up costing me $29!\nThe steak was excellent and we will definitely come back next time we are in town."
2,"So disappointed in this restaurant.  Maggiano's  is one of my favorite restaurants in the Chicago area. However, this restaurant left me homesick for the Maggiano's from Chicago. I don't know what they are doing here but the food didn't taste the same, sad."
2,"This place was alright though I have very high expectations for curry based on my experience at the St. Louis Anis Hyderabad Restaurant (shout out!).\nThis is what I ordered:\n- chicken sweet potato curry - excellent dish!!! by far the very based of what I tried and worth ordering again and again. the sweet potato was definitely the star.\n- chicken pad thai - didn't really care for this\n- tom yum soup - not bad,strong lime flavor\n- lamb curry - normally my favorite dish at indian places but this one wasn't very good, beware the whole spices! they are not a pleasant surprise! :p\n- roti paratha - these were pretty good (a little greasy but to be expected since roti  paratha is a fried flour tortilla)\n- veggie samosa - alright as well, comes with a yummy dipping sauce.\n\nSo this place was ok in general though the sweet potato curry is really good. The actually location has really nice bright decor. Enjoyable to visit."
1,"First off, $25 \""resort fee\"" per night, so the published rates are NOT accurate.  Expect your bill to be considerably higher when you check out.  They still want you to pay for upgraded internet speeds even after that fee.  Valet parking is $20; it used to be free.  Edit: turns out the gym is $15 per day to access.  What exactly does this \""resort fee\"" cover, then?\n\nThe place is still under construction.  There was a previous tenant's takeout food in our mini fridge.  No free coffee in a room--seriously?  Motel 6 has free coffee but you want to charge me $4?  The bed was dirty-it had some weird paper substance littered on it, like it had been washed with a roll of TP in the load.  The pillows are bags of cement, although my wife likes that for some unknown reason.  I sleep pillow-less.  The room couch is pretty damn uncomfortable and the place smells like glue.  \n\nThe drinks in the casino are expensive ($12-$15), small and weak and the blackjack odds are terrible (6-5 payback + shufflemasters).  The buffet is expensive ($28) and the food was bad and much of it was labeled incorrectly, so you weren't always sure what you were eating.\n\nNew d\u00e9cor is lovely, though.  I like the two bathroom setup.  I made a reservation for theHotel.  Wish I was actually staying there, because this place sucks."
2,"I had the #6 BBQ Pork...They could put more meat on the sandwiches BUT that might take away from the awesomeness of what they are serving. The bread and its crunchiness is #1 with me followed by the different ingredients on these sandwiches compared to your typical Deli Sandwich = thinly sliced carrot, jalapeno and stuff I dont know LOL!!. They do serve Deli style sandwiches but why do that when you can have something different. And the price is right = $3.39.\n\nI am a former General Manager of a Steakhouse and I KNOW that if the owner is taking care of the little things, more than likely they have already covered the Big things. You can see by the cleanliness of the restroom = Ice in the Urinals!! That they are on the ball. I like the dining room also with the Large screen TV;s and the big over sized booths. \n\nSo if you are in China Town, stop in and enjoy a nice sandwich. Why not? I cant think of a reason. : )"
0,"Erik has a nice website with great pictures talking about deadlines and quality, however, it was all I could do to even get him out to the house to perform an estimate.\n\nI wanted some specific work done to the house/garage, and called for an estimate.  Erik set up a day to come to house.  The day he was suppose to arrive, he text me just prior and stated he was in Scottsdale at a meeting and would have to reschedule.  I said that was fine. We were initially not able to make our schedules work, and we agreed that he would contact me the following week and re-schedule.  I didn't hear from him that next week, then I was out of town for a few days.  Upon returning, I asked him if he still was going to come out and give an estimate.   \n\nHe chose the time to show up, I agreed to it, ( Friday at 1pm prior to Memorial day weekend) and took time out of my day to arrange to be at the house and go over the prospective job.  He showed up, snapped a picture or two of the worksite, taking no measurements, and 2 minutes later said he'd have to come back in on Tuesday at the same time with his foreman to be able to give an estimate.  At this point I'm wondering why I'd bothered to waste my time.\n\nTuesday arrives, exactly 10 minutes before he and the foreman were scheduled to show up, I get a text asking if he can push the estimate another day.  At this point I was tired of delays, wasting time, and tired of being blown off, so I responded \""Honestly, I want someone who will show up and take the job seriously. You were suppose to meet me before and blew me off and now again today.  And you came out and wasted my time last week.  I could have already had this done weeks ago.  I am all set with contractors who are not professional.  I will be writing a review in regards to your lack of professionalism and promptness.\""\n\nHe responded \""lol... What a joke!! Good luck to you. Please don't waste my time with these text messages.\""\n\nSo, no, sorry to say I can't recommend Erik.  Whatever the reason he failed to be able to stick to his schedule, I no longer care.  I want people who show up on time, period.  He may do very good work but I'll never know; his lack of professionalism and promptness was sufficient for me not to want to find out."
4,"BEST LOCAL FOOD DOWNTOWN! Everything I've eaten here was ono, the server P.K. is friendly and the malassadas are better than back home. It's sad when you gotta travel to Vegas to eat good local food. Hawaii is slippin.. HANA HOU ISLAND SUSHI! \n P.S. The only advice I'd give to the owner is to speak to the hotel about the strong deorderizer smell upon entering the casino. It's unappetizing and makes me nautious. That's what stops me from going to eat there as often. It's driving business away, and  I'm forced to do take out and eat it in my hotel room."
2,"I just came here for the view but it made enough of an impression that I'd love to come back fro drinks and food. The view is amazing. On par with Ghostbar. Good music, sexy vibe."
3,"Delicious hot sandwiches,  opened 24 hours, what more do I need to say?\n\nOh, get the meatball sandwich! SO GOOD!"
1,"Real mediocre. High priced food. No rewards cards and the lady with the big silver plugs in her ears is as mean as a brown bear being awoken from a slumber. No trees in the parking lot so no shade and your car will melt in the sun. Hide behind the furniture rental vehicle, it provides an ample amount of shade. Haha but other than that, this place is just really mildly nice. Don't take your kids here, there is a man eating clam in the backyard."
4,"I like Sammys, it's not bad of a chain. I like that they have something for everyone, different flavor fusions. \n\nPizza has a nice crust and I love all the flavor combos- I like the garlic shrimp so far. Duck tacos were good.My favorite thing is the ahi or salmon sliders. I've been to this one like 3 times and a total of 5 times to a different location so I havent tried much, but all has been good and satisfying portions.\n\n Why I give it 5 stars is the service was very attentive, some of the best I've gotten at a casual joint actually. This location has a very attentive staff, back of the house was quick with orders but still cooked things right- kudos! One lunch day in particular a mens baseball team, their kids and familes filled the restaurant soon after we ordered. Our waiter was taking care of us even though they got sieged. Drinks didn't get neglected, had a drink before mine was done. Checked on us often and got our tab taken care of fast.  I do appreciate when people are warm and genuinely friendly- service with a smile does count just as equally as speed and attentiveness."
1,"Why do items look like the staff have been playing kick ball with them? And why are there only a handful of lines open during a busy Saturday when we go? Also do not get the cut fruit in the packages. I have gotten two packages of fruit in the past month that have been sour but the date on them said they were fresh...no Ma'am. The staff being friendly is a hit and miss. Some of the young staff act like they have been working in the cotton field all day. As someone who has been in customer service for ten years, no matter how crappy your day is, still treat the customers nicely and be thankful you have employment. I agree with a previous poster, I'd rather pay double than shop at Walmart again."
0,"I bought the Strawberry Fields mani/pedi Groupon with a friend.  We came in and were led to the back room where there were 2 pedicure stations.  \n\nThe foot spa was not working at my station during my visit. \n\nDuring my pedi, the girl used a strong callous remover on my feet, then applied a sugar scrub which mixed with the callous remover and was spread all over my legs.  She left the callous remover/sugar scrub mixture on my left leg till it burned while she proceeded to do the same thing on my other foot and leg. I had to tell her to wash it off and she seemed surprised that a mere \""sugar scrub\"" would sting.\n\nWhen she began applying the nail polish I'd chosen, it started clumping on my toes. She used paint thinner to try to \""fix\"" the polish but it continued to clump and went on thicker in some places than others. She didn't think anything looked wrong when I pointed this out to her.\n\nShe didn't use toe-dividers, either, to separate my toes. Apparently they don't even have them at this salon, so the polish was all over my feet by the time I left.\n\nBy the time we got to the \""manicure\"", my stylist forgot to soak my fingers, and didn't bother to use any cuticle softener before taking her metal instrument and jabbing/scraping my dry nail beds.  She didn't even clean under my nails. \n\nBecause she had another customer waiting and because the pedi was so bad, I told her not to bother painting my nails.\n\nThis place was a disappointment to say the least."
4,"As good as BBQ gets!!!!!\n\nGreat atmosphere, friendly service, great beer selection and incredible food!  I have lived in Texas and all over the South and I never expected to find the best BBQ in Arizona.  Try it all, you can't go wrong."
3,"We dined at Grotto last Sunday for lunch and, like our last visit, it did not disappoint.  \n\nWe had the Lobster Bisque and Spaghetti & Meatballs.\nBoth were good.  \n\nThe grilled Chicken and Marinara sandwich is also delicious too. Try it if you come here. You won't regret it. \n\nThey also have good salads. \n\nAnother excellent visit."
2,"We went for brunch on Saturday because we had vouchers as part of our hotel package at Vdara.  The vouchers afforded us $20 each for a buffet at any MGM resort.  Honestly?  If I had paid full price for this buffet, I'd have been pissed.  The $25 extra we paid was really not even worth it.\n\nHot breakfast items were lukewarm at best and the dishes honestly just weren't that great.  The husband did enjoy the sushi portion of the buffet and I enjoyed the made to order omelet station.  Other than that, though...not a fan."
3,"Since I am a Hilton Honors member, and my wife Isn't much of a gambling fan, I decided to stay at a hotel which would be quiet and without a casino. The Hilton Grand on the Strip is ideal for anyone who doesn't want to blow $200 a night yet still wants a sweet room. \n\nWhen I opened the door to my room I was surprised to find a full kitchen with washer and dryer, plus a 32 inch flat screen TV. I had then realized that since I was a Hilton Gold member, they upgraded my room. \n\nThe hotel is located across from (what was) the Sahara, so it's just a 5 minute walk to the monorail. Staff is nice and courteous, and if you are willing to spend an hour to view their presentation on property shares, they'll give you $150 !! \n\nThe swimming pool isn't bad, and has plenty of space. There are plenty of waitresses on hand to serve drinks or food as well.\n\n\nAll in all it was a great stay. And I recommend it to anyone who wants a quiet room away from the ringing of casino noise."
1,"Beautiful venue, nothing amazing from the menus and service was so-so. Tried the meatballs which were a rave and I wasn't too fond. Everything was very average and the presentation was low key. Prices didn't reflect what the venue lacked. There are better places that deserve the rating this place has that are way better!"
4,"Two friends and I visited Blue Sky today for the first time.  We all had mani/pedis and it was sheer heaven for all three of us!!  The pedicures they offer were the best any of us have ever had!!  I pass at least 10 salons on the way to Blue Sky but WELL worth the trip!  I'm now a regular, they have won us over for life!"
1,"so far, this is the most deceptive yelp rating we have found. this is NOT a 4.5 star mexican restaurant., and it really isn't even a 3 star eatery. our start here was good, with tasty chips and salsa and a kind waitress whose english was very shaky (all of which we took as a promising sign).  we had high hopes as we waited far too long for our food, but the warning signs were already there; the worst margaritas ever, not even one other party arriving for dinner, and a drab dining room that looked much better in the photos. when the food finally did come, it was just disappointing.  and while the salsa that came with the chips was good, both the red sauce, and green sauce that was brought to the table with the food were both lousy. the beans were salty, the rice was weird, and i believe the taco shells were from a box. not one in our party of 5 were the slightest bit impressed with the food quality. not sure why it's so difficult to find decent mexican food in this town, but it is! steer far away from el ranchero, it's one of the poorest i have ever been to. cannot believe that some people ranked it so highly! the only one in the east valley has received rave reviews from us so far, has been \""susies mexican cafe\"" in east tempe. take the drive!"
3,"A regular haunt of Friday-nite Aruba Swings patrons a few doors down, Viva Las Arepas fueled dancers needs for good food and energy. Having been both to their old shack location, and their now storefront location, their arepas are wonderfully delicious and filling. The guy at the counter always laughed at (with) me when I ordered since I can't pronounce it right, but I get the veggie arepa and the cold arepa with chicken and avocado. The wait isn't long, and they make it when you order it. Better than fast food! Try their mango and passionfruit drinks too!"
4,"We go to NY 54 at least twice a month.  We love to buy the 18\"" thin crust pizza, and since there are four of us, we have it made with different toppings on each quarter.  They are always happy to make the pizza to our order.  Also, they have a good selection of draft beers - I highly recommend giving those a try.  I did try their margarita, but it did not have enough alcohol content for my liking, although the taste was excellent.  There is also a great selection of desserts, which I always buy and take some home for later!"
0,"I would say our experience was less than ideal, but not horrible and didn't want to be too negative on what could have been an isolated incident... but now reading other reviews... I feel like my experience was actually somewhat typical. \n\nMy friend booked this for room because it was well-priced. My friends got a pretty nice suite room that was spacious. Our room was suppose to also be a non-smoking suite, but they instead gave us a \""regular\"" sized room instead, which was quite small (I didn't mind the size since we were only staying a single night and just sleeping)  and worse was that the room had the worse smoke odor I've ever experienced. Now I would stay I've stayed in a decently number of hotels over the years (many of them were the cheapest we could find) and occasionally I've noticed a little bit of a smell in a smoking hotel room - but this was worse I've ever been in after about 5 mins and your eyes start to hurt.\n\nWe went back to change the room and they \""explanation\"" was that when we first checked in... they didn't have a suite, OR a non-smoking room available - so they silently gave us a smoking regular sized room instead. There were some separate issues (which could have been unfortunate coincidences and I'll skip over) but basically it took us an hour (they called for someone to assist, but that person didn't show up, so they had to call someone else) and a talk to the manager before we could change our rooms to at least a non-smoking regular sized room."
0,I think that the filtered reviews are spot on. The regulars talk shit the entire night and won't leave you alone. The sound sucks and the beer was flat. 4 Peaks should be fresh as it comes from a local brewery. The only reason I was there was to get in on the blues jam on Sunday night. Almost got into a fight with the regular. Finally left when I couldn't take any more.
4,Tired of going to mass and not understanding the gospel? Well then this is the church for you! I honestly dislike going to church and being so lost during the gospel because the priest does not make it relatable. Father Nadim on the other hand uses real life experiences when speaking about the gospel. We also had a private mass for both my daughter's baptism and it was great! I was almost brought to tears due to the way Father Nadim explained things during the mass. He also knows how to make things funny which makes time go by fast! My husband and I fully enjoy this church and that doesn't happen often!
2,"I got my Sonic fix, so there is a couple stars for ya.\n\nSadly our fries were VERY undercooked, I didn't get any mustard with my plain hot dog, and we didn't get any napkins.\n\nThese are fast food basics, people."
1,"It's not your mother's spa...it is your grandmother's spa. Literary. The resort is mostly occupied with senior citizens, though nothing is wrong with that. The spa is on the smaller side and looks old. It is also quite dark in comparison with other sun-infused Arizona spas. I was mildly grossed out seeing the toilet stalls adjacent to and facing the jacuzzi area, but, after consideration, it must be gerontologically-appropriate. To make matters better, there are two wheelchair-accessible showers strategically situated in between the toilets and the jacuzzi.   \nEverything else was uneventful and I did not stay long."
3,"Three stars for the food, and an extra for the great margaritas;\n\nFood-wise, I left full but don't remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt, but the service I had was good.\n\nThey've got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes, and the mix was pretty good, too."
0,"Normally an incredible place to eat, however I have seen a decline in the past few months. Today was the second time in 2 weeks I tried to order an item on the menu that was not available, but then my order was incorrect when it arrived. Very disappointed, will not order again, I'd rather drive further and my order be correct. Lastly called the restaurant and the owner answered the phone and told me I was wrong As he was reading the ticket. I am disappointed that my first review is a negative one."
4,"The Lunch Box is the best place to go if you're looking for great food in the University area around UNLV.  The selections are limited, but the quality on everything is top notch, and the menu changes daily, so you'll never know what you'll see.  The Chef and Owner, Joe, used to work at Bouchon, and is originally from Chicago.  He is a very nice guy, and everything he makes is great!\n\nThe menu consists mostly of Hot Dogs, but the daily specials consist of everything from Korean Tacos to Pork Belly Sandwiches.  The Chicago Dog is my favorite, but he also has several other styles, all served with all-beef, Kosher Hot Dogs.  The Chicago Dog is a served standard Chicago-style, and that's just how I like it.  All beef Hot Dog, chopped onion, fresh tomato, pickle, hot peppers, mustard, ketchup, and celery salt.  Perfect Hot Dog, and no one does it better in Las Vegas than The Lunch Box.  \nThe Chilean Dog has avocado, spicy mayo, sauerkraut (great sauerkraut, by the way), tomato, and other basics on the all-beef Hot Dog.  \nThey also have a Coleslaw Dog, and a Chili-Cheese Dog.  \n\nThe desserts at The Lunch Box are also very good.  In fact, their desserts are better than many of the places dedicated to dessert.  They have house-made Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee that is fantastic.  They also have had House-made Waffle and Ice Cream Sandwich.  I have also seen shaved ice on the dessert menu, as well.  \n\nIf you go to UNLV, work around there, or happen to be in the area, I'd highly suggest stopping by The Lunch Box.  You will support a small business that is focused on quality, and get a great meal at the same time.  It's also a very affordable lunch.  Most of the Hot Dogs are around $3.50, and my whole meal usually is around $5."
1,Been to other locations and had wonderful experience there. So I figured I would go here but it was a bad experience way to demanding for me to order as soon as we sat down so we got up and left.
4,"This place is amazing! Tonight was my first time here at this new place! I remembered this place when it was Chinese gourmet! The place looks bigger now, it's more open! I literally walked I'm dumbfounded because I was expecting to walk in to the Chinese gourmet buffet lay out! The hostess/waitress was very nice and friendly! She informed me that she has only been there for a month (I would not have noticed that if she did not tell me, that's how good she was!) She was the only waitress working and she was taking care of 3 tables and got to me as soon as I walked in the door, she took my to go order and went back to her tables while waiting for my order! I also got a free glass of water while I waited! I am glad it is down the street from my house because I will continue to go there! :)"
2,I had a nice time celebrating at the club. My only issue it that the well drinks are very strong with cheap liquor. If you use less liquor you can afford to buy a better grade of liquor.
4,"How often do you get to be a pastry chef for awhile at a nice restaurant? Well I was one tonight.   More on that later.\n\nWe always overlook going to Nove because of its out of the way location so it was on our must try list and was it a good decision.\n\nWe were brought iced teas quickly and they were refilled often during the night.  Then came bread service.  It was three kinds--cheese bread sticks, focaccia, and Italian bread.  We also got a dish with three potential bread toppings and for use during the meal--one container with olive oil, one with red pepper flakes, and one with grated cheese.\n\nOne of the runners brought us an amuse-bouche--two small bruschetta with freshly chopped tomatoes.  A nice palate awakener for what was to come.\n\nFor a starter, we order their salumi plate.  Our server, Alex, assured us it could be shared by two people.  The menu said that it was a selection of cured meats and red pizza.  Well, that sounded fine.  What came was almost a meal in itself.  Four kinds of cured meat, parmigiano cheese, and some fresh ricotta.  That wooden server was placed in front of us and then they placed a wood plate with red pizza.  Wow!  So much!  \n\nCured meat platter:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#rfBs4_87H9DVi5r3o0E_9A\n\nRed Pizza:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#a_Kw4-9-qjX9ROujm1IhHg\n\nWe also had another three compartment dish with mustard, olives, and pickled vegetables.  This was really starting to add up in the stomach and we hadn't gotten to the main course.  Everything was excellent.  We had to let two small pieces of pizza go back with the dishes.\n\nFor the main course, my wife got the Veal Nove which the menu describes as thinly sliced Scaloppine, Prosciutto, Arugula, and Lemon.  I tried a small piece and it was very, very good.  I ordered a special--lobster ravioli with a seafood sauce similar to lobster bisque.  It was superb!  There was a small amount of veal leftover and Alex and his crew quickly boxed it for bringing home.\n\nNow comes my pastry chef experience.  One of their desserts is Make Your Own Cannoli.  You get 5 small sized shells, a small, plastic pastry bag filled with the luscious cream that goes inside the cannoli, and a dish with nine compartments for dipping the ends of the cannoli.  The compartments had raspberry sauce, chocolate syrup, chocolate chips, coconut, butterscotch, toffee, pistachio, and chopped peanuts.  If you're counting and only got 8, it's because two of the wells had raspberry syrup.  \n\nTubes and pastry bag:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#sq32kg1eMJezCQzW7W2dTg\n\nDipping dish:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#uKRzAlaK3OKmX0AXS_L4cA\n\nLike my Yelp friends who work at Jean Philippe at Aria, I wielded that pastry bag like a surgeon uses his scalpel.  In no time whatsoever, I had completed my first cannoli with one side dipped in raspberry.\n\nSuccess:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nove-italiano-las-vegas?select=6aIiYFgxeFfOKehGuLTmhw#YFbqugc1i6Yt0wd4ibBihw\n\nMy wife, who hasn't been a fan of cannoli before tonight, ate three of them which left me with just two and I did all the work myself.  That's gratitude I'll tell you.  That dessert was fun and it's a clever menu item!\n\nService was excellent!  Alex and crew were always there to help, removed dirty plates, chat a bit, and do everything as well as they could which was very good!\n\nThe view, while not as good as Aliz\u00e9, is not bad.  I had a view of the original Palms Tower and being a local, I was studying the streets to figure out where the things in the area I know were located.\n\nThis was a very pleasant dinner!  I know I'll be back!  Oh, and I'll be calling Jean Philippe in the morning to check about pastry chef openings."
2,"This was supposed to be Las Vegas' latest and greatest club... I thoroughly enjoyed the sound and the vibe of the House floor, but it was so crowded that you couldn't dance let alone stand anywhere without it being shoulder to shoulder. We opt to say in the Hip Hop area that was equally as crowded, but luckily we found a small corner to dance in. After a while, we got even luckier as a girl invited us to dance in her table reserve area and Warren G performed. Being West Coast girls my group knew all the songs and had a great time watching his show. We left immediately after because it was just too packed for us.\n\nDon't buy bottled water b/c the small bottle costs $9 talk about rip off."
3,"It bothers me just a little that I happen to know who the best piano player is in Las Vegas and that Shaun DeGraff was playing with his band at the Mob Bar. A guy from outside of the \""702\"" shouldn't have this much information, but I do. People have called me \""The Boss\"" before, so maybe it's a bit of syndicate thing. \n\nMob Bar is located about a block from Fremont Street. The bar is pretty much inside  of the newly renovated Downtown Grand Hotel & Casino. As one might expect, there is a swanky mobster feel to the place. We walked in and lady luck snagged us a table near the band. As usual the music was good and our waitess was on top of things. Everyone seemed to be having a great time.  \n\nJust sitting in the classy Mob Bar, it is hard to fathom that you are merely a short block away from the madhouse on Fremont Street. Mob Bar is truly an island in a sea of madness. Mind you, once the music stopped, we relocated to Fremont Street with requisit Tall Boy beers in hand and a buzz that put us on a level playing field with just about everyone else.\n\nMob Bar is a classy little bar that is worth checking out if you're downtown."
3,"Went to this food truck at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest on 4/26. The gentelmen that was working the truck informed me that it was a local truck and they were launching to the public via the foodie fest. The truck was very clean and the prices seemed a bit high especially for launching day but I was eager to try it. I noticed that this food truck seemed to have some tyoe of rewards system setup where you scan a QR code i imagine to get a discount I didnt get much information on it of how to sign up the sign was just out there. The truck was very well fitted i saw that they had an entire POS system setup with a clear modem and all. The ipad had a square on it that allowed them to take credit cards and it also wirelessly printed the reciepts to a printer that was seup on the side, pretty trick for a food truck. I wanted to try the asian wrap but they were already sold out so we settled for da lobsta ballz and da pho-licious \""Q\"". Im not sure what it was but i felt like they lobsta ballz lacked something something to give them a kick or make the lobsta stand out. Da Pho-licious Q was really good however i found the pieces of meat to be a bit too big for a sandwhich that i truly wanted to share. \n\nI decided to re-try the food truck on saturday 4/27. I wanted to try the asian wrap again but again they were out of it. So this time we had da tofu nachos da meatballz and vegtable wa da pho. The tofu nachos were spectacular they made my wife and step son really like them and they are not tofu eaters at all. Da meatballz were also full of flavor and we're very tasteful. The pho was good too."
2,"The food we had was great, I really enjoyed everything we ordered. But we had a few issues. We were seated by the hostess at what looked like a bar table, people at the bar kept bumping into us. \n\nThe service was energetic, but too much. I may not have eaten at a Japanese Robata before but I have eaten at a restaurant before and I understand the concept of small plates and getting lighter dishes first and then moving on to heavier dishes. All of these concepts (and many more) were explained to us in great detail by our waiter, It was just too much.  He even told me I was eating one dish incorrectly.  He also told us in Japan its considered rude to use the wet cloths they bring out before the food for anything other than cleaning your hands.  Apparently, he was concerned we would take sponge baths in the dining room. So that was special.\n\n I really enjoyed the food itself but the waiter was way too much a part of our dinner, the noise was bad, drinks were slow, and we had no room.  I will go back for the food and that is the only reason I gave it 3 stars, but if we have the same waiter I will run for the door."
3,"Although I've never been here, I donate tons of stuff and it probably ends up here.  Once every couple of months I schedule a pickup on satruck.org.  The website is easy to use and you can pretty much pick any day you want to have them pick up your items.  I normally just put the stuff outside my door and they always show up as scheduled to pick it up.  I did have some larger items a few times and they do give you a window of a couple hours during which they will show up to take it out of your house.  They are normally on time but will cry like babies if the stuff is heavy or if there are stairs.  Their pickup people are normally pretty friendly but a few are sketchy.\n\nPart of me wishes that I wasn't so lazy and could sell some of the items on my own because what I donate is worth WAY more than I am allowed to write off of my taxes.  However, I guess it feels good to know that my stuff is being donated to a worthwhile cause."
2,"Scottsdale BBQ Company was our last stop in Scottsdale on the way out of town. We were driving to the airport when someone decided to look up a decent place for a late lunch. Scottsdale BBQ Company showed up in our Yelp search, and we decided to stop. \n\nIt was a warm Tuesday afternoon, about 4 pm, so naturally we had the run of the place. Aside from women heading to the tanning salon and teenagers revving their engines in the parking lot, the entire strip mall was empty. \n\nWe ordered the food at the counter inside and chose to seat outside. The outside seating area is a bit depressing, but it does remind you of the good ol' down home cookin'. The plastic tables with ratty checkered tablecloths clamped by old binder clips - you can't make that stuff up. Sitting on a plastic chair in the back of strip mall and watching a dog poop right in front of us (the owner did apologize) - what could be more authentic than that? \n\nI ordered their lunch special - 3 sliders (pork, brisket and chicken). It didn't come with any sides, but I decided to pay $1.65 apiece for Caesar salad and mac 'n' cheese. I also asked for a Diet Coke, which turned out to be a can with a cup of ice. BBQ takes time, so we were prepared to wait. Approximately 7 minutes passed, and two young ladies (the owners' daughters (?)) brought our food. My salad was OK, and so was my mac 'n' cheese. For $1.65, I thought both were a good value. The sliders were piled high with meat; however, they were not impressive. Pulled pork was tender and flavorful, but the brisket was dry as a bone. It was quite obviously overcooked and looked almost stale. It was dark and had a rough, chewy texture. No, thanks. The chicken was pretty bland, although it was mostly white meat. \n\nI went back inside for another Diet Coke and their dessert du jour, the peach cobbler. The cobbler had way too much cloves (allspice? something else?) in the filling, but the crust was really good. I spent $18 on the sliders, sides, 2 cans of soda and a cobbler. It's a lot of food and a lot of calories, but I wouldn't call it a cheap meal. \n\nSpeaking of calories, we burned a lot of them trying to put back the top on our rental Jeep Wrangler in the parking lot. \n\nQ: How many college educated baseball fans does it take to put the top back on the Wrangler? \nA: 5, even if they have an owner's manual, but still have no idea what the heck they're doing."
1,"I had TDS before and I will admit (and this is the reason for any stars), their internet is way faster.\n\nThat being said, watch what you sign.  We had a techincian fill out a form indicating that we had no invisible fence.  After realizing this we immediately called Charter and asked them to add a note to our account so the person burying the cable would not cut our fence.  As I'm sure you can guess, they just cut through it anyway.  I called, complained, and filed a claim.  Charter called me, told me to get it fixed and send over the invoice.  I did this, only to get a call and letter saying, just kidding we are denying this claim now.  They are just another criminal telecom company."
3,"Bad bingo is real fun and is like playing bingo in a night club but with fun prizes and funny games. This is a great time and is sure to entertain, yes the line is long because they fill the room with all the fun and games, try it you will like it. Bring back Lucky Break"
1,"I went here today for some coffee and maybe something to eat.  \n\nThe door was opened for me upon approaching it, and I was warmly greeted by a man who I assumed to be the owner.  That was awesome.\n\nGetting inside, there are children crawling around on the ground and on furniture, literally screaming... and it smells.\n\nI walked up to the counter and a girl said \""hi,\"" I said, \""hi,\"" and I looked  up at the menu to see what I wanted... I kept looking and kept thinking and she remained silent and just stared at me.... this is not the kind of service I expect at a coffee shop... maybe some suggestions, or questions... \""so is this your first time here?\"" would have been nice.  Just silence.\n\nI ended up just ordering a toddy, and it was okay.  I prefer the ones from Cartel most definitely though. \n\nI went to throw my straw wrapper away and the counter with forks and condiments and sugar and whatnot was visibly sticky and gross.  There was a bin with a sign over it reading \""dirty dishes,\"" that was indeed FILLED with dirty, smelly dishes.\n\nThe owner thanked me and said goodbye on my way out."
3,"OK, it's Subway so you get the general idea of the place.\n\nI am a fan of this particular location for a couple of reasons:\n\n1.  Parking - there is lots of it as it's next to a Bashas supermarket\n\n2. Lunch Prep - they always have around 5 sandwich artists at this location at lunch.  They draw a brisk lunch crowd but move through it quickly\n\n\n3, Ingredients - Their sandwich toppings are always fresh - never looked like they had sat out too long like some other places.\n\nThat's it!"
0,"Wow, band start and our server left twenty minutes later.  If you want quality food and any service, AVOID.  You want a bar that is under staffed and has holes in the restroom walls, this is your spot.  Band was great"
1,"Picked me up, not a selection of cars at all, and very slow"
1,"We've been there twice. Both times I've walked away unimpressed. The carnitas in the burritos are tasty, so is the chicken that comes in the burritos. However the overall experience is unremarkable. There's a salsa bar with several different types of bland salsa. The service, while really polite and warm is very slow. They have good servers there, just not enough of them. I kept noticing both times how my server was working just about every table I could see. \nAs for the cost, dinner for 2 plus tip, was about $30. I can get the same amount of food with meat every bit as tasty at Chipotle for $14. Considering the premium paid over that at Juan Jamie's, especially adding in slow service I don't think it's worth it."
2,"Oh my, this place is huge. The main entrance has the \""pick up section,\"" and totally reminds me of an airport arrival scene. \n\nSo in this gigantic store, they have everything!! Big selection of produce, meat, dairy, you name it - except garbanzo bean ... I don't know why my friend and I couldn't find it that night. We weren't even drunk. The prices of goods are cheap, too. I bought almost lifetime supply of paper towel for only $6.99. Yeay.\n\nAside from Woodman's huge selection on everything and prices being very cheap, I don't have too much to say. Oh wait! It's 24 hours open! That sounds convenient for grad students when they come home from their office late knowing that the fridge is nearly empty. \n\nI felt like it's a good Madison experience."
4,"Carl's Jr.....Good place for burgers.  I always enjoy their guacamole burger which is grubtastic!  ;)  This location is also pretty quick about serving their food especially when your on your lunch break which is an advantage over other locations I've been to.  Place is neat, clean, and staff are friendly.  :)"
2,The French dip was really good. Staff was pretty friendly until we had to ask for something they forgot to bring and then they didn't show up as much.
4,Best all you can eat around!
1,"I wish I could say more good things about this place but I was very disappointed.  Okay, the girls are pretty and there is a lot of TV's.  That's it.  The food is overpriced and not very good.  Same for the drinks.  Afterwards, my friends and I wished I went somewhere else.  Definitely over rated.  Hooter's would of been a better idea, lol.\nThe one bright spot was there was a guy in our group that I befriended that day.  He was a childhood friend of one of my buddies.  He ended up picking up the check which was over $200.  Thanks Dave."
0,"We have had dinner here in the past few years...Tonight 12/9/2013?\nDisappointed....PLEASE READ:\n\n1) Our server never introduced herself, kind of tacky when the server won't say their name and the place wasn't busy at all when we arrived.\n\n2) We have been to other Mimi's Cafe locations and was expecting to order from their array of dishes that we loved! I said to my wife, there is something different about the MENU given to us. It's NEW and limited options and the texture is what raised a red flag for me being the very observant one!\n\nShe said I was crazy...My wife asked the server were we given lunch menus? She said that is our normal menu and walked away. I questioned a SECOND time after my wife & friend agreed with me that there WAS something different. We got the attention of our server and she said, yes we have a new ownership and this is the selection they are going with.\n\n3) Gone are the Meatloaf, Chicken dishes! It's all geared toward FRENCH style food!\nEven the names of the NEW dishes have a FRENCH flavor ring to them.\n\nEX: La Granduer Burger etc...\n\n4) Since I was limited what I REALLY wanted, I settled for the $8.99 Burger with fries.\nI ADMIT it was a very good burger but NOT what I wanted at Mimi's. I asked for light on the Thousand Island sauce...it came dripping down the sides of the burger..within minutes was a soggy mess! I had to go thru several napkins and finished half of it using a fork & knife! Btw, was never asked HOW I wanted my burger cooked.,..\n\n5) The place wasn't busy at all when we arrived....We waited 20 minutes just to get our bread options, another 10 minutes after that to get our (3) entrees and ONE was a Large Salad. We questioned the server why it was taking so long? She said our dinners would be next out,waiting on french fries....(30 Minutes) to provide ONE LARGE SALAD, ONE Turkey Dinner & One La Grandeuer style burger in a non-busy location. I JOKING said they must have had to go kill & hunt down my burger!\n\nLuckily, it all arrived HOT and the salad was perfectly prepared for our friend  enjoyed it very much.\n\n6) Server gave us plenty of refills and was pleasant during our early dinner service.\n\n7) I NOTICED why the place was empty, due to the limited menu in my opinion.\nI also noticed quite a few seniors did arrive after us, but hardly any younger people having dinner & it was 6pm-630!\n\n8) Would I recommend? ER, Noooooooo... STAY away when there are other choices for quality food nearby....I cannot give it a TWO rating. maybe 1.5 is a better barometer for judgement..."
0,"DON'T EAT HERE!!!!! So, we ordered 3 things, 2 were terrible! My $18 salad had brown lettuce, literally. Brown. So I sent it back, the next one tasted just terrible. So I didn't eat any of the salad, just the chicken on top. At least they only charged me for the chicken, not the salad. Sweet potato fries were cold. Sent them back, the second batch was ok. Boyfriend's burger was ok. Also extremely loud and slow. :("
3,"This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Old Montreal, within a couple of blocks of Saint-Catherine shopping and the Place Des Arts.  I stayed here for one night on pleasure.  It's worth noting that I stayed with a Living Social coupon for $185/night plus tax, which is essentially 50% off.  I also know other travellers who have gotten a room for $200/night on Priceline.com.  I would NOT pay the $300-$350/night they ask on the website as full-price.\n\nThat being said, they gave us a beautiful, larger corner room.  There wasn't much view (other than the windows of adjacent buidlings), but the room was luxurious, with a nice, large washroom (including separate standing shower and bathtub).  Service was excellent, and I have no complaints.\n\nWhile people seem to complain about the expensive wifi, I was able to use wifi for free while in my room.  It switched to a pay-policy when in the lobby or restaurants.  Not sure why...\n\nThe hotel also has a fantastic restaurant (Osco!), and a fun absinthe bar (Sarah B.).\n\nI would recommend this restaurant, assuming you can get a deal on the room price."
1,"You have to try pretty hard to mess up chicken shawarma, but these guys do it in spades. Every place I've ever had chicken shawarma, its made from chicken breast that's been roasted in and sliced from a shawarma cooker. This place however, uses cut chunks of thigh meat full of grisel and connective tissue. Seriously disgusting. And don't bother with a salad unless you like it swimming in dressing."
0,"Terrible service & charged me for ceramic brakes, but only gave me lower-quality semi-metallic brakes. After I went to another mechanic to discover the problem, Fletchers still wouldn't fix the problem."
3,"The line was very long but it was worth the wait. The service was good too. Our waiter was helpful and fast. \nLove the restaurant's entrance with fire inside the glass. We had to take a picture in front of it. \nThe food was great, my favorite were the Truffle Parmesan Fries and I highly recommend them. We first started with the Jalape\u00f1o Popper Shots. I love spicy food but I don't know if it was cause I was drinking on a empty stomach or my Acid Reflux; but they were very spicy and gave me heartburn. I did enjoy the ranch sauce that you dip the poppers in, it was very yummy, refreshing, and helped with the heat of the popper. Next we got ours Burgers and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. The fries were so delicious. I love Parmesan cheeses and these fries were top with lots of it. I order the American Burger. It was very good but I wanted well done. Still good and juicy. \nOverall I would highly recommend trying Gordon Ramsay BurGR and I will be coming back when I'm in Las Vegas."
1,"At most buffets I at least leave feeling full, unfortunately I can't say the same for this one.  While there is a large quantity of different food options, the quality makes many of those options inedible.  There were a few different things that I was able to eat but for the most part I filled up on the desserts and not the actual food."
2,"Went in for a quick lunch time mani, the lady didn't speak much but was polite and friendly. Overall she did a good job but I was very dispointed that I was charged 20.00 for a basic manicure."
1,"We dined here for dinner on Thanksgiving Day with our good friends that were visiting from Hawaii. I don't know where to begin, but this place was such a disaster.\n\nService was horrible and slow. Extremely slow. So it was Thanksgiving night and they were busy, but it wasn't a full house in the restaurant. Our server (I guess I'll be nice and not mention his name) was never around. I think we only saw him 3 times. The first time was when he took our orders. Then he disappeared for an hour. We also waited over an hour for our food. He finally zoomed passed us right before we got our food, and then WE had to flag him down to get some drinks. The third time, he brought us the bill. Horrible. The guy who refilled our waters provided better service! \n\nThe food wasn't too great in my opinion. The bread that they served us in the beginning was too hard and the butter was pretty frozen. I ordered the center cut Filet Mignon. The glaze on top of it was tasty, but the rest of the steak lacked flavor. It was also kind of dry. The bottom line: it needed salt. I also ordered the seasoned jumbo steak fries as my side. The seasoning made them taste weird. I couldn't really figure out was it was but it did leave a spicy after taste. The steak knives that they gave us were very dull as well. My husband and one of our friends ordered the dry-aged New York Sirloin. They both said it needed salt. Our other friend ordered the queen cut prime rib and enjoyed it. So at least one of us liked our food. \n\nFYI - the bathroom is a hoax! You open the first door with a sign that says \""restrooms.\"" Then it leads you to a second door with a sign that says \""restrooms.\"" When you open that door, it leads you to the nearby restrooms in the casino. LOL.\n\nThe bottom line: Not recommended and the steaks need salt. You know its bad when you have to have salt, A1, ketchup, and whatever else to make your steak edible!"
1,Super fast delivery.\nOnly Chinese place that offer wings & fries combo.\nBest french fries I've ever had except at fast food places.\n\nUpdate: I don't know why I said the stuff above. Their food... sucks!
0,"This place is the definition of a flea bag hotel. The person who took the pics on the choice website should be both charged w/fraud and given a raise by hotel management as the room I was in and the lobby look NOTHING as pictured. They are supposedly renovating the place, but goodness knows when that will happen. The place might have been nice when it was built in the 70s, but its glory days are long gone. It also has a super weird layout.\n\nMy room was two doubles because they were out of kings and thankfully I only needed the one bed because the other was completely stripped down to the mattress w/the bedding laying on top of the dresser. I called down to the front desk to be put in another room, but the place was full, which shocked me, but apparently their core business is airline employees.\n\nNeedless to say I the place just felt dirty and I was afraid to touch anything in my room. Sleeping in the bed was agony because I had ideas of bedbugs running through my head.\n\nThe only reason this place is getting 1-star is because they had a decent bfast and the girl at check in was nice, as was the shuttle driver, however the other girl who answered the phone needs to take a customer service and attitude adjustment refresher course!\n\nEither way, steer clear of this pit!"
2,"It's hard to chase down a late night food truck when you have a little bugger.  But finally, I get to try Fukuburger!  Does it live up to the hype?\n\nFAME at The Linq (where Fukuburger is located) is a glorified food court with lots of graphic art creating a hip and vibrant space.  Fukuburger is immediately visible with their faux truck in the corner.  I think the other tenants may be suffering from the lack of visibility or even a guide on what is offered inside.\n\nOk back to Fuku... Let's start off with the burger and togarashi fries.  Unfortunately this was a miss for us.  We got the Buta burger with bacon, cheese, pickled onion and ginger, bbq sauce and wasabi mayo.  The burger patty was small, and the fries were stale.  What we were served (and service took long even if the place wasn't packed) looked very different from the food shots I see from the Fukuburger truck.  Somehow the magic is a little lost in the permanent spot.\n\nBut the Naga Dog, wow, that was stellar, even if the bread was a little stale.  The hot link was smoky and savory and had a lovely snap when you bit into it because it is deep fried.  It comes with awesome grilled kimchi (which is a little wilted but the caramelization from the grill tames the tangy bite).  The stuff is spicy but exceptionally good!  It is complemented by the pickled daikon relish.  What a creative and successful alternative to onions!  Then the hot dog is topped with nori (which I wish I had more of) and wasabi mayo.  Mmm.  I read that it's supposed to come with kabayaki (eel) sauce, but I didn't get any on mine.  Even if I am not a huge fan of sweet on savory, I think it would have gelled beautifully with the spicy elements on the hot dog.  Still, I really enjoyed how they balanced all those elements successfully.  Maybe if I scoot over to the truck I'll get the perfect version.\n\nFor tourists on the strip, I believe it would be a convenient sop that does the job (even if it is pricier by around $2-3 per menu item).  But if you want a little more love on your plate, I'd hunt down that food truck."
0,"This updated review is a direct reflection of the massage portion of my recent visit to Just For You.  My best friend was in town so we decided to treat ourselves to the Half Day Package. I provided this feedback and after a week, I have heard nothing.  I have amended some content due to character limits here: \n\n     I was so pleased with Heather's technique (during the facial portion of the appointment) and the session was a raging success from my perspective.  I was extremely relaxed when my facial was over and I was invited into the massage room by Allison.  \n\n     As a Licensed Massage Therapist myself, I do have some expectations for a massage session and understand every therapist is different and no two sessions are the same. Unbeknownst to me, my best friend had already told Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist; I did not share with Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist myself and I did not know that she had already been told.  I did not want her to feel like I would be \""testing\"" her in any way. With that in mind, I climbed onto the quite high massage table and settled in for what I was hoping would be a therapeutic session as \""Allison specializes in stress reduction, sports massage, and relaxation massage.\""  I work two jobs and had not received bodywork in almost a year.  \n\n     I can best summarize the session by sharing that Heather had a more therapeutic and relaxing touch than Allison did.  Allison talked for the first 10 minutes of what turned out to be a 45 minute (not an hour) session.  She seemed more interested in my main job title than in seeking feedback about her pressure.  Not wanting to jump the gun and to ensure I provided her ample time to check in regarding the pressure, I waited.  Allison proceeded to tell me by back was \""loosening up nicely\"" which was not an accurate statement in the least.  Allison kept moving over an area that was tense due to a poor sleeping position days earlier, something had I mentioned mid-session, and instead of applying direct pressure to ease that tension, she caused soreness and inflammation with the repeated palpation of the site.  After having me move into a supine position, Allison proceeded to begin an abdominal massage that felt very awkward and insecure.  To successfully conduct an abdominal massage, a towel or cloth heavier than the sheet already on the body should be used over the chest so when the sheet is pulled toward the feet to expose the abdomen, the client does not feel exposed.  Ideally, a conversation would have been had with the client regarding the area as it is not typically an area of the body where most people are comfortable receiving bodywork.  I am trained and experienced in abdominal massage and I found myself questioning what was happening before I realized that abdominal work was next.  Courtney shared with me that she, too, had felt awkward during this part of the session as she felt like she was just having her stomach rubbed and didn't really understand the purpose of the technique.  She also shared that she had asked Allison for more pressure during her session and Allison complied, providing more pressure for about a minute and then resuming her previous technique.    \n\n     To make matters more awkward, when we were at the front desk waiting to pay for our services, Allison stood there waiting for payment.  Heather and the other staff member at the desk were on the phone and Courtney and I were happy to wait for them to finish.  Allison even made mention that she didn't know how to finalize the payment portion of the visit but then attempted anyway, losing patience with the two servicing the clients on the phone.  When she was able, Heather apologized for the wait and we honestly had no issue waiting our turn.  When Allison decided to conduct the payment collection herself, I explained to her that we had had a package session that day.  She then gave us the total of $139 when the package price was $135.  I corrected her, even showing her the package I had already mentioned in the brochure, and she accepted our payments for $135.  It was only when it came time for us to add our tips and sign our receipts that Allison seemed to have an interest in our sessions and how we were feeling.  At that point, I just wanted to leave.  I was so utterly disappointed and honestly felt like I had wasted the money that paid for the massage portion of the package as there was nothing relaxing or therapeutic about what transpired during that session.  As we were leaving, Allison reminded us to \""drink lots of water\"" and I thought to myself, \""For what?\""  She didn't do anything that promoted a need for water in addition to what I already consume. \n\n     I wanted to bring my experience to your attention as I truly feel that, although her technique may be appreciated by some, it has confirmed that I will not be booking another massage session at Just For You."
4,"Very good food!! A nice, clean and very friendly place. Prices are reasonable for authentic Mexican food. We have eaten there many times and always look forward to going back."
0,"Although we typically do not like buffets we tried this, thinking that since it is at the Wynn, it would be good.  The only thing that was half way decent was the pastries.  Everything else was typical dry, cold, and crappy buffet food."
2,"This place is OK.  Shoes must be taken off before you come inside.  Staff was really, really friendly and that was nice.\n\n\nRooms are RIGHT by the kitchen which can be annoying/noisy.  Also gets FREEZING in here at night."
4,"I went to Carolinas Vision Group on a refer from Minute Clinic when I scratched my eye. The staff was very courteous and got me in to see the Dr immediately. His focus opwas making me feel better, and controlling the amount of pain I was in. I have never been to such a professional and caring eye doctor. I already scheduled my annual eye exam! I would highly recommend!"
1,"It's just ok.  At first, the food tasted pretty good, but as we settled into the meal we found it to be quite greasy.  In fact, my wife got sick from the meal while I only had an upset stomach.  I think we'll have to find another place."

Don't take my word for it....just try it for yourself and I think you will see things from a Different Pointe of View as well. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
2,"This is the only hotel I've stayed at downtown - I know, hard to believe a person from Hawaii never stayed at the California!!  But I'm really picky about what hotels I stay at and the California and every other hotel located downtown always made me feel itchy while walking through - like I said before: \""Happy Faye, happy stay!\""\n\nThe rooms were pretty average, but I only stayed in their standard rooms.\n\nI've had good experiences here and never felt unsafe (while in the hotel room and casino area).  All of the employees were always nice and helpful, which is always good to have!  Their 24 hour coffee shop serves good food at reasonable prices (they even have some \""Hawaii friendly\"" menu items!)."
4,"psssst.... c'mere...... let me let you in on something kinda cool.  Medizona might be the best restaurant you've never heard of.  I mean, really, how is this place not huge?!   I don't have the descriptors to let you know how much I like this place.  \n\nThe food here is creative, attractively presented and fantastic on the palate.  It's southwestern and mediterrenean.  Yeah, \""huh?\""  I know.  I had the same reaction.  It's like Chino Bandido, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't sound like it'd work, but it does.  Go try it for yourself.   Ratatouille quesadilla.  Chorizo potato cake.  Lamb with a moussaka tart with red pepper sauce. And, of course, the prickly pear tiramisu.\n\nGo. \n\nTonight."
3,"as the end of my third decade approached, i started to panic... how do i gracefully breeze through yet another milestone birthday with grace and style??  last year's nyc festivities were a trump card punctuated by le bernadin, but this year...it had to be bigger, better, faster, more.  what better place to indulge in excess than the city of sin, so away i went (with friends in tow) to celebrate the end of an era.  beyond the obligatory vices of vegas, my sights were sent on visiting jo\u00ebl robuchon, whom gault millau deemed chef of the century and michelin bequeathed the only three star rating between the east and west coasts. dressed in nothing less than my big pink quincea\u00f1era dress (because 15 x 2 seems much less daunting than a big bloated 30), i buckled in for a ride of four courses and accompaniments.  the french are experts at throwing in extra flair to make a girl feel special, and highlights included a formidable bread cart, surprise g\u00e2teau de c\u00e9l\u00e9bration, and let's not forget the special raspberry-pistachio pound cake parting gift  just for the ladies. oh, and did i mention the fernet & coke that kicked off the festivities?  of course i didn't need to, it's a prerequisite pour tout les joyeux anniversaires."
2,"Curse me and my bad memory!!! For the life of me, I could not remember what the off-menu tasty order was! ANIMAL STYLE - it will forever burn in the back of my mind and I will have to venture back to In-N-Out Burger the next time I am on the West Coast so I can truly try the burger the right way! \n\nI got a single and the BF got a double and we shared an order of fries.  For how cheap it was, less than $10 for our meal, it was a stand out burger, way better than McDonald's or any other similar fast food burger joint.  As a burger, it was not the greatest, albeit I know I need to update my review once I try it animal-style.  \n\nRegardless, I was so happy that we got to stop here on our way to the Hoover Dam.  Oh - the shakes are yummy! We got chocolate - Mmm mmm."
4,great deep dish pizza and this is from an ex Chicagoan.  Casual surroundings and pleasant servers.  Their salads are XL and recommend the house dressing.  Deep dishes naturally take longer to make so call in and order before you show up even for dine in.
1,"Went there for dinner on Monday night.  Not real impressed.  The place is not much larger than a Golden Corral.  Being sort of cheap I usually stay at Excalibur and at least once each stay go to the buffet.  Last Christmas I decided to spend an extra $5 and try the buffet at the Luxor and was well rewarded.  So this year I opted to spend yet another $5 ($26.99 +tax) to see what it got me.  Last year at the Luxor was much better.  Very small salad bar. Limited cooked vegetables.  Several meat and starch dishes, almost all were cold or lukewarm.  Several of the seafood items (hot and cold) were soggy.  I did leave room for dessert and it was very good.  This place has all the pieces in place to be good and they just are not pulling it off well.  They have several seafood offerings, they use smaller warming trays so they get changed out more often which should keep food warm and not dried out.  I ate between the opening rush and the 7PM dinner rush so the place was only about 80% full and the lines were reasonable.  My server kept my plates cleared and my Iced tea full.  I did notice this trip the entire MGM family seems to be cutting back on quality and value compared to when I was there in July."
0,"I should have known when I walk in, only 2 tables with people on them in the whole restaurant. It was a point to turn around and walk out but I did not. I wished I did 40 dollars for 3 rolls that were average at best. Whole foods are better if you ask me then  third of the price as well, I must not be the only person as the place was empty.\nDon't waste your time.\nI love Japanese food but this was a joke."
0,"Ok, went her last weekend because a friend of mine had heard good things about it. I know it from hearing about the West Hollywood location (popular celeb hangout, good food, etc.). We went here on a Saturday night and it wasn't all that busy (dinner was at 8 p.m.) Everything started out fine until we were waiting for our food and one of our guests spotted something interesting behind our booth, which was up against one of the walls of the restaurant. WTF??? Why was there a MASSIVE RAT TRAP behind our booth? (Picture to come) Is this place hiding something we don't know? That is absolutely disgusting. To top it off, our MINIATURE SIZED entree's came. Wow, this place is more of a rip off. My friend had the chicken yakitori (pint size chicken skewers). Wow $16! I had the hamachi ($22). Don't get me wrong, the food was pretty good but the price of the food certainly does not match the service of the place. Our waitress was at times horrible. My friend asked for a bottle of wine, which she was quoted as saying was between $29 and $35. She never came back to confirm that price and then she had the audacity to charge $48 for that bottle. She also added one too many orders of a bottle of sake. This place is just all wrong. I wouldn't bother wasting your money there."
2,"Hungry and exhausted from a day of touring the city, my boyfriend and I stumbled from the nearest Bixi station into this New York Times-recommended French bistro. We had a 10:00pm reservation (the earliest slot available on Opentable that summer Saturday) and were eternally grateful when they could seat us at 9:30pm. To our surprise, the restaurant was far from packed, although outdoor seating was mostly taken.\n\nThe food was really good. We didn't order any entrees; Instead, we got the charcuteries platter (good to share between two people), which included duck rillettes (divine with caramelized onion), foie gras terrine, cured ham, and pork saucisson. Some of the charcuteries were only ok, but some were amazing too... The foie gras rivaled the pate at NYC's Bar Boulud. Additionally, we ordered two corns on the cob (light, simple, delicious with butter and salt/pepper) and a side of fries (very tasty). Our meal ended up being approx $70 with a glass of beer.\n\nAs far as French bistro cuisine goes, Brasserie T definietely succeeded in the charcuterie. However, there are little things about the ambiance and service that threw our experience off.\n\n- First, we were seated at a table with no tabletop candle or overhead light. It was so dim that we couldn't read our menus. We requested a table change and got moved to a window table that had a harsh overhead white light (compared to the soft yellow lighting other tables got). Slightly annoyed but too embarrassed to request another table change, we stayed put. But it elicited grumbles from my boyfriend.\n- Second, it took foreeeeeever to flag our server down for the check. It was as if she forgot about us after our orders were put in.\n\nBased on the hype (from the Toque connection and NYT review) and menu prices, I had certain expectation about the restaurant as an overall experience. Brasserie T tried to meet those expectations, but it fell just short. Certainly not bad but certainly not amazing."
3,"I love this place! The food tastes great- I like  that they have a whole bean burrito with avocado slices in it.  Their iced tea is good too.Plus they sell a great refillable cup and you get a much cheaper drink when you bring it with you. I use the cup all the time too at my desk. They also recently started using regular plates and silverware in the restaurant, reducing trash.  love when chain restaurants do this. It shows that you can still make a profit and reduce waste.\n\nYou can also call in your order and use the drive thru window to pick it up. that's convenient!\n\nThe only reason I dropped off a star on the rating is this- if you order food there you get a side of chips included. If you order food to go you have to pay for the side of chips. What the heck is that about?"
1,"I'm torn between the quality product and the poor service and WiFi.  \n\nThe coffee is exceptional but the entry fee (getting past the flaming hoops of attitude) to get your coffee is a little high.  Now I guess I'm one of the cool kids at times (working for the man - Buring Man), but unless that comes up in conversation, most often I'm not dressed the part in my business casual and just another target for the staff.\n\nBeyond the slow service and attitude, the WiFi is crap.  They are riding a signal from a neighbor companies (Wet Paint) router.  I wish they'd get their own router and Cox connection!  Hell I'd even set it up for them, and when I suggested putting a WiFi tip jar the customers at the bar were all for it!\n\nI like the location and the product but not the service and WiFi - both things that can be fixed."
4,"Fantastic buffet! The atmosphere is a little like Alice in Wonderland with fake colorful flowers and bright lights. The employees have unusual costumes that are a bit hard to explain. But the food is spectacular. I really appreciated all of the salad, vegan  and vegetarian options. The day I went, they had two different quinoa dishes! I was very impressed. The buffet is a bit pricy for dinner, but I would highly recommend it."
3,"Wow! I can't believe I've been buying beer from the pathetic selection at Sainsburys when this little gem of a convenience store has been here all along. The great thing about this place is the copious beer selection: Black Isle, Cairngorm, Erdinger, lots of other German and Scottish beers, and some American ones. Not cheap, but quality."
2,"3.5 STARS although I probably would've given them 3 if not for my most recent visit.  During better times, the seafood buffet was the bomb!  Long lines to get in and plenty of choices to choose from when getting to the seafood choices.  This time, no line to get in at 7pm on a Saturday night!  \n\nOne thing I love is getting a butter shrimped scampi or cleaned peeled shrimp with cocktail sauce. What did I see?  Cleaned but unpeeled shrimp!  Come on!  I'm on vacation!  You want me to peel shrimp?  \n\nHaving been here a couple of times, I had noticed that the \""seafood\"" in seafood buffet has dwindled a bit.  When I took a look at what they offered, I can see that maybe 55-60% of the buffet was seafood with the remaining part offering meat or other cuisines that offered meat dishes or seafood dishes.  The shrimp dumpling that they had wasn't so great...I've had better.Their baja included fajitas and things didn't impress me.  However their pork spareribs were unexpectedly awesome.\n\nThere are so many ways to prepare seafood dishes.  For example, I'd love to see if they could had made something inspired from the South or maybe something done Asian style like with miso.  Instead we got a couple of baked seafood items and the usual array of deep fried calamari, clam strips, and shrimps.\n\nI made sure to not forget about dessert.  The gelato selection that they have over there is excellent!  I had the blueberry cheesecake gelato and it rocked my world.  They also had the Elvis, peanut butter/jelly/banana!  No thanks...I'm not ready to channel Elvis after a full meal like that.\n\nFor $48, I hoped to have the same experience as before.  They really need to change things up a bit.  During my meal, I was having one of those cravings for a Red Lobster like cheesy biscuit.  When you're thinking of Red Lobster while at a Vegas seafood buffet, then you know something is amiss here.  \n\nI'd definitely come back if they looked into making their seafood buffet more focused to what they advertise."
0,"Do not visit this location.  I had my truck towed here after it lost all power, after six days they still had no clue what was going on but had insisted that the only way that they could diagnose the problem was to spend $500 on plugs and wires.\n\nAfter 6 days I paid for a second tow to take it somewhere else where within a couple hours they had diagnosed the problem, correctly as a broken valve spring and thrown valve.\n\nPaul and Alex are very poor technicians.  They should not be allowed to work on your car except to do oil changes and change tires."
3,"An absolutely beautiful mansion sitting on the top of Pinckney overlooking the capital building and the rest of the city. We went over a 4th of July weekend in the summer so prices were jacked way up. Honestly, for what we paid, I can't say MHI was worth it. But looking at their standard rate card, prices seem to improve during regular days (although regardless they seem more like Chicago prices than Madison prices to this Chicago-ite)\n\nWe arrived in the afternoon and had to ring a doorbell to gain admittance. This was a standard procedure every time we came back: guests do not receive a key to the exterior door and someone is up 24/7 to let you in. When we walked in, there was a beautiful bar and sitting area to our left, and a lounge with fireplace to our right. We were shown our room which was an \""english basement\"" style room. Not too much light, but nicely appointed, frette sheets, aveda bath products, a heated bathroom floor, and terry cloth robes. A small desk, sitting chair, large bureau, a chest of drawers, and 42\"" flat screen completed the decor. Oh, and a huge picture of Lance Armstrong. Huh? Yeah, turns out Trek the bike company owns the whole place, oddly enough. So don't be surprised when you see B&W biking pictures everywhere. \n\nAnyways, the bed was extremely comfortable and we heard absolutely no noise the entire time we were in our room despite the Inn having several other occupants. The staff were quite pleasant and helpful when we hung out in the lounge, making us feel quite welcome and comfortable with a never ending supply of nuts and candy, and eating (the included) continental breakfast on the deck off the lounge was a nice experience. \n\nThe Inn overall is beautifully decorated; think lots of marble, wood, and restored tile. And a wonderful circular staircase up the middle of the house. I wouldn't do the lower floor room again though (room 3.) It was dead quiet, but also dark and a little gloomy. They pitched us specifically on that room vs. another because it was larger, but I'd rather have light than a few extra square feet the next time."
1,Terrible service. Mediocre food.
4,"I went to Bound by Salvatore for a late night stop.  All I have to say is that this bar is perfect for me.\n\nLots of plush seating, friendly bartenders and wait staff, very unique cocktail menu, and it's a really great spot for people watching at The Cromwell.\n\nSince I like to stay up late in Vegas, my favorite part of their cocktail menu is that they have some really good espresso cocktails!  They're perfect for when you've had a long night on the Strip but want to keep it going just a while longer.\n\nThe \""Never Say Goodnight\"" --  http://bit.ly/1mn6TUe\nRed Bull Flavored Espresso, Stole Vanil Vodka, Perond Absinthe, Sugar Syrup and Spices\nJust by reading the ingredients alone you can tell this is a serious wake-up drink.  This definitely kept my night going and the taste of this cocktail was pretty good!\n\nI will definitely be coming back here again next time I visit Vegas."
3,Typical downtown Starbucks -nice seating and the fact they have free wi if is always a good thing! Within walking distance of businesses very. Busy-friendly staff and always accurate orders with fresh ingredients
3,"Pros and Cons of our visit to Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant. \n\nPros\n*Food was really tasty. \n*Nice menu with lots of pictures and unique items. \n*Large portions of food at affordable prices. \n* Food was very tasty!\n\nCons\n*Poor service, (I'm only rating my visit) \nWait staff just seemed uninterested/unfriendly. But this is Vegas. What did I expect. \n\n\nSummary\n I'd go back lots of yummy looking food pictured on the menu I did not order today."
3,"Pricy, but not so much compared to other things on the Strip, and it tasted pretty good."
3,"How can you go wrong with Hickory Tavern? Just don't get the Tennessee Lemondae, unless you like weak drinks."
1,"Ambience is great. Love the band and dj on Friday and Saturday nights. Food is ok. The service, however, is horrible. Been going there for a few years and the service keeps getting worse (with the exception of Mike)."
2,"Their claim to fame seems to be the pollo fundido.  To that I say, I've had better.  While inexpensive, the fundido was a little salty and could have used more flavor, but all and all, not a waste of time. :). Salsa and chips are free for eat ins, and the salsa is yummy.  As for the best pollo fundido, I recommend Julio G's in Scottsdale and PV."
1,"I have been looking for a bakery ever since we moved to Las Vegas. I was really excited when Freeds opened up near my house as I have heard nothing but good things about it. I walked in today looking for something special for dessert and I have to say that I wasn't really that impressed. I ended up picking up two pieces of cake. One was Black Forrest (my favorite) and the other was Red Velvet (my GF's favorite) and I have to say that I have had better. The Black Forrest tasted too much of the Fake Cherry they used and the Red Velvet was really dry and kind of blah. \n\nI will say they make better cakes then Albertsons, Vons or Smiths... but I am sure that if I keep looking there is someone else out there who makes better cakes then what I sampled at Freeds. \n\nAs for the customer service, they seemed fine to me. Everyone seemed to be fascinated with the photographing of a couple of wedding cakes that to me looked a little plain, but its not my wedding so who cares. \n\nI would give it a try, maybe you like it better then me but growing up in a little Danish town with tons of great Danish bakeries to choose from I totally expected more from Freeds."
0,"Went to WCG on Saturday with my family. My daughter eats anything, my son does not eat red meat and I don't eat any meat/flesh.  I was very disappointed to find the only thing that I could eat, other than a green salad, was a side of broccoli and a side of summer corn salad.  The veggie burger has walnuts which makes it hard for someone with nut allergies.  The House Special Tomato soup has bacon cooked in it and the couscous has pistachios on it.  Making it through the meal, we ordered dessert. We were again disappointed.  The Silky Chocolate Souffle' Cakes was neither silky nor souffle'.  It was more like a dense brownie cake.  The French White Chocolate Bread Pudding was burned on the bottom and I suppose the Fresh Apple Pie was good, my son at it all, but I couldn't taste it because it too had nuts in it.  Please, when making your menu, consider customers who may have allergies or desires to eat or not eat meat.  I will not be back to WCG unless some changes are made to their menu."
2,"Their food is fine. Their prices are too high for what you get. I won't go out of my way to eat there but if I'll be in the neighborhood and  have the craving for this kind of food, I'll eat there again."
2,"The food was quite good and the service was OK. So why only three stars? Well, when I pay upwards of $40+ for a meal, I want something that's better than just \""good.\"" My veal was just not that great. I think if I had ordered something else I might be giving them a higher star count, but I have to base my review on my experience.\n\nOh yeah, and they were \""out\"" of the special for the day (salmon something or the other). So, if you're in the Bellagio and want a nice meal, I wouldn't avoid this place, I just think you can get more for your money if you hit one of the \""actual\"" restaurants in the hotel-casino."
4,DW Bistro is amazing! The food is delicious & the staff is super friendly & polite. The different cocktails they serve are always quite savory. I have been here numerous times & I don't get tired of the vegetable curry with couscous. The tingy v is also my favorite cocktail. The menu here is quite different than other places & that is a good thing because they have a wide selection of food & vegetarian options. This place deserves beyond 5 stars!!!
2,Over-rated in a town where you can get better buffet food at a much lower cost. Long lines are not worth the wait. Look elsewhere
0,"Horrible location and average food, it not worth the effort trying to find it. This place is located in an industrial area downtown and looks more an abandoned shack that's deteriorating for the last 30 years than a restaurant. It was so bad that I thought it was closed until I saw people inside. So I tried it and was quit disappointed. The menu is VERY limited and they charge gourmet prices for bar quality food. Don't waste your time and money."
3,"The two times that I have randomly dined at this Bravo has been on Wednesday evening. Yay for Martini Wednesdays!! It's always a great surprise when they plop that menu on your table. All of Bravo's Martinis are only $5 on Wednesday evenings, and they have several good options.\n\nThe food is very dependable. I most recently ordered the Pasta Woozie as my entree. It was just the right portion size - large enough to really fill me up but small enough that I wasn't taking a mound of noodles home as leftovers.\n\nI look forward to dining at this Bravo again and hope that I remember to come back on Wednesday!"
0,I was surprised the food showed up so quickly but then I realized it was probably sitting out for an hour or so earlier. The wings were bone cold. The pastrami sandwich was almost as cold. Here's the kicker. How can you screw up water. The water we ordered could not be consumed. It tasted like it had chemicals in it. If I end up with a tumor I'll know it was because of this place. Do not enter. Drive down the street a bit further and try your luck somewhere else. I am not sure why this place was rated so high. My guess is that their taste buds were burned off in the intense Arizona heat.
0,"Took my husband here before our show at the Venetian. Had high expectations, especially considering the expensive price for a Vegas restaurant. I had the bone marrow ravioli which the waiter recommended. It had a funny taste to it and I didn't like it. Maybe it's an acquired taste? Moved on to my pasta. I ordered the black pasta, since the waiter said it is the same thing as squid ink pasta. I've had the authentic thing in Venice, Italy and this was definitely not it! For one it tasted like regular pasta. The one in Venice had a slightly briny seafood taste to it which made it unique compared to regular pasta, and B&B's did not. Also, I couldn't believe how salty and spicy the pasta was. Is squid ink pasta supposed to leave a burning sensation in your mouth? I don't think I'll be coming back here."
2,"Fatburger provides a solid quick-service style burger open 24 hours on the Strip right across the street from the Monte Carlo. \n\nWhen I went there you could choose from small through XXXL for the burger size. I heard from a friend that their used to be only 3 sizes. I think that kind of simplicity would have be nice since I was quite baffled about which size to order. The burgers are all cooked to order which is nice but may cause a little bit of a wait. Cheese, chili, bacon, and egg are all chargable upgrades for the burger while other condiments are available for no additional charge. \n\nI was talked into the medium size burger. I added cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. It was too big. I got to the awkward point in my meal where I was satisfied to be done eating but only had a little bit of burger to go. I decided to avoid feeling the gut bomb and just tossed it. Along with my burger I ordered the skinny fries which turned out were not really all that skinny. I mean, they were pretty much standard size fries. I think I would have been better off if I topped them with chili or ordered the fat fries or onion rings instead. Lesson learned.\n\nAll in all, it is a decent option for late night eats. Especially if you want to avoid the more notorious fast food burgers, and of course, you have at least $10 to burn on a quick bite."
1,"Pizza is nothing special. Canned mushrooms, spinach, and shrimp. Sauce and cheese ordinary. We will not go back"
4,"Service and food is as good as it gets in a steakhouse. Pricing for Wagyu steak is fair, $90 for a 32 oz piece that two could share. Crabcake with Cajun sauce was delicious, but only one crabcake in the appetizer portion. The bread was nothing to write home about. The steak was the star of the evening, perfectly seasoned and prepared. We were licking the bone! They had prisoner by the glass, one of our favorite wines. Perhaps next time I would order the rib eye bone-in steak because the Wagyu, though melt-in-the-mouth tender, had too much fat for my liking."
0,"WORST HOTEL IVE EVER STAYED AT IN VEGAS!!!!\n\nFirst, housekeeping stole a $100 bill out of my wallet when they did the turn down service (i dont gamble so I know I didn't spend my $$) \n\nSecond, my key was deactivated about 15 times during my 4 night stay and the keys wouldnt even work when I would go down to the concierge and ask for a replacement so every time I wanted to get into my room I was at the mercy of security to let me into my own room. This was extremely inconveniencing at 2pm, 5pm, and 2am especially when security took their sweet time (upwards of 30 minutes) to let me into my room. \n\nTHEN, after I complained, one of the managers said I could have a $40 room credit which I planned to use on room service after I had gotten off work. I ordered a SALAD at 12am hoping it would arrive in an hour...no. Two hours later, I called to cancel my order because I was going to bed...starving. \n\nFinally after that charade happened, I left a dress in another room. I called 2 weeks later wondering if it had been turned into lost & found. Immediately the lady on the other line said it wasn't there and they only keep items for 14 days. Remind you, she hadn't asked what my checkout date was or for a description of the dress. So rude. I never wish a stay at the Aria upon anyone. Its aesthetically pleasing but the customer service is worse than Circus Circus. A bunch of selfish clowns who could care less about their consumer."
1,"Two stars because the service was nice. But that food was EXPENSIVE and it tasted blan and horrible! Make sure if you order eggs you order real eggs, otherwise they serve your powdered or syrup eggs. \n\nBut the only reason we ate here is cause we were hungry. But the bill ended up being over $40 and we didn't even order drinks... Just water. If it's possibly for you then I suggest avoiding this place.\n\nThe only good thing I remember about this place was the PBR was descent price compared to everywhere else in the hotel. $5 for 16oz $13 for 60oz pitcher."
3,"I've found myself having a swift couple in here on a number of occasions, despite it not really being near any other nightlife, and the fact I've never lived anywhere nearby. I'm not sure the reason behind it's seemingly magnetic appeal, it's just a regular locals pub. Reasonable prices, busy for sports, with the usual pub grub and middle aged decor.\n\nIt almost, but not quite, loses a star due to the regular presence of rugby fans. This shower are the main reason I've never chose to permanently locate in Edinburgh, and their presence in The Haymarket is the reason why (on certain days), I'd choose not to locate in this pub."
3,"It is in a random location, way off the strip. \n\n+1 delish garlic fries\n+1 really clean inside\n+1 great prices\n+1 Bacon cheeseburger is THE BEST\n\nI wouldn't make a special drive for these burgers, but it definitely a great place for a good burger."
3,I enjoyed my experience very much.  If I lived closer I would be there often.  Great happy hour.  Should consider opening a seperate location in Summerlin that does tapas.  I would be there.
4,"Every time I have used desert taxi, they have been so nice on the phone when I order a taxi, and the driver has always showed up early. In fact, If I wasn't ready, they always said, take your time."
1,"very small, and crowded, the most fun we had was taking a picture with a sexy zebra man."
2,"I hadn't had Papa John's for at least a year.  It's one of the better chain pizza places, and unlike the Domino's that moved, it's conveniently on my way home from work.  I got a $10 gift card for $5 from www.saveology.com and they had their large specialty pizzas for $11.  The large is only 14\"" which isn't really large, but the Spinach Alfredo pizza is pretty tasty.  I was disappointed they no longer put the butter sauce and pepporncini in the pizza box, but I understand it.  The service was a little slow as they have two registers but only one person working on one of them with a lot of people standing around.  I'd stop here for a pizza on my way home again if the price was right."
0,Complete rip off  of an appetizer $5. $5 for 2 dumplings about the size of my thumb. The regular menus price was $8 for 4 (which we were not made aware of before we ordered or we would have just gotten that). So we paid more per piece on their special happy hour menu. Happy hour wine was advertised as $4 glass was actually $5.  We won't be coming back. Feeling like you got taken is not a pleasant dining experience.
2,"Average burger , salad, beer/bar joint."
4,"We ONLY go to this theater to see movies. It's always clean. The staff is friendly. The concessions are good, soda mixed perfect every time. The theater seating is comfortable and spacious. \n\nIn five years, we have never had a bad experience at this theater."
0,"I've never once been able to get a pretzel dog at the McCarran Airport location, unless I wanted (was able) to wait for them to cook up a batch (we're usually in a bit of a hurry when at an airport, no?). \n\nNot once have they had pretzel dogs ready to buy when I've been there; hoping others have had better luck."
3,"So excited I made it back to an old staple. So, I was craving a fajita, but they don't offer the lunch size portion on Sundays so I chose a lunch combo, which didn't disappoint. I chose a beef taco & chicken burrito w/ rice and beans. The taco was great, meat seasoned perfectly, hot, yet the shell held up great. The burrito was filled with all white shredded chicken, topped w/ a red sauce & cheese...a lot of cheese, yum! The chips were great, but I have to say I miss the old salsa. The new one seems to be a little more roasted, hot than what I remember. I cannot wait to get back...definitely a fajita next time :-)."
1,"For the good: beer is cold, great TV's and the food is not bad BUT for the service OMG every single time it gets worse and worse. It is TERRIBLE and every time we go there are new servers. I have been told many times the turnover of employees is because the management is awful and they treat their employees BAD!!!!!  Time to STOP supporting This place especially because there are SO many great sports bars with great staff!!!!!"
0,"Proportions are appalling.  I ordered 1lbs. wings for $8, and got 6 medium sized wings.  I got an appetizer order of fries and got what I would say is a single order of fries... And that was $6... I ended up paying $14 for $7-$8 of food.  Extremely dissatisfied.  Save your money; don't order the wings or fries!"
2,"Hmmm I am American and I grew up in the NYC area, so I am fairly confident that I know good Italian food when I taste it.  I am not saying that the food isn't good, but it definitely did not blow me away.  We came here because it was listed as a Top 10 Best Restaurant in Edinburgh, according to The Guardian and I definitely would not rate this in my top 10.\n\nHowever, with that being said, the service was fantastic.  Our servers were all very friendly and attentive.  The portions here are enormous and we did feel that they mislead us into ordering more food than we needed because we did ask if the starters were big enough to shared and they recommended that we order two.  Both plates were huge and we certainly could have just shared one between the two of us.  Not to mention the entrees were enough for 2-3 people to share.  So come hungry!\n\nAmbiance has a little bit of a corny feel but also reminded me a lot of any Italian spot in suburban New York / New Jersey, in the sense that there was Frank Sinatra playing in the background the entire time and the servers were a little over the top trying to prove their Italian-ness (actual, and not the macho mobster Guido kind we see over here in the States)."
4,We came here since we were at the airport right by. This is a smaller Chipotle but it was sooooooo clean and the service was great!\nPlus I'm always a fan of chipotles and this one definitely represents the company in a great way!\n\nYum!
2,"I live in the area and love to support our local small businesses.  A few years ago we decided we would drop in and see what the Cajun Seafood Corner was all about.  The owner(s) was an Vietnamese couple and they were always so welcoming and friendly.  The food was good...I always get the Catfish Po' Boy with fries; has just enough spice and kick.  Within a year the couple who we cherished decided to sell the business.  Mind you this place had become our new spot, it was close, great happy hour,  good food, and wonderful service.  We would come in at least 4 to 5 times a month and usually with a new set of people-we loved it so much we wanted to tell everyone about this place.  After the new couple took over it went down hill....the service is quite mundane.  They're not rude but they're not nice.  We stopped going in because it really felt like our business was not appreciated.    There use to be many flat screens, so you could watch any game that may be playing...they've taken ALL T.V's down so now it's an awkward quietness with a faint sound of soft rock playing.  \n\nGive it a try...maybe I am just biased because I miss the old owners."
2,"We got to movie an hour early and had to sit in the front, although it was ok and the movie was good, the food lacked. I have the BBQ chicken pizza, which was more sauce than anything else. My friend ordered the BBQ cheddar burger, she couldn't eat it because it was super red in the center and my sister had the nachos which was more like a salad. Will try again..."
1,"Got in on GL, no cover, all good. Staff was kinda rude. Top floor and Hip Hop rooms were closed so only the main floor was open (Monday Night). Sat in the corner of the patio while we waited for the place to fill up and were told we couldn't sit. Lame...there was NO one in the outside tables. Bartender was a snot so I said F-this..XS is a 5 min cab...bye. I could see a possible good time here but I wouldn't pick it over Drais or XS or even Surrender. The staff should check out Drais and learn how it's done."
2,"Well, every six months I try this place in hopes that it will get better.  Third times the charm.  They seem to be getting a little better.  I had the meatballs and procutto pizza to go.  Both were very good!  Price was kinda steep for the portion size.  Staff was much friendlier and they had my order ready in under 15 minutes.  Will try again soon and keep my fingers crossed!"
4,"Awesome place, they have everything, i couldn't believe my eyes. The staff there is amazing!!!"
2,"So the big question since we moved down to Charlotte has been, Where the heck can we find a good bagel and slice of pizza? Someone told me that Einstein bagels has bagels that taste just like New York bagels, so I checked them out. Sadly, I was misled. Although, I must say, they were the closest I've found so far. I ordered a honey-wheat bagel and it tasted very fresh, it was still hot and soft. Put a little of their garden veggie cream cheese and I was good to go. Their cream cheese was VERY good, it wasn't as thick as most are and they didn't glop on enough for 4 bagels onto my one bagel. It was very light tasting, almost like hummus. YUM! If this is as close as it's going to get to a NY bagel, I'll take it."
2,"I don't know that Founder's Hall is really a building, as Lindsey R writes. It's more of an atrium behind/inside of a building. Having explained that, it's a nice place to head to get some food or some shopping done, presumably either during your lunch break or after work, since it's right in the middle of downtown (and most Charlotte peeps don't really spend too much time in the downtown area unless it's late at night on the weekend). \n\nFounder's Hall is a big, open area surrounded by fast-foody type places and shops like a little bookstore and a Bank of America store (weird). It's really bright and usually not that packed, though, so it's definitely a nice place to eat your lunch or grab a quick one if you're in a rush. Obviously, it's super accessible, so why not?\n\nThere's a little raised platform in there, too--try sneaking a meal in there. It's a great little area."
2,Ok more of a 3.5 star sushi joint. Nothing I had was mindblowing.
1,"Ummmm....not my favorite!! Have heard a lot of great things about Maizie's, but had a late lunch there over the weekend and was kind of underwhelmed.\n\nWe found the whole seating process very disorienting and confusing, but once we were settled, we found the menu to be too big and overwhelming! I am a girl who loves an option, but this is like a Cheesecake Factory effect where I begin to assume they serve everything, yet specialize in nothing. Plus, there are a million people running around the restaurant, but it didn't seem like anyone was really providing good service to their tables. Actually, that was because nearly every server was eating in plain sight of the diners, which just bugs, especially when my ice tea is empty. \n\nMy BF and I both ordered salads....both were okay although there were definitely some serious lettuce rejects in both. The chili was quite good though, which was a nice surprise!\n\nLooks like they have a good happy hour and a committed local Cen Pho crowd, which is always a pleasure to see, but I just didn't quite get it.  Sorry Maizie's, not thinking I'll be back anytime soon."
4,Al does some seriously good fish - get ya sum!!!
4,"Gluten free! I love this place. I can't eat everything her including the fries and the gluten free bun didn't fall apart! The staff was friendly and happy. The shakes were to die for. This is our new go to spot for sure! It has a drive through as well, which is pretty convenient. I'm telling everyone I know about this place. So good!!!"
4,This was by far the best find for a long time. We went today Sunday at about 10:30 had a 5 minute wait. Really good for a Sunday. We ordered and got our food in a good timely manner. The food was excellent and the portions sizes also very good sized. I would recommend this location to anyone. We each ordered something different and all was good. Drinks a little expensive but still for a first time going there I was really impressed.
3,"I don't crave Mexican food very often at all, but I think Chipotle is a great fast to-go place when you're just wanting a good taco, salad, or burrito.\n\nI was impressed that despite the growing lunch line forming, the employees at the counter assisted the customers very quickly! I was ordering and had my food in hand within minutes. \n\nWe had the steak salad and taco. Can't complain, it was tasty, custom-made with all your choice of fixings, and wrapped up ready to go. \n\nA good choice for lunch, I'd say..."
1,We were absolutely starving so we decided to check out this place...wish we hadn't. The food was lackluster - not all that cheap and NO RITAS! I suppose I needed to look for the apostrophe but I was kind of hoping they would have a variety of margaritas...but alas Rita is just the name.  With my hopes dashed I was left to the food which wasn't anything I'd give a second thought to. The day we went there was no live music and no real ambiance to speak of.
0,"We came over to check out the adventuredome... Lol big laughs... Well it's off the strip, so it isn't as classy as everything else, the adventuredome is not bad, but rides are limited and somewhat costly IMO. There are some carnival games/arcade which I love so we played some... Other than that, we were bored and left back to the strip!"
1,"Skip this place. Cheap sushi, sure. But not very good at all. Just go to TA on happy hour and you get so much better quality for only a little bit more and so much more variety"
1,"Not too bad, it's a cheap alternative to eating at the 24-7 or the other fancier restaurants in the Palms hotel.\n\nCheap, too. $7 for breakfast, $11 for lunch. Didn't do the dinner.\n\nBreakfast had an omelette station (they really overpack them), fruit, ham, bacon, and more.  Pastries, but no pies or ice cream, though. Ends at 10a for entry, I think.\n\nAfter that, the lunch buffet wasn't bad, pasta, pizza, corned beef, turkey, various American Chinese and other dishes that filled the plate and palate with all-you-can-eat goodness stuffed to the gills. Overall not a bad selection of different foods, including a Middle Eastern roast chicken dish. Different.\n\nIf you're a hotel guest or card holder, you get into the \""faster\"" line, and the regular drinks, I was impressed they had three types of sweetened ice tea (I had the green tea w/honey).\n\nService is a bit slow.  It is smaller than most casino buffets that I am familiar with, but not bad overall. Cheap. Order drinks separately at a different price."
1,"This is an odd and confounding review to write. This place has got solid five star reviews, so it looks like I'm going to be the odd man out here in the experience I had when I visited.\n\nMy girl and I are getting married soon, so the other day we decided to start yelping places to look for a suit. We found Men's Apparel Club shining like a beacon amongst the mostly scathing Men's Wearhouse reviews. It was a no brainer...an affordable and well reviewed local business...I had my mind made up and my credit card in the holster ready to buy if I found something decent.\n\nUpon walking in, we were promptly greeted by Barry and had a quick discussion regarding the style I was looking for. He quickly found a suit that was right down my alley and that I could easily see myself getting into. This is maybe where we got off on the wrong foot. As Barry was talking about the suit, my fiance got out her phone to show him a picture of her dress, just to get his opinion on if they would match or not. She was quickly given a 'sweetie...no pictures' warning, as Barry thought she was getting her phone out to take pictures. This is fine, I understand his reasoning behind this, but the experience went downhill at this point. \n\nWhat happened from here...I'm still confused about. I began to ask questions about the suit, as he allowed me to try the coat portion on and educated us on the ins and outs of buying a suit for a good ten minutes or so. I liked how the coat fit, and was definitely thinking I needed to try on the whole get up. That's when he hit us with this...I quote:\n\n\""I know I'm wasting my time with people like you. You're not gonna buy here, and I know that. You're gonna shop around and do what you do. That's okay. I don't mind helping you out. I really don't. You know why? You're young and you don't know any better. You gotta learn this stuff some way. I feel like it's my duty\"". \n\nThis statement didn't sit well with me right off the bat. There's nothing worse than being told what sort of person you are. Stereotyping/assuming to this level is something I've rarely experienced in a retail situation. I don't tolerate it in my personal life, and absolutely won't stand for it when I'm voluntarily looking to give someone my business. I let it slide and moved on.\n\nWe both at this point made a concerted effort to let him know that we were in fact very much considering buying a suit at his establishment. I even at one point said \""I haven't heard the best things about Men's Wearhouse and other similar places, so I'm absolutely interested in making the purchase here if we can find something\"". I tried to make several not so subtle hints, that I was in fact very much wanting and willing to make a purchase with him, but he wasn't hearing it for some reason or another. \n\nHe continued to almost 'anti-sell' us from this point out. It was extremely odd. It was like the opposite of being at a car dealership. We felt as if we couldn't try on suits or buy anything there even if we wanted to. He made multiple comments regarding shopping around at other places and continued to minimize our intention to buy. The odd thing was...he gave us all sorts of good advice regarding the ins and outs of buying a suit. However, at the same time he seemed unwilling and uninterested in selling us one personally! \n\nAfter about 25 minutes we finally decided it was time to go, as we really didn't feel very welcome. On the way out of the door I tried one more last ditch effort to let him know I was interested, it went like this:\n\n\""So, if I end up deciding on this suit would I be able to come back in early October to get everything going?\""\n\nBarry - \""October...I may not be around. You'll probably have to go elsewhere\"". \n\nThis was the story of our trip to Men's Apparel Club...the underlying feeling that our business wasn't wanted. I'm really not sure why or how this happened, some possibilities come to mind:\n\n-Communication style differences causing some sort of misunderstanding.\n-The phone issue getting the idea in his head that we had no intention of buying.\n-Us being young and Barry not taking us seriously.\n-Barry possibly having previous bad experiences with shoppers like us, leading to an unfair stereotype.\n-Some other issue I haven't thought of or didn't realize.\n\nIt's too bad we had this experience, because the truth is. This place has the best prices in town by far.\n\nMy suit at Men's Apparel Club - less than $250\nMy suit at Men's Wearhouse - $600\n\nSo in the end, I don't doubt that this is a great place to buy a suit for some people...it just wasn't for us based on our experience. Maybe I caught Barry on an off day, I'm not sure. Maybe Barry doesn't even realize the bad taste we left with. I'm now left in the odd position to thank Barry for all the great advice he gave me on buying a suit, then scratch my head and ask him why he didn't seem to want to sell me one."
0,"(This review is for Las Vegas ie: The Strip)\n\nWent to Las Vegas on the weekend for a friends 30th B'day celebration.\n\nIt quickly dawned on me that LV is everything I hate about the USA in one location. Mindless gambling drones, drunk red-neck frat boys at 2 in the afternoon, plastic barbies, the excess of it all.\n\nThe one star is for the flight home."

1,"Been going here for 4 years.... no more.  First reason is that they are all about $$$.  They have a video playing in the office that states you can't ask the doctor a medical question that isn't related to your current appointment.... really? They charge full \""doctor\"" appointment fees for something a PA can do.  Doctor showed up to check my lungs.... THAT\""S IT!!! There was absolutely no reason for the doctor to be there.  I just need an immunization!  Also,  they don't return calls.  No matter how many times I tell them the pharmacy I use, they send my scripts to another one.  Plus, they really don't go over the \""bad\"" aspects of certain procedures.  The PA suggested a procedure for me.  I went home, researched it, asked other doctors about it and decided against the procedure.  When I went back in the actual  Doctor asked me why I didn't follow through with it.  Once I told her my concerns she was like \""yea, I wouldn't recommend that procedure either\"".  Not to mention the wait times.  They may get you back fast, but you'll just sit and wait for the doctor.  Hopefully they'll turn this office back around.  Until then, I won't be going here any longer."
2,Ok but not fabulous-decor in room was bland.  Quiet with all the things a business traveler could want including business center where you can print out your boarding pass for free.  Great view of uptown and very comfortable beds.
3,"Although, still extremely delicious especially during lunch...I tried the dinner options and felt they were a tad bit overpriced for the portion size...best bet to come for their lunch combos...for dinner my go to is still Kyara"
0,"Overpriced & Horrible Housekeeping! \n\nI stayed in a suite for 5 nights, and continously had housekeeping issues that were reported and Not addressed. Housekeeping not coming until late in the afternoon, not vacuuming, leaving hair in the tub repeatedly, leaving standing water in the tub, hair in my sheets,  re - arranging my things, and USING MY TOLIET WITHOUT FLUSHING! \nStaff offered a complimentary breakfast which I was unable to use, offered me free snacks and soda. All I wanted was adequate housekeeping service. If I hadn't prepaid I would have left on the 2nd day. I WAS NOT COMPED. After showing the Asst. Mgr. pictures I was told I would get free nights stay certificates & bonus points. I had to call the Hilton customer service line TWICE and complete a survey before I heard back from the hotel, and after that I received 1 free regular room stay.\nMotel 6 service at a Hilton price. Just stay somewhere else & save yourself the frustration."
3,"Mrs. Ambiance and I went to Delux after the Chelsea Handler show this evening and their burgers were much more complex than the comedian.\n\nCool place, especially late night.  The long blue table in the center seems to be the place to be.\n\nThey tried to sit Mrs. Ambience and her sister (the really pickey one) out side, well, that did not work at all and we moved to the long blue table.\n\nThe food was just great, comfort food for late night.  Shopping basket for the fries is a great touch.\n\nEarly morning tomorrow, so could not fully ReTox."
2,"I have a friend who goes all the time to Benihana as it's her favorite place and I wanted to know what's so special. They do a $30 GC for your birthday if you sign up to their email so the BF and I decided to go. \n\nWhen you enter, there is this dark \""garden\"" they lead you through that is just beautiful. There is a lounge over looking it and there are seating areas and sushi bars around it but oddly none of it is being used..perhaps not on weekdays?. They lead us up an elevator to a teppan room that is pretty ordinary comparatively to the ambiance of downstairs so ambiance was a bit wasted. \n\nThey start you off with getting you out a soup, a salad with ginger miso dressing. They hand you 2 different sauces (hot sauce on request), cook zucchini and onions, shrimp appetizer and seafood items, then fried rice (extra. steam rice is what comes with your food), meat entrees and the guy did some mushrooms.I had the scallops, calamari, shrimps and BF got shrimp and chicken. Our food was cooked nicely, but it wasn't particularly special. The sauces were just okay, they needed more punch, it's just a bit bland and runny. \n\nThey have a efficient little planned out show and then the guy was gone. I was barely getting into our food and the guy just packed off and left. I was glancing at another table that just started their show and it was almost the same thing.  Service from the server helping the teppan guy was very personable and attentive though. Definitely top notch service and he even gave us some green tea ice cream and chatted with us a bit after dinner. I will give them that- excellent service. However, a bit sad that the server was more memorable than the teppan show! \n\nI can't help compare them to Musashi, a local teppan place I've had great experiences at over and over. There is so much more they offer there and that really overshadowed my experience at Benihana. The show is lengthier, a bit more complex tricks, the jokes and stories are fantastic and each teppan person has their own unique style, a bit cheaper in price with a really awesome fried rice included, soup, salad, veggies and plenty of different flavorful sauces freshly made in front of you. \n\nGlad I tried it, but will not be back. Even with the $30 birthday discount the bill was $70+ for two plus the tip. I went to Musashi a few months ago and spent $70 for two including a hefty tip! I had way more fun and better food.\n\n Um yeah. This feels like a no brainer to where I'll be going to the next time I want a teppan experience to bring visiting friends and family to."
2,"The custard is good.  We are always satisfied with the selection.  I enjoy the root beer floats, french fries and onion rings there."
3,"My husband and I have spent a few afternoons just chilling out at Brocach with friends. The atmosphere is just so cozy at both the bar and dining area. The servers and bartenders are very attentive and fun.\nThey have a great selection of beer and I absolutely LOVE the food!!!!\n\nThe duck fat fries are ridiculous... I don't know why that appetizer exists, but I am so glad it does. YUM!!!! Brocach also has delicious wings with very unique and tasty sauce options. The Guiness stout sauce is probably my favorite.\n\nI usually order the baked Mac and Cheese for dinner because it's incredible. I should probably venture out and get something else one of these days... But I just love that dish too much. My husband likes the burgers a lot and everyone I have ever dined with here enjoyed their meals immensely. Can't wait to go back!"
3,The breakfast menu is excellent.  Our group of nine was seated quickly and the service was great.  It's definitely a place I would return to for a brunch date or a special occasion.
3,"I like to think I'm a good local, but I never knew of this place until the Travelzoo offer came. A wonderful brunch spot right in downtown Phoenix (inside Westin Hotel). The decor is lovely and the service is on point, but the menu is also quite interesting. My favorite part is that they brew Intelligentsia Coffee (a Chicago favorite). One criticism: if the menu states 'roasted red peppers' I do not expect yellow, which are not as tasty. Overall, great experience I will repeat."
1,"Pizza was ok.. I ordered Vinnies, which is your choice of 5 toppings.  Italian sausage, black olives, onions, garlic and basil.  It wasn't bad - but it wasn't great either.  \n\nThe server was exceptionally friendly and helpful - but the service was the high point of the experience."
3,"Pretty much the only soul food in the stucco landscape of Scottsdale. The service and food is spot on for all things southern. Red velvet cake and grape koolaid are available here too. If you want some serious southern food, head to Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe (Lolo's grandma is Mrs. White). Love the pork chops and black eye peas! Both of these places are a local treasure!"
3,"I have to admit. I really enjoyed this place. Giant sports book with regular seating, or a giant stadium with couches and chairs to watch any sport until your heart is content?Yes please!\n\nI went with a huge group of friends, so we were in the restaurant area to start. Our waiter was great as he was able to keep up with about 10 of us which can be tricky at times. \n\nAfter checking out the menu, I settled on the Shrimp po'Boy ($16). The shrimp was fried on a griddle so it had a great crunch. Seasoning was Louisiana good. The french bread said it was New Orleans style and yes it was. Soft, tasty, wonderful French bread. Totally makes a po'Boy what it is. Also on the bread was lettuce, tomato and a slightly spicy Creole mayonnaise. I'm a po'Boy snob and this totally passed my test. \n\nThey also have a full bar, but wow I was in food love, so I didn't even pay attention to it. \n\nFor a nice place to hang with friends, watch sports and eat good food, this is the place."
1,"Been here several times before and it seems to get slower and slower every time I go.  Maybe it's the staff playing with water guns while at work.  I don't much care getting hit by water and neither did my friend.  You see, this hair of mine takes time to straighten, so I don't appreciate getting it wet.\nIt would also be nice if a server would come around and take an order.  Especially after I have already ordered before.    If my glass is empty, I might want another.\nI ordered a vodka with sprite and a beer and it came out to $10."
3,"While I definitely agree with the reviews that say the matzo ball sucks, I still enjoy the large portions and generally good sandwiches here.  I usually go here after work (11pm or so) when there's no line or anything so its fine."
3,Great layout.  It almost seemed like their bar had different venues.  Great food & selection of beers too.\n\nI was amazed how awesome the service was.  We went on a really busy night.
4,First time here and it was an amazing experience! Julia did exactly what I wanted to my hair and went above and beyond to teach me how to do it myself. Everyone is friendly and the environment is very inviting.
3,"Great Coney's.  Something about the hot dogs themselves they have a great \""snap\"" to them.  Had the cheese fries too, they did not dissapoint."
3,"Ambions-Nice for gora chamda's- brown chamdas look else where!\n I'm serious, you will not like eating at a neat & clean place like one of those stylish service and quantity of those of peasants\n\nFood-Nice level of spice and don't forget to mention that you want Indian spice.\n\nOverall- I might check in if I'm in that area"
0,"One of the worse Vegas buffets I've ever had.  Ended up being lazy and staying at Mandalay Bay the whole weekend so bought the \""All-Day Buffet pass\"" for $43.  Had the Sunday Brunch, nothing great.  Dry prime rib, minimal selections, dessert selections limited to muffins, cakes and cookies.\n\nHope they would redeem themselves for Sunday dinner...I was wrong.  Same dessert selections.  Saw same ingredients from the brunch buffet used for dinner items.  I can't say weather if it's true...but...I saw sausage from brunch was seen in dinner's paella.  Not a lot of changes from the brunch menu to dinner menu.  Definitely not worth the ~$28 price."
4,This place is an Arizona treasure.  I have been going there for 15 years now and it's always consistently good.  I recommend the 7Q & 9Q with black beans and jerk fried rice.  The included Snicker Doodle cookie makes it a complete meal.
4,Love the place! The newest songs! Best gathering place in town!
4,"The food at Little Shanghai is plentiful and reasonably priced.  The architecture and ambiance is a little dated but still has a high level of authenticity that is fitting and functional.  I haven't been to a better chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  The house chicken is to crave for late at night in your  refrigerator.  The sizzling beef should be a little more dangerous, kind of didn't sizzle the way my imagination played out.  The bar even works functionally and has some character.  Highly recommend if your are in the Arcadia area."
4,Just used a groupon for date night and man are we going back! Service was outstanding. Food was amazing and drinks were sooooooo good! Highly recommend the brauts and the beer flight!
4,"Came here today on a whim that I needed to pamper myself. After reading the good reviews on the waxing, I decided to make an appointment.  It was about 11 am when I called, and the lady on the phone told me to come on in. When I walked in, I was greeted right away with a friendly staff.  Jenny helped me with my eyebrows, highlights, and haircut. I felt like I was #winning today. My eyebrows were unshaped, and I never had it waxed before. Needless to say I am hooked on waxing, and I can't wait to get pampered again. I would also love to comment that Jenny did an excellent job on my hair, layers, color. I just love it. I am a happy customer, and felt pretty walking out."
4,I just have to update this to say that they no longer have a minimum for credit card purchases.  Love their spinach and feta croissants!
0,"Rude, racist, dark. Unconscious drunk people at the bar or at the entrance smelling like urine. Homeless old men grabbing at my date. Pretty much an assault. Place attracts the detritus."
2,Friendly hostess who also brought our food. I think the food was okay for the price we paid but the coffee was excellent nice and strong unlike American coffee! Probably will give it another try soon.
0,"I have to say that I think I am over it.  I am from LA originally, and maybe I have just been spoiled by really good and cheap Thai food. When I moved to Vegas, this was my go to Thai spot, partly because someone recommended it and partly because there was not much else to choose from in our area.  Pin Kaow has some decent tasting food, but my biggest problem is that I feel like the portion sizes are getting smaller, and it is just not worth the price."
2,"This place is \""okay\"" for vegas (DOESN'T compare to Thai food in LA).  This so-called Thai restaurant seats about 20 people.  Their menu is actually a mix between Chinese and Thai food.  \n\nIt was really disappointing to open the menu and see things like Orange Chicken on the menu.  Really?  Really?!  They don't even have basic Thai appetizers such as angel wings or fish patties.  We were actually debating to leave the place without ordering because it did not have a lot of Thai dishes, but the employees were too nice so I decided to stay.\n\nWe ordered two dishes (because there really wasn't anything else on the menu that sounded Thai, nor appetizing) -- Boat Noodle Soup and Chicken Basil.  The noodle soup had a good flavor, but they did DUMB IT DOWN BIG TIME for vegas locals.  They did NOT have the pork rinds, blood, lliver, and tripe that a boat noodle soup usually has.  The broth was really sweet too, which was overpowering until I added my own chili flakes to balance the flavors.  \n\nThe chicken basil was ok tasting, but wasn't great.  The place definitely dumbed down the spice factor too -- considering we requested \""medium\"" for both dishes, the dishes were NOT spicy at all.  Again, I think this place is catering towards a clientele that can't handle much spicy food nor distinguish between Chinese and Thai food. \n\nMy bf pointed out their water is filtered, which is a good thing, and that they \""flavor\"" their water with slices of lemons and oranges in the water pitcher.  Just fyi for those picky water drinkers out there.  This also tells me that their soups, most likely, have a better taste because the water is filtered.\n\nI would only come here again when I'm craving (semi) Asian food in Vegas and  cause it's cheap -- for two dishes it was only $14."
2,"From all the other reviews I read it appears my experience was the same as many others: great atmosphere, good good, terrible service. \n\nI go up for a refill of my coffee and a worker is standing in front of the espresso machine pouring herself and drinking espresso shots. After standing there for about a minute I finally say something to her, \""Could I please have a refill?\"" She then decides to acknowledge my existence and hastily pours me a refill. \n\nThe coffee tasted great and so did my sandwich, but I don't think I should have to wait for the barista to finish her self-poured shots of espresso before I'm allowed to get my refill."
3,"Overall, a great spot. Mostly AYCE but you have the option to order ala carte & can even order 1/2 rolls, which is great for trying new things on a budget. The fish is always eceptionally fresh, & Ive never been disappointed after a visit there, though they are a bit creeative with some of the special rolls....(The Tornado Roll, raw fish & cheddar cheeses? I tried but, IMO, not a great idea.)"
2,"This buffet used to be way better. It had its own identity, with good food. \n\nNow it is a sad imitation of the Bachcanal buffet at Ceasars. They have a few different meats at the carving station. They are serving things in their own little cooking containers. Just like the Bacchanal. They even use the same tyoe of music. Yet the food quality and service isn't as good as the Bacchanal.\n\nMy wife had a bagel that was hard. Our waitress went on break so our table stopped being served. When I went to get ice cream the server gave it to me. Then remembered he was supposed to be wearing rubber gloves. It didn't replace my ice cream that he used his fingers to help serve, he just went on to the next person. \n\nThe price is not impressive either. We paid $32 each today for brunch. Yesterday we paid the same at the Bacchanal for lunch. \n\nMy recommendation,  if you don't feel like walking or waiting this buffet is fine. If you don't mind waiting or walking then go to Ceasars."
0,"This place is a total fad. Food sucks, its run by WHITE HIPPIES. People who eat here dont know anything about good food. The guy working there isnt friendly and the whole place is full of hippies. It also stinks like weed and there is a ton of underage drinking. Its really lame. So many more good taco shops besides this one. The Chicken tacos are garbage too. They taste like some middle eastern dish dumped in tiny corn tortillas. Really bad. \n\nIt reminds me of being in San Francisco in one of the old hippie areas. Its really bad. Also... TOFU TACOS?? Fail... Thats not mexican, its a bastardization of what mexican food is. This isnt fusion, its a joke."
1,"We came here after hitting the Monarch Theater right next door. It was 10 bucks per person to get in. For a bar that has a club type of vibe, they actually had a good beer to drink. Odell IPA. I mean, every other dance club type of establishment the have only the normal Bud/Miller/Coors. \n\nI give this place 3 stars because downstairs sucks. The DJ down there sucked really bad, and the smoke machine smelled like crap. Downstairs is a hip hop type of vibe, and upstairs had EDM house music being mixed. As a big time EDM fan, I heard some Wolfgang Gartner, Feed Me, and Porter Robinson. Good stuff. Great music going on upstairs. \n\nUpstairs was awesome, but just way too cramped. Another thing that sucked was that there was a crap ton of dudes dancing up there. They should have taken a queue from the Monarch next door and let ladies in for free.  They ought to have the EDM DJ downstairs, and put the hip hop DJ out of a job, because no one was dancing to his mix. I mean, I tried to give him a chance, but he was playing THE WORST hip hop.Stuff you have never heard that is not dance worthy. I am not expecting the Scottsdale hip hop mash up, but it would hurt to play something someone has actually heard. \n\nPrices were average. 5 bucks for an Odells and 7 bucks for a liquor mixer. I would come back here if they did something better with the downstairs. The bar counters downstairs were really sticky, and there was barely anyone down there. Would it hurt to wipe down your counters more frequently? \n\nI down rated it to 2 stars because of the split atmosphere, and the overwhelming amount of dudes. Otherwise, if it wasn't a sausage fest, I would have given it 3, and if the downstairs wasn't lame, it would get a 4."
1,"I ordered my food an hour and 17 minutes ago.  I'm so hungry, why won't you bring me my food?\n\nI get it, you're probably busy, then don't take my order.  I'll come pick it up, I promise.\n\nedit: Called them once at an hour and once at an hour 20, each time they said he just left 5 minutes ago. Totally ridiculous, I will never order from them again. The teriyaki chicken skewers were really good though, so I'll give them 2 stars, but barely."
0,"I couldn't agree more with Sabrina L. \nThe food is under average, especially for the prices they ask. \nService? What service? My wife wasn't hungry so she went for the \""a la carte menu\"" instead of the buffet. When the waiter brought my food, he insisted on me eating it alone not sharing it with her. That was pretty embarrassing considering he said it out loud and all the tables around us heard it. \nThe only positive thing: decor is nice\nWill not return."
1,"I keep going back to Tammie Coe because I love their food!  From the quick grab and go small sandwiches and sides (that are really inexpensive actually) to a delicious prosciutto and Parmesan baguette - it has ALL been good.  The cupcakes, the muffins, the coffee.  \n\nThe reason I seriously think today was my last time there is because of the staff. I go there on average once a week, but each time the staff has been rude and each time I think 'well, maybe they were having a bad day'. But since it has happened consistently for nearly a year, and numerous other posts mention the same thing, I'm certain its not me or their bad day. It's their very unprofessional attitude.  \n\n8 out of 10 times the male cashier has had a dirty shirt on (that was way too tight and downright gross) and a two times I was there, the staff in the back were cooking without shoes on.  \n\nAs I write this it appears to me how ridiculous it is that I keep going back, but the convenience and the quality of the food is really hard to find so close to my office.  \n\nI hope you all have a better experience. But Tammie Coe - if you are reading this... Fire the dark haired extra moody barista and the incompetent, dirty-shirted young man.  The manager (I'm assuming) is a really nice guy, but I can't understand why he is allowing such a potentially amazing store be handled so poorly.\n\nMy hope is that those people are gone the next time we're there, replaced with helpful, competent people that are welcoming and fun...otherwise I fear Tammie Coe might be another empty downtown storefront."
2,Very dark on the inside spinach dip was to damn parmesan...my sandwich u did had to much cheese it was nasty .. Curly fries were good
0,"I was excited when I bought my project car. Hey, it was in pretty good shape for its vintage and it's very rare. I did need to have the bumper chromed as they were off a late mid century Japanese car. These cars where not known for their sturdy materials, every knows that. \n\nWell, I decided to put all my faith in the folks over at Papago and it turned out to be a massive blunder. Well, they probably did their best. But, their best isn't good enough to restore your dream. Hey, if you need a tub faucet done, go to them. In addition to a filthy location, you'll get some rudeness, a lot of lateness (and a few \""We'll have it tomorrow afternoons\"") and then, when they botch the job, they'll tell you it was the material they had to work with? Really, the same material that I brought to you weeks before and asked you to make perfect? The material?\n\nSo, now I have to live with this substandard job and take it to a real restoration place, one that knows what they're working with and won't blame the material for their botched work. I gave them a 1 ranking, after all, they get me SOMETHING back. Nothing I want, but it is something. \n\nEmail me, I'll show you the kind of work they did for me."
1,This Sonic had good food (for a Sonic) but service was very slow.\n\nBe advised that they use fake whipped cream as a topping on their shakes and (presumably) ice cream.
2,"Oh my, dare I...yes, I'm going to have to go with 3 stars.  Normally I would shun, poo-poo, and dismiss a gringo-Mex place like Carlos O'Brien's, but I got thinking that for what it is (gringo-Mex)... it's pretty darn OK!  Last night's meal of grilled shrimp and vegetables clinched it. The tacos are pretty good, the chimis, the burritos...and to find a decent, light ,healthy option too (I gotta go healthy once and a while, just not too often), well that's special."
0,"I don't know where to start, but overall, it was a lousy experience.\n\nI don't frequent any DD very often, but stopped at this one on the way to work for breakfast today.\n\nI got a flatbread breakfast sandwich, hash browns, and a pumpkin latte. The latte tasted like sewer water and I gave up trying to drink it after half the cup. The hash browns were actually pretty good, but the guy who handed me the food (who was the manager) didn't give/ask about ketchup. The sandwich was incredibly dry and the bread was hard/stale.\n\nThe staff were friendly and the entire thing only cost $6, but I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nAs far as food, you're 0 for 3, Dunkin."
1,"I spent some time at Encore on opening night. \n\nCASINO: It's just like the Wynn, but with a slightly altered color scheme. \nToo much red; I felt like I was walking around in a maraschino cherry.\nThe ceilings are too low making it seem claustrophobic.\n\nRESTAURANTS: The Cirque-y moving-walls at Switch will underwhelm you every 25 minutes.\nDidn't get in to Sinatra's cuz there was a private party. \nDidn't get to Botero Steakhouse but it looks very appealing. Art helps with protein-digestion as far as I'm concerned. \nThere is no buffet: halleleujah!\n\nXS was the one bright spot...a gorgeous venue! I predict this club will become the hottest destination in the club universe. \nUntil,of course, the next over-the-top, Rome-is-burning club opens.\n\nDidn't see the rooms yet. \nI heard the Spa is extraordinary.\n\nThe best thing about Encore is the same as the best thing about Wynn: the employees. They are the best-trained casino-workers anywhere. Frankly, it's worth going there just for them."
3,"Ive been hear twice now. Once on 4/20 2013 and 1/10/14 both good times. Its Downtown so what do you expect, its not the strip so nice jeans and shirt works. Now on 4/20 day this place was so packed, there was a line to get to the roof top and the place was just to packed. All of Vegas was packed so we got used to it. Dancing was a minimum just to packed. Now on 1/10/14 the place was busy but at least we were able to dance and enjoy the night on top of the roof with a beer in my hand. Drinks a little pricey with a beer and cosmo for 17 bucks. Bartenders drinks, my GF liked, so they knew how to make drinks. Both times we were there we had no issues, good atmosphere so we will be back."
2,"I really wanted to love this show, but I guess my expectations were too high. This was the first Cirque du Soleil show I watched, and it was pretty entertaining, though I wasn't \""wowed\"" or anything.The girls were hot. The guys were hot. There were jokes (some funny, some not so much). Acrobats. Dancing. They even grabbed some audience members to join in on their sexy fun.\n\nThe show wasn't very cohesive, but nonetheless, it was a good show, though I wouldn't watch it again. I definitely want to see \""Love\"" and \""O\"" next time.\n\nWould I recommend this show? Yes, if what you're looking for is something a little more \""adult\"" and sensual. Personally, it just wasn't my thing, but this is definitely a good production."
1,"I hope this place gets better with age.  It serves food 24 hours, which I need after late nights at work.  However, the service is AWFUL.  The hostesses are cranky.  The wait staff seems like this is their first time (and, yes, I've been more than a few times).  The food comes out in weird orders - like my co-workers ice cream sundae coming out before the appetizers.  We waited a good 10 minutes for water and when she finally brought water, she brought a try of full glasses, slowly placing a full glass down and then picking up the empty, never been filled glass off the table.  This took entirely too long.  Where was the water pitcher?  \nI had a cheese pizza.  Hard to go wrong there.  It wasn't great but it was late night food and it did it's job.  We also ordered a caesar salad which was so over dressed I couldn't eat it.  My husband liked his jolly rancher cocktail.  I hear all the candy type cocktails are great but I wasn't in the mood.  \n\nOh, Kim Kardashian was seated just as we were leaving if you care about that sort of thing."
2,"Just opened following winter over seeding. Course played surprisingly well. Tees and fairways were in good shape. The greens were really slow from the overseeing but held and putted very well considering. Expected to play \""automatic 2-putt\"" but all the greens were good. The rough was a golf ball eating monster. Deep heavy bermuda swallowed up shots and hid the balls. Would certainly play again."
1,"For $4.99 you can get a large bowl of Pho Tai but the bowl of soup noodles are nothing special. There was a sparse amount of meat and it was not particularly tender nor the broth flavorful.\n\nThe service was typically aloof for an Asian restaurant. The funniest part is that on each table, there is a plastic placard with 4 or 5 small buttons at the base. Reading the card, it says that Pho Huong Saigon takes pride in its service and has installed this system to maintain their high level of service.\n\nIdeally, with the press of a button, you can get attention from your waiter for a refill or the check. \""No more snapping your fingers to get the waiter's attention...\""\n\nWTF? This thing acknowledges people who snap their fingers at waiters!\n\nAnd if your dining establishment were so service-oriented, no one should even have to *think* about asking for a refill or the bill. The waiter would bring it or check in with you periodically to see if you needed anything.\n\nBut... what the hell. I figured I'm here so I'll play.\nI pushed the button for a refill.\n\nI pushed it again.\n\nDamn.... I think my plasic thingie is broken because I can see my waiter at the other side of the restaurant slurping up his own bowl of noodles.\n\nI wave my hand in his general direction. I even consider snapping ;)\n\nBut, instead I went up to the cash register, asked for refill, and asked for my bill. The waiter overheard and got up immediately and said he'd bring it to us.\n\nSigh.\n\nThe hostess was the one shining star.\nShe was a petite Asian woman with a TON of makeup, gold lame leggings and a glitzy shirt. I was waiting for her to say, \""Me love you long time.\"" Frankly, I think she might be management or the owner. Too bad her employees aren't as snazzy or interesting.\nToo bad the food wasn't very good.\n\nThe other positive is that the experience was super cheap... and the restaurant seemed relatively clean. I'd only come here again to see the hostess because she was such a character."
1,"Recently ate breakfast here on a Saturday morning in mid Oct '13.\n\nWait : 5 mins for 2 patrons at 11:00am. : 4 stars\nDining room : 50's era diner decor. clean and in good repair : 4 stars\nMenu choices:  plenty of options, and menu was easy to read : 4 stars\n\nFood : my party ordered :\nveggie omelet - 3 stars, \npancakes - 1 star, (undercooked, raw on the inside)\nscrambled eggs - 3 stars, \nbacon - 3 stars, \nhash brown potatoes - 2 stars (undercooked)\n\nValue : above average prices for quality of food, average prices for quantity of food\n\nSummary :\nMeal was forgetable. Nothing extra ordinary. Sub-par for a main-line casino on the Vegas strip. I would likely not dine here again as there are many, many other choices for breakfast in Vegas, both as part of casinos as well as private establishments."
1,"This place stays alive becase there are hungry jurors trapped in the basement of the grand jury room who need food.  The carpet hasn't been cleaned since probably the Nixon era.  And the food is pretty standard.  That said, everyone has to go there at least once so that they say they have a) survived it b) been there c) surprisingly crave it.  Most people pick a, but some surprisingly pick c.  It's an old-school Phoenix thing and you have to support that!"
3,"I like this little store. It's nothing compared to the giant store in north Scottsdale. However, I like shopping here because it's a little bit less crazy most of the time. They don't carry all the stuff (and no food court or bar-haha) that the other store has, but they still have most of the good stuff. I usually go there after shopping at Trader Joe's!"
0,"If you're going here for some fun, then by all means have at it!  If you're considering this place for a league night, run the other way as fast as you can and NEVER look back. \n\nI have been on a league at this center now twice, first time was just a fun BS league and this time is a more serious, prize league.  The people that I have bowled with on both leagues have been lots of fun and very down to earth friendly, and the staff, well for the most part are wonderful.  However, there is this bartender that works who is a complete you know what and I'd rather literally walk out of the bowling center and go get another drink before having to deal with this guy; he is not friendly at all, I wish I knew his name, all I know is he works Thursdays.  \n\nAnyhow, the lanes themselves- let's talk about this tragedy that is Santa Fe bowling.  On my first league  I had to switch lanes I believe a total of 9 times in a 10 week league, and three times were in one day!  It was absolutely horrible, pins kept getting knocked down by the machine, the machine broke, the ball return didn't work, the computer system froze up- anything you can possibly think of went wrong.  One time myself and three other bowlers literally almost wiped out on the lane because of grease on the lane (one they moved us to after the other two didn't work) and I suppose they forgot to check it to make sure everything was fine.  This was on the fun league, but had it been on the prize league and I threw my ball in the gutter because of that, I would have been furious.  I'm not some psycho angry going to get you if you mess my game boup bowler either (I shudder to think how they'd react) I'm just a normal guy trying to do my best and win that prize fund!  \n\nAnyhow, lets flash forward to the new prize league I'm on.  The very first week, on the very first persons turn a pin knocks down.  We reset, it knocks down again, and again, and again, and again. Literally almost 6 or 7 times, finally we call them, they take almost 10 minutes to fix it.  She bowls, then my turn and guess what, it falls again, and again, and again! The people next to us were having the same problem, it repeated for them almost 25 minutes.  Finally the nightmare of an evening had ended.  Now I'm looking at going for my second week of bowling when I get a call from a teammate, \""Oh hey the lanes are broken, they said that we would need to reschedule for another night to bowl\""  So now, they have screwed up my whole schedule because I have fit things around Thursday night bowling;  I was livid and so were my teammates.  We start playing and guess what happens! You got it, pins are falling over, again and again and again; another twenty minutes there.  Just yesterday we had to make up a day for this Thursday because a couple of us will be out of town, so we start and about 15 minutes in right around the 5th frame first game, guess whaaaaaaaat! Oh yes, again!  I have another 29 weeks of this crap and its REALLY getting old.  After this league is over I will never come back to this place to bowl again until they fix their lanes.  I don't pay 15 bucks a week plus outrageous alcohol prices to deal with this, people have lives and work and we don't have 4+hours for what shouldn't be longer than a 3 hour set.  \n\nSanta Fe check yo stuff!"
0,I came to have a skin rash checked and saw a PA since I had to wait a month to see the Doctor. I had multiple subtle rashes on my skin and was told that it wasn't anything serious. My rash grew and turned out to be a fungal infection that has now discolored my skin. I saw a PCP who prescribed the proper medication but it still has not retuned my skin to its original color. Never going back there.
3,Great place to grab a few beers with the friends. Awesome energy. Love going there!
1,By first look this place is amazing. But when you really start checking things out you see how expensive it is. They do have some cool things but the place is so jam packed it's impossible to see everything. I went in looking for a TV table & never was asked if I needed help or anything.
3,"Food was good (same as last time - and as always when I go) but they lose a star for service.  Look, you may hate your job, and hate the singing in front of everybody part of it, but YOU signed up for it.  If you don't like it - go get a new job!\n\nGood thing I like their burgers so much or this might have annoyed me enough to not go back!"
1,"I've been here three times over two summers (2013 and 2014), and only had received good food once. \n\nThe first time around (July 2013) I had the Grilled Chicken Panini, which was incredibly soggy from the pesto and cheese. \n\nOne week ago I had a Reuben, and while it was pretty solid, it also wasn't anything particularly special.\n\nYesterday I ordered the \""Famous\"" Salmon Burger, and it came in around 3-5 minutes. Huge red flag; it was very obviously frozen. Extremely bland, not fresh (smelled far too fishy for fresh salmon), just meh. The roasted red pepper mayo wasn't that great, either.\n\nThe fries are alright, though they're extremely greasy.\n\nI could see this place succeeding if the food was cheaper, but the prices here are absolutely outrageous for the quality of food."
0,"Worst Storage Unit ever! Don't store here, and if already, VACATE IMMEDIATELY!!! Managers are rude, Owner  has the worst business skills. Customers word means nothing. Extremely Selfish, and unwilling to compromise! Apparently have never heard about \""customer always being right\"" instead they argue with the customer and simply don't care!! I will post this everyday till the word gets out!!! VACATE, & DO NOT CONSIDER, OR THINK TWICE!!!!"
0,Dishonest thieves!!! Stay away
2,"My wife and i went for lunch last week.  The food was so so and the service was a bit slow.  We both got lunch specials that came with soup, spring roll and fried wontons.  The soup was not what I would call a traditional Thai soup, the spring roll was too greasy, and the wontons were bland.  My wife got the yellow curry and I got Panang.  I ordered mine \""Thai spicy\"" but it was more like medium.  Next time we go for Thai we'll try the Thai Cafe which is just a mile or so away."
1,Good docs - young but nice and responsive to questions.  The office staff isn't the most pleasant.  \nThe prices are reasonable and the facility is new - very nice.
2,Happy Hour is fun!  Great food and drink specials!
4,"Such amazing home services! I have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees, residents and the owner Lida. Beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family! I wish there was 10 stars to rate them! :)"
3,3.5 stars just for this visit.\n\nI got their avocado and proscuitto pizza with egg whites. I was disappointed by their proscuitto; it was thick and tough. I also wasn't happy with the way they cooked their egg whites. They usually crack and separate the egg white onto the middle of the pizza. Then they stick it back in the oven and let it cook for a few minutes. This time they cooked it in a skillet and put it on top of the pizza. It wasn't the same as baking it right onto the pizza. \n\nI was disappointed by this visit. I bought a LGO mug anyways. I wanted to be reminded of my favorite lunch spot back home. I love them that much.
1,"We were there this weekend for breakfast, and ended up having brunch due to the long line.  It was $24.99 for brunch.  The wait was long but the food was ok.  I like from a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6, compared to the Wynn which I give a 9.  A lot of their food lacked flavor.  The line was long and the dessert bar SUCKED!  I love dessert, and it is a 3 compared to the Wynn which i give a 10.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Taste wise, I did not care for it.  Our waitress was great, she was very busy, but she tried to keep up with our needs especially the mimosa refills, which I guess was the only good thing about the buffet because it was included and non stop refills.  I would have given this place a 3 star except for the situation that happened while we were waiting for a table.  Originally we had 4 people for the buffet, and a few of our friends joined us and it turned into 9.  Which after waiting for an hour and a half in line, we didn't want to wait for a larger table.  There was a large group in front of us maybe about 20 before we got there and they waited for a while for a table.  So we decided that we were going to split into 2 groups since we weren't going to leave the restaurant at the same time anyways.  So we told our waitress that we wanted to go from 9 people into 2 groups of 4 and 5.  Well, when we told her that she got mad, but we weren't even next in line for a table.  We were maybe about 10 people behind being next.  So we did ask if we can get seated near each other if possible but when we told her, Marta the hostess got all mad at us and started giving us dirty looks.  We were then seated and a few minutes later my friends that met us up there were seated as well, they were seated on the opposite side of the restaurant where there was another table that was vacant the whole entire time they were there even before they were seated.  So Marta could have seated us together but she didn't and while we were eating the whole time she kept giving us dirty looks.  We later realized that if it was a party of 8 people or more the gratuity charge is 18%.  So we were given bad service with dirty looks because our hostess wasn't going to get the 18% gratuity charge.  I have been to Rio and the Wynn's buffet, and never at any of the other two buffets had we had bad service due to a gratuity charge.  Like I said you get what you pay for.  And another thing that I almost forgot to mention if you are looking for the omelet station, look at the dessert bar, because it's not near where the savory food is, but if you are looking for the crepe bar, it is next to where the savory food are and oh don't get banana's for your crepe, because they are brown and mushy."
4,"The show makes me cry and haunts my dreams, in the best way ever. The remixed Beatles songs were masterfully done with the highest respect. The interpretations of each song were wonderfully done, and the characters, oh, the characters. We have gold circle tickets right where everything (like the giant screens) was dead center, and I cannot tell you, it blew my mind, you could interact with the performers almost. It make me fall in love with The Beatles all over again. \n\nNot gonna lie - I recommend smoking mary jane beforehand (if you do that sort of thing). The psychedelic bits really pop when under the influence. Any way - straight, drunk, high, whatever - its completely magnificent."
1,"2 star go to this Starbucks for service alone, seeing as the majority of Starbucks are consistent in their quality of coffee.\n\nI nicked in here for a quick caramel latte to kill some time before an event I was attending and didn't receive the best of service from a gent who didn't seem to care whether I was a customer or not.\n\nBy no means am I saying I should be treated like royalty but being asked \""What do you want?\"" instead of \""What can I get for you?\"" make huge differences to an experience in a branch, especially in a city that seems to survive on coffee and tea lovers.\n\nLovely in its layout and relaxed in its vibe, this would have been a nice place to sit and relax for 10 but I decided it best to take my latte for a walk instead."
2,"Decided to try this place on a whim. It has a nice atmosphere and service was great. I ordered salmon sashimi and it was very fresh. They also had fresh wasabi - a must with good sushi. The rest of my order was blah. Spicy lobster roll was bland and I couldn't even tell there was lobster in it. The spicy salmon tacos tasted fishy and had very little sushi and too much guacamole. The ra chips and salsa was way too sweet and just not good. I ate at the sushi bar which has crumbs and drips from prior customers. It wasn't all bad, but I won't come back."
4,"I came here as part of a Girls' Night Out package, so I understand this won't be available to everyone... BUT... for a 55-per-person prix fixe, we got: shrimp cocktail with the biggest freaking shrimp I have EVER seen, a wedge salad for each girl, a 10 oz. filet mignon for each girl, two sides of green beans and two sides of asparagus to share, an individual serving of french fries for each girl, and a mini creme brulee and caramel donut for each girl.\n\nFirst of all, that's a lot of damn food for 55 dollars in Las Vegas! The 10 oz. filet could have easily been that much on its own, and it was phenomenal. The meat was flavorful and tender, and we hardly even used the sauces they gave us. We couldn't finish everything they gave us; if I wasn't signed up for a prix fixe menu, I would definitely go for the filet and maybe a side of green beans. It'd be enough food, and it's incredibly tasty!"
4,"Went here with some friends before heading out to old town to club and it was incredible. Everyone ordered something different and we shared - and ALL of it was amazing. From the enchiladas to the fish tacos to even the rice and beans. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so this is saying a lot. \n\nThe place itself was absolutely gorgeous, from the exterior to the interior. The seating both outside and inside is comfortable (we had moved from inside to outside seating just out of curiosity). Outside was nice because they had heaters since it was Winter, so we thought we might freeze but it was actually very comfortable. The chairs and couches were really nice as well and they had fire pits which you could dine next to (I loved that part). \n\nThe bathrooms were beautiful and clean and the service was also great. \n\nIt is a bit pricey but everything is delicious, so it's a give and take for sure. \n\nThe good thing about this place is that it's great for dates as well as friends and family."
2,"It was a great burger, but the price tag doesn't support what you get (2 burgers, 1 order of onion rings and a drink = 75 bucks)... not this guy!"
2,"I had the fish and tofu tacos for lunch. They use corn tortillas, which I respect. The fish was good and the tofu mixture was interesting, but the tacos were not particularly great.  The location seems good though. The bar has a lot of space around it, and I assume the patio is quite nice."
2,Service is excellent. Food was so-so. Music is also good. Drinks were tasty. Sit upstairs where the band is.
0,"The long haired guy tried to tell me my bike didn't work (it does work) and that I needed an $80 tune-up for it to work again, I've been riding my bike all day with no problems!"
2,"Need a 1/2 star button. 3-1/2 stars here. Tried tamale chx salad and raspberry tea. The chx salad was good (grapes, celery, green onion, almonds) sliced so thin makes not one thing overpowering..tamale was not bad not dry somewhat flavorful...they were out of strawberry honey tea, settled for raspberry-typical... Meal was only $8, not bad..probably won't be back except to try this strawberry-honey tea ppl are yelling about..very friendly and fast"
4,"WOW this is by far the best selection of flavors and best tasting ice cream ever. I highly recommend this ice cream parlor, they have boba and are open til 2AM!"
4,I am from Dallas and in Champaign for business.  I looked at Yelp for suggestions on good places to eat and Bacaro seemed to be the place to go.  I thought it was great.  Unique tasty dishes!
0,Called today to order a pizza was told they won't deliver to me. No reason why. Nothing. I wont order from them again. Their loss. Funny they used to deliver here. Scoffs .. Guess my money isn't green enough for them.
3,OMG!!! i loved it. I had the Las Vegas Dog my GF had the Mob Boss Dogg and we SMASHED!!! its a nice cozy spot perfect for watching a game eating great food and grabbing a beer. 3 thumbs up if i had another. lol
4,"The crew is amazing, some of the nicest people I've ever met."
4,"So, funny I just read the previous review.  I am in the same boat, i.e. I have been known to drive from Chicago to Madison to see Nicole.  I have been unable to replace her... ;-(  Her cuts and colors are consistently good.  \n\nShe is great and was recently promoted to manager... kudos, she deserves it!"
1,"Don't let the shape of my eyes deceive you, this was the first time I have really tried Korean food. When my husband and I walked in we were greeted by happy faces. Two women were making what looked like pot stickers and one was eating off of a cob of corn. I'm not sure that would pass a health inspection, but we continued on anyway.\n\nWe were directed to the back and there was no one else there except a karaoke machine. We ordered the Bi Bim Bop, which is a rice bowl. After picking at the items in the bowl, the server came around and taught us to mix the ingredients together. It tasted better that way. \n\nThe food was good with a strong sesame flavor; however it did not win me over. I was more disappointed in the hidden fees. Because my husband and I were trying this for the first time, we wanted to share. Once we told the server, she gave a funny look. She brought us out two cups of soup. At the end, when we received the bill, she charged us $5 for one cup of miso soup, that we didn't ask for. Not a fan of that. \n\nI'm not sure we will be back for the food or for the hidden fees. In any case it was an interesting experience."
0,"greeter which is basically security was the coolest dude there, they have hardly any wireless routers and when you ask somebody a question they are always in a hurry to get away from you to go on break i would not return to this location at all"
0,This review is for tires/automotive - I made an appointment (the only time they take appointments) to get my '06 VW Jetta an alignment.  I got there at the appointment time.  45 minutes later I saw my car still sitting in the lot.  I asked the guy at the counter and he said he would check with the technician.  He came back shortly thereafter and apologized and said they couldn't do an alignment on my car because it was a VW and they didn't have the right tools.  What a joke.  Thanks for wasting my time.   So I want to CV Pros on East Wash and they had me in and out in an hour!  That's the last time I will get my car serviced at Farm and Fleet in Madison.
0,"I've been to the Urban Tea Loft four times now, and all four times it has been an awful experience. I guess I continued to go because i wanted to support the restaurant and I understand the meaning behind the tea concept, and admire the owner for the fight against cancer.\n\nLet me be honest by saying the food is decent. Mac and cheese is great... SERVICE is extremely slow... Give me a break...we were 1 of 2 tables there.... At the start of the morning... Can't be busy when there's only 9 tables and ONLY 2 were taken up. \n\nMy guy and I ordered bloody mary's... First let me say, there wasn't  any garnish and there wasn't any seasoning in the drink! It was pure tomato juice. Second, we ordered... I ordered French toasts, and my guy ordered the ribeye skillet...I waited ten minutes after I placed my order to check in through yelp... We waited 37 minutes not including the 10 i waited prior...and still no food... So I walked over to the server and politely asked for the check and they kept saying \""are you sure you want it.. Your food is really almost out\"" you kidding me.. Almost out?!  Uh... Let me think.... No crap... I would really like it... Basically she never did what I asked.. Instead she came back with the food... The ribeye...was raw... I ate my French toast cause I was so... hungry! but give me a break... Absolutely no comp on anything... Manager nor the owner didn't even come out to apologize... How ridiculous is this?!!! \n\nI don't like to write bad reviews, This is actually my first...and forgive me for grammar but I just am still so annoyed. I gave this restaurant the benefit of the doubt and every time they have let me down. No excuse for poor service... We paid full price for everything, absolutely nothing was comped and it was obvious I was upset, but wasn't rude.. I just simply said \""I'm sorry, but 47 minutes is a very long time to wait for French toast, so we would like our check and pay for our drinks...\""And I still tipped 20% ask me why?! I have no clue... I've been a server and in no way would I ever let my customers leave unhappy.. I would apologized, get their food comped, get a manager and make sure if they do ever come in again they will be well taken care of. No excuse for such poor service... The Restaurant wasn't busy... I crap bricks when I left!\n\nI don't recommend to eat in.. Maybe order togo, but that's it. The $40 I spent on breakfast I could've been in and out stuffed at BLD. No thank you for the 5th visit... This place really pinched my nerves... 4 visits and each visit has always been extremely slow...restaurant is too small to be overwhelm when the restaurant isn't even full... 2 servers for 9 tables... Please don't tell me it's too much to handle. Well, I will never return here again... Those who have gone here and have gotten great service and didn't have as long of a wait for food.. GOOD FOR YOU! They need customers somewhere and somehow."
3,"My boyfriend and I went for the first time on this past Sunday. We heard lots of good things about Eddie V's but simply hadn't made it over to visit them yet. So glad we opted to go on Sunday night for dinner! They had live jazz music, stunning ambience, fabulous service, and the food was delicious! We decided to move with appetizer shared plates and chose three: first course was the crabcake, which is a great portion approximately 7 ounces and very well done. The next course were potstickers that were outstanding and not too salty. The final course were the lobster tacos-which are incredible-great portion and lots of amazing flavors!  As cocktails we shared Rombauer Chardonnay three glasses for him and three glasses for me which was very nice. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and will go back again soon! I absolutely recommend Eddie V's and hope that you enjoy as much as we did!"
3,"Very nice Asian market with a foodcourt. It's like a mini mall with different stores and restaurants and a food court.  I go here from time to time and love to eat lunch before I do my grocery shopping.  I just went the other day and there was a lot more vendors in the food court and the bakery finally opened up.  At the bakery I got a cream bun, which was yummy with airy and light bread and creamy custard filling.  I also got some cocunut bun thing and the filling was grainy and way too sweet. I also bought a bag of sho-pow with pork and veggie filling and it was pretty good, but later wished I got the honey bbq pork instead."
4,Easily my favorite place to eat in Madison.  Great Lao-Thai food.  Curries are fantastic and make sure to start with a soup.  They're always good.  Tip: place is tiny and you will wait.  Either get carry out or head across the street to the Weary Traveler to grab a beer while you wait for your table.
4,"This is the best place (IMO) that delivers to Troy Hill.  Please allow an hour at least for delivery.  It is worth it.\n\nIn the past I've had the regular pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, etc) from there.  Always delicious.  Today I decided to try some of their other selections:\n\nMoroccan Spiced Chicken and Dry Plum Pizza (SOO GOOD)\nPide with Pastirma (WONDERFUL)\nBeets (I had a craving.  Really really good!)\n\nDelivery was only 5 minutes past the GrubHub estimate.  Driver polite and friendly as has always been my experience with them.\n\nI'm usually stingy with the stars, but as it is so hard to find good food delivered to Troy Hill (not counting using Meals Delivered), I'm going for it.  Five stars!"
0,"Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here!  The food at this place is absolutely disgusting!  The soup was so salty and tasted like muddy water.  The rib appetizer wasn't even edible!  It was like it had been made a week earlier.  The foil wrap chicken app was some mysterious pieces of chicken stuffed in foil with salt!  Disgusting!  The sweet & sour pork was seriously like chewing on shoe leather! It had no flavor whatsoever....like it had been boiled to death.  The lo-mein wasn't any better.  It was so salty that you couldn't even eat it!  I hadn't been to this place for about 10 years, due to the last experience I had here.  Made a huge mistake thinking it got better after 10 years.  Not even a little bit better!  Save your money!  Panda Express blows this place away!  And I'm not a big fan of that place either....but at least the food is fresh!  I don't know how China Inn even keeps it's doors open!  Very strange cause there is rarely cars there...hmmm."
0,"Not impressed right off the bat. In a weird location right next to another mattress store. Walking in felt pressure right off the bat. \n\nWhen I mentioned I was just looking, I was quickly dismissed. We are needing three new mattresses and will be looking elsewhere. We suggest anyone else does as well."
0,"Such a disappointment.  My wife and I are huge Beatles fans.  We have never seen a cirque show before, so we were thrilled to get the chance.  This did not live up to expectation. There were three \""stunts\"" that wowed us, but we were expecting a show of that.  It was much more of a dance performance than a circus performance, and one without a coherent message or story at that."
2,"Loved the name of this place, so i needed to investigate another happy hour. This HH goes til 7 with 1/2 price beer and a food specials menu consisting mostly of bar stuff. The $2 pretzel was killer; hot and buttery and had a decent queso dip on side. Not the same luck on the $4 street tacos. The chicken is thigh meat and the steak had no resemblence to steak or carne asada and the tacos were loaded with too much sauce and cheap cabbage. Pretty average beer selection and not all seats at the bar can view the tv screens. Nice patio though and there was one pizza with potatoes that looked unique that i need to try on next visit.  Not packed at all for monday night football."
1,"Had high expectations going in as Mario Batali had become such a big time famous chef.   Tried several things on the menu and everything was mediocre at best.   I would have thought that Mario could at least of put on some amazing pasta dishes on the menu, but really nothing was all that special.    Would not have mind paying the expensive prices if the food was up to par"
1,"Environment: I felt like I was dining in a cafeteria. It was just one big open room. There was nothing interesting about the decor. Serendipity is supposed to have the reputation of having a cozy and pleasant environment, but this location failed that expectation.\n\nService: The server was friendly which was good except he disappeared after taking my order. Fortunately, the hostess was awesome enough to help me throughout the rest of my meal. The food was taking a bit longer than expected so she was the one that checked on the progress of the food, packed up my doggy bag after I was done, and closed out my check. She is probably the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars.\n\nFood: I ordered a steak sandwich. The steak was waaayyyy too tough to even bite through. Took me MINUTES to get chew one bite of it. I know this place is supposed to be known for their dessert but after already being disappointed, I threw in my towel. \n\nI'd recommend coming here if you're in the mood for an overpriced fancy dessert."
3,"Good breakfast joint. They have all the basics plus the catchy protein pancake. It is good but I'd like fresh blueberries in it, not the canned kind like when you make blueberry muffins."
0,"Worst service EVER! We sat down at a dirty table (because all the tables were dirty) around 12:15 pm. We ordered margaritas on the rocks WITH salt. We got no salt so we waited another 5-10 mins for our salted margs. Then we waited for our order to be taken for about another 10-15 mins while our server was standing next to the kitchen. Well, we ordered and it was NOW 1:57pm and our food was still not to our table. One of us had ordered nachos and at 1:57 they came to tell us they were out of tortilla chips! Are you joking???? That's something they should have known from first hand! I will NEVER go back! I've worked in restaurants since I was 15 and I've never seen any sort of thing like this before! We were not the only table waiting for our food that long either....."
1,The food here is great - my problem with the place is around two things:  ok although a minor problem it still is a consistent problem...every time I go I get a milkshake and every time it is not mixed well enough.  This results in huge chunks of ice cream you have to mash or wait for it to melt.  I dont like that.  The second problem I have with this place is the service.  I have gone four times at varying times of the day and always the service is subpar.  I end of flagging down the waiter for refills and begging for the check again and again.  But the food is good so if you are only interested in the food and the cute atmosphere then this is your place...not for me though.
1,"Now that I have your attention, let me qualify the 2 Star \""award\"". The good: the rooms are excellent; great design and better views. The architecture is captivating, and the prices are acceptable.\nHowever, the shuttle they claim to offer from the airport is pointless for most. Check the online schedule BEFORE you book a flight. The pick up times are sporadic at best.... who wants to wait 2-3 hours for a shuttle? the Taxi will cost $40 w/o tip. When you see the M Resort offer anything \""complimentary\"", its NOT. At best, its a 2 for 1 offer.  Forget the buffet if your time means anything to you.... we stood 15 minutes and moved, I'm not joking, 4 feet! We arrived looking forward to relaxing at their gorgeous pool only to be told that the area is closed through March. We tried to get a glass of wine at the Hostile Grape; oops, closed 3 days a week! And if you like to shop, plan on renting a car because there is none at M, and the hotel is in the middle of NOWHERE. Next time I'll try Green Valley Ranch or South Point."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE! I had Cindy Romney the PA and she not only prescribed me a high dose birth control when I specifically asked for low dose, she was very unhelpful when I had lab tests performed. She has horrible bedside manner and when I called in to get my test results, 1. No one would return my call 2. When I finally got ahold of someone they told me that Romney had put in my file she had spoken to me about my results! I'm appalled. I WISH she would have told me my results so I could have been treated instead of spending the weekend in pain and worried out of my mind."
4,"Hands down favorite restaurant on the strip.  Been here multiple times and it keeps exceeding my taste buds and expectations each and every time.  Try the filet, a bit of a kick!"
0,"I don't get it. I suppose people that live in wealthy neighborhoods will buy, eat and RAVE about anything that is in their \""side of town\"". Lets get real. The pizza here was not only not good, but it was an expensive not good!\nThe crust. Supposedly made with water from NY....Ok... ??? It was charred and burnt. So who cares?\nSauce? I'm not sure if there was any on there but if there was, it had No flavor at all. Cheese? What was there was cooked to complete dry papery bubbles. All I can tell you is that it was white.\nThe pepperoni? Thick and Dime sized??? That is NOT Italian! One basil leaf dried out to a crisp in the middle of the pizza... Why?\n I could throw a Pillsbury biscuit topped with ketchup and Kraft cheese in a fire pit and have it taste better than this stuff! \nOh... and this restaurant doesn't serve ranch dressing. Wow.\nPeople, this is just another chain restaurant with a gimmick. Get over being suckered. Go get a real pizza, have you been to Montesanos?... Or Villa on Sahara and Valley View? How bout Metro?...\nThe noise level and the super bright lighting alone should be all the deterrent you need to turn heel and scram from this place. Not to mention the parking! OMG!!!"
2,Spinning classic 80's and 90's music all night.
2,"This is the first place I got to eat at when I arrived in Montreal.\nThey seated us quickly when we arrived at the restaurant.\n\nThe decor is a little dated and seems as though not much may have changed from it's original state from the 80's? The server was very helpful when we ordered our food, as it was him that suggested our meals.\n\nI ordered a cold cut sandwich, and my friend ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich.  His was far better by leaps and bounds. I wish my sandwich was made with his meat but my tomato and lettuce - it would have been so good. The fries for some reason reminded me of McDonalds fries. We for dessert got the carrot cake to share - it's so big! - and it was good."
1,"Visited UNO on the recommendation of the concierge at my hotel. Parking was a hassle, the restaurant appeared clean but was a slight smell (not a good thing) to the place. \n\nI was seated quickly and my drink order was taken. The bartender was great about refilling me. My order was taken and it was a little slow to come out--the place wasn't that busy.\n\nThe chili was barely warm and too cheesy. I would have loved more chili with my cheese (you know what  I mean!).\n\nI decided on the Tortellacci and it was a poor choice. It was dry, tough and boring."
0,"Although this place accommodated four of us without an appointment, and it SEEMS like an upscale salon, it gets a poor rating from me. Look around, IT'S FILTHY!!!\nI was mortified when Jack cut me THREE times, and blamed ME???? He pressed an empty potion bottle onto each bleeding cut and then threw the bottle back into his drawer, only to grab it again. He took out his instruments from what looked like a sealed, sterilized package, but when he was done, he placed them back into the package and I actually saw him use them on the next customer. He didn't even wash them. Hello...there was blood on them after he cut me. He yells at his \""Salon girl\"" as if she is a slave. It made me so uncomfortable to hear him yell at her, especially with a full salon.\nAt the pedicure stations, the tools were placed in a drawer after use. Aren't these places supposed to pass health inspections? I'm not even trying to be mean. I love to give great reviews, but this place screams germs and unsanitary everything. Don't even get me started on the bathroom.\nI will NEVER return!!!!!! The only reason my review has one star is because It wouldn't allow me to post without."
1,"We passed by the Sandbar & it looked cool & fun so we decided to stop by for dinner with our family. The previous reviews are right, it's more of a bar than a restaurant. It has a great beach bar atmosphere. It would be a cool place to hang out with friends if you are just going there to have fun & snack a little but if you are going for dinner I will advise you that it is more than just 1 $ in rating. My daughter wanted to get just a taco & it was going to be around $10! I usually get mini chimis from other restaurants so I thought I would try theirs. The mini chimis I get at other places come with 8 mini chimis & a side of jalopeno cream cheese. There was only 4 mini chimis on the plate & the jalopeno cream cheese was inside the chimis & no side. They tasted ok but but we were very dissapointed & won't go back."
1,So I usually love coming in here and grabbing a smoothie togo but today I decide to have something to eat. I waited for an hr for my food. If I knew it was going to take this long I would of never ordered anything to eat. I doubt I would have mind if I came in here with someone but I just got off work.
1,"This Hooters is near my house so it's always convienient to come here, but the service and the food is hit or miss. \nI frequent a lot and really enjoy their wings. The server was MIA all night, twice I had ordered wings one flavor-honey thai and i got the new flavor they have- chipotle honey both times. Was not satisfied at all. Server took my drink for refill and never came back after 20 minutes I asked for the check, she sure was quick to come get that. \nThe manager there is rude and unattentive, she accused my friend of \""making a coupon\"" that was on their website and did not want to accept it because she said she didn't know where the coupon came from even though we pulled up the website and showed her the coupon. \n The one that I really enjoy is the one on Alma School, it is a bit of a drive but the food and service is always spot on!"
0,Omigosh! We had reservations and they have COMPLETELY ignored us. Even let another group ahead of us. The hostess is rude and condescending. I will never come here again nor would I recommend this place to anyone.  We are still standing here 45 minutes after we should have been seated!
1,"considering it has Emeril's name on it, i expected way better. sure, the lobster bisque was good, but my steak was extremely, EXTREMELY tough, and although i hate spicy food, my boss said his etouffee had \""no heat\"" for cajan-inspired dish. the service was definitely lacking both in friendliness and speed. come on, you guys can do way better...but next time, Wolfgang Puck."
3,"This is one of the best quality Mediterranean places in Las Vegas.  As a local we have tried everywhere, and this is among the top 5.  The Chicken Kabob is the best in Vegas.  Tender, seasoned and grilled perfectly.  Always cooked to order.  The specialty platters are enormous, so don't order unless you are hungry.  The Greek Salad has a near perfect light and flavorful dressing, the only downside is depending on who is in the kitchen you may get overly large lettuce chunks which makes eating awkward.  It is recommended you ask them to toss your salad for you, it will evenly spread the dressing and Fetta around - completely changes the flavor and quality.\n\nIf you like hummus, get the hummus with seasoned beef. Out of this world and simple but flavorful.  \n\nThe decor and ambience are the only downsides.  You feel like you are in a covered hotel banquet room, or having dinner at a retirement home. The lighting, background music, and overall space are a 2 out of 5. \n\nService is a hit or miss.  A few of the staff there are fantastic, but, they randomly handle tables and so you sometimes may wait to get acknowledged.  However, the food quality if worth the wait.\n\nWARNING:  Ordering to-go is a painful experience unless you tell them you will be there in 15-20 minutes.  I have ordered sometimes, showed up 45 minutes later, and they were still not ready.  If you don't tell them you need it fast, you will wait a while. And walk-in takeout is the worst - just plan on a long wait."
4,"Top's is amazing.  I love going there.  Their beer selection is fantastic and the customer service is awesome.  You don't feel like you're at a store.  You feel like your friend just so happens to own a liquor store.  You will get no scornful looks from cashiers for coming in already drunk.\n\nOne time I popped in and some salesman was there, wearing a Russian Commandant uniform, trying to sell Kalashnikov vodka.  \""He made AK-47's and vodka, too!\""  What a guy.  I didn't buy any.  The way I see it, Top's, if you're gonna have a salesman in your place, that was the guy to have.  I was pleasantly weirded out.\n\nI vouch for Top's.  It's a great little liquor store."
3,Tried Archies cafe for the first time. The service was great and the food was the best Tai food I've had so far. I ordered the Pad Tai 6 on the spicey scale and it could have been a little hotter. It is a great atmosphere and overall a great restaurant.
4,"We stopped here for a Friday night date night. It was our first visit and we'll definitely return! The food, the service, affordability and ambience are all excellent! On our \""keeper\"" list for sure!"
4,"I went to this place alone, around 3 PM on a Thursday, and it was pretty deserted. There weren't many people around, so I felt like I had the museum pretty much all to myself. The art is very contemporary and much of it takes up a large, open space. The museum seemed to follow a \""Open/Inner Space\"" theme. This is stuff you'd find in Phaidon's Cream series, if you're into those. There's a large variety of art as well. I really liked Sarah Oppenheimer's work. There would be a large red block on the wall, but as you got closer you'd realize it's actually created by a red light coming through a large hole in the ceiling. Go check it out!"
0,"Planned to go there last Sunday because of all the great things we had heard about this place!  WELL, to our surprise, they were not open!!!  the huge NOW OPEN sign was hanging in the window, the hours on the door said they were open -- there were a few people inside, looked like they were cleaning the kitchen area or something........ but alas, all the doors were locked and the people inside completely ignored us!!  At least take down the huge NOW OPEN banner in the window!!!  Or post a sign on the door explaining why you would be locked up during your business hours!!!"
0,"My guess is that \""Ruth K.\"" was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner.  Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop, run by someone with good business sense.  What kind of a \""business\"" only prepares food (chicken/tuna salad, hummus) once a week?  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge?  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!\n\nBTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.\n\nAdded note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition. I asked for a refund, and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers. That was the last straw.  I won't spend another dollar there."
2,"i nom nom nommed at the pyramid cafe because of it's convenience, open 24 hours. few things are \""cheap\"" in vegas but the cheeseburger was a good value for it's price. i got it with fries and having not eatens for almost a whole days, i still couldn't nom nom nom the whole burgers or fries. i got it to goes and they packed it with all sorts of condiments. i had enough leftovers from that nights to last me the next day but then again, i are a small cat. i was satisfied with the portions and the way it was prepared (grilled buns, nicely melted cheese, evenly cooked fries) and overall, it was a good, simple staple meal but not amazing. i would orders it again if i was cravings it though."
1,"Have been to several buffets in Vegas and this one is NOT worth the hype.  Food is no better than others, the plates are \""hidden\"" and inconvenient to get to, the service was horrible.  Had to ask for refills on drinks several times and they were extremely slow about removing plates.  For the price I would have expected a bigger selection of \""side dishes\"". Desserts were by far the best of  all their items.  Won't go back."
0,"Yes, the food tastes terrific, and the prices are MORE than reasonable.\n\nBut the OWNER (Joseph Zanelli) is incredibly rude and unfriendly.  So are SOME of his servers.\n\nI used to go there every Sunday afternoon for about 3 hours, with my friends.\n\nWe don't go there anymore, and we will NEVER RETURN.\n\n If I want to be treated rudely, I'll re-marry my first wife.\n\nAvoid this place and avoid Joseph Zanelli.  You don't need the kind of discourteous treatment he offers the public."
1,"Fish was good, atmosphere stunk, service was incredibly slow, and it seemed like a cross between red lobster and chilis.\n\nAlthough my food was good it took about 15 minutes to order my appetizers while eating at the bar which was almost empty.  Then he completely forgot to let me order an entree.  Meanwhile it took 45 minutes to get my appetizer.  The entree came pretty promptly thereafter though.  \n\nOverall it is good fish and it is very cheap but not sure it is worth it."
3,My friends and I had lunch after the duck tour. The honey mustard chicken sandwich was very good. Burgers and chicken fingers were also very good. Mac and cheese sounded good but was disappointing. The cheese sauce was not thick enough and not cheesy enough. \nI had the best mojotio at the Aruba Hard Rock Cafe on vacation. I was so looking forward to this drink and it was just ok. We sat outside and it was a beautiful view of the city. Service was good.
2,"This was my second tapas place to visit in Las Vegas. \n\nThe food was ok, nothing really stood out other than the paella. It was a 40 minute wait, but worth it to try at least once!\n\nThe service was top notch, from the moment you walk thru the entrance to the wait staff, manager, everyone made you feel welcome. \n\nThe price, OH THE PRICE!   Only complaint I would say.  The entire menu is seriously over priced, even by Las Vegas Strip standards. It's the reason it will not be coming back. There are far better places to go for tapas on the Vegas strip for a better price & value. And important a better selection.\n\nThe atmosphere is great!  Plenty of light, open, not stuff. It has a bar area as well. The noise level is on the average. And the place is clean, they did a pretty good job clearing the table as you was done.  \n\nAll in all, I thought this place was OK at best.  But there are much much better places to visit."
4,"Really good Sushi, all you can eat menu for 20-25$... pretty reasonable price if you can pack in 25-50 rolls of Sushi in one sitting. Ingredients are always super fresh, the caviar eggs are small and delicious, and the chefs do not get lazy and douse rolls with a mayonaise based sauce to make up for a lack of flavor. Definitely the best Sushi place on the West Side, although there might be some better deals east of downtown that merit a look."
0,"Simple Pros & Cons:\n\nPros:\nGood Location if you're close\n\nCons:\nExtremely unprofessional and rude staff (3 of 3 times I went)\nBy appt were behind in schedule even in the morning - attendance?\n\nPlace was like mid 60s or below, people were staring at each other with fear when AC woudl turn on, while it's 100 outside. \n\nWithout appointment I waited for over an hour then asked staff when might I be finally taken in approximately and was told, \""I don't know\"", so I finally left. \n\nIn Sum - Unless you want mental abuse from the staff, waste of time for the wait, and flu from other people and mid-low 60s freeze, go to the \""normal\"" Summerlin Labcorp, if even a little drive more."
3,"Sweet little place on Rachel that I went to for a bizniss lunch one day. Alexia and I talked seriously about Augusto Boal and theatre in Montreal while munching on the various tiny cute offerings of the lunch buffet.\n\nSmall but staked with 2 kinds of soup: miso and sweet and sour. I had the miso - well made tasty broth filled with tiny tofu cubes and sprouts. Alexia went straight for the buffet mains and I kept looking enviously at her plate filled with sushi, tempura sweet potato, stir-fried veggies and hot and cold noodle dishes. I went up and asked if the batter used on the tempura had eggs and was assured that everything on the lunch buffet is totally vegan. Neat! \n\nI had slices of pineapple for desert.\n\nThis place might not be the most outstandously scrumptious dining experience, but whatev. It's a really cheep buffet that's got yumps in spade and is super close to St Denis theatre and shopping action. Check it out!"
4,Tim!!! You are awesome!!!! Your crew was amazing!! Being from a military family we go through a lot of moves. We've seen the best and the worst. Master Mover by far has been the best movers we've ever experienced. No hidden charges! They take care of your furniture and your home! The crew is very professional. Thanks guys!! GO ARMY!!
3,"First of all, PBR stands for Professional Bull Riding not Pabst Blue Ribbon. I went in expecting hipsters in skinny jeans and got cowboys in skinny jeans. Huh. But it's a cool place to watch football if you don't mind the country scene. Plenty of TVs. They have drink specials from 3-6 and you can get a Bud Light bottle for $3, which is pretty good for Vegas. There's also a mechanical bull for those into that sort of thing.\n\nThey also have a daiquiri stand you can buy from while walking through the mall. They serve daiquiris from 16oz all the way up to 100oz and you can even get an 80oz guitar shaped daiquiri if you feel like being one of those guys. They're not very strong, but if you keep the cup you get a discount when you go back which makes it an ideal way to keep your buzz going while you walk around."
4,"Finally made my long-awaited return, and... okay, not really. I just wanted a cold, sweet treat and didn't want to drive out elsewhere.\n\nI enjoyed this even more than last time. This time, I tasted some of the flavors that I didn't recognize, and I lucked into some really good ones. The first was the gansito, which the employee said is kinda a strawberry / chocolate version of a twinkie (and even had the fluffy cake part). Really enjoyed it except for how my plastic spoon was really doing an awful job at actually separating small pieces of ice cream from the larger mass. Luckily, it did not have a thick and gooey mouth feel, just a creamy and cold one.\n\nThe second flavor that I ate was the rompope, or Mexican eggnog. It definitely has that eggnog quality, but what's more interesting is the presence of raisins. Since Google tells me that rompope probably has rum (\""rom\"") in it, I'm going to call this the Mexican version of rum raisin, which is my favorite classic flavor. Well, except more eggy. I liked it a lot too, and the texture was easier to handle with the spoon.\n\nPrices are just fine for ice cream. One scoop (\""chico\"") is $2.50, two scoops (\""mediano\"") are an almost paltry $3.50, and there's a grande size at $5 that I'm sure will fill me up if I ever get around to trying it. I think the cones are actually free, so I'd definitely suggest get a cone and use your tongue instead of a feeble spoon.\n\nSure, maybe they've had some run-ins with the health department, but doesn't everybody? I have not had diarrhea yet and I'm sure I'm more untidy with the ice cream in my own fridge. Also, it wasn't nearly as warm as last time (possibly owing to earlier time of day, or their fan and whatever A/C is doing work). I will definitely be back when I'm in the area, and I might even try some of the popsicles or mixed desserts next time."
0,"The food was dry , I ordered 5 mini tacos and it was just carne Asada on tortillas .no pico de gallo or cilantro just meat . Ill never go there again"
1,"Man, this place is not a good venue for the over 21 crowd to enjoy a concert. This place has absolutely nothing special about it at all, except some good bands occasionally and a decent patio. My first experience here is when I turned 21 and saw Phunk Junkeez and others, oh wait I didnt get to see them because I got kicked out! Security here sucks, they are big dumb a-holes. I was kicked out shortly after turning 21 for supposedly giving drinks to minors and being drunk. The supposed minors were not even with me and my friends got kicked out also for drinking, which they weren't. I admit I was a lil tipsy, but the bouncers were jerkoffs and didnt believe I was 21 even though they were staring at my id. Oh well that was awhile ago and I have went back reluctantly since then. I saw atmosphere last May, we had to park a mile away over the bridge(lame) and wait in a longass line to get in. Take my shoes off??what? Am I a terrorist now? Give me a break. Anyhow, the bar's drinks are AWFUL and way expensive for the quantity and quality. The show was good though, sound isn't too bad. Why can't they have a few tables and a little decor in the main stage area? I feel like it's a concert in the street. I guess it's so they can pack as many people in, so classiness is not in the agenda. This place is more suited for the under 21 crowd, I guess I just like a lil comfort while enjoying music now, not the moshing type anymore, I'm old, haha."
2,"Unlimited pickles have arrived at jason's. The solo, lonely pickle on the plate has been abolished and now all sandwich ordering patrons can load up on pickles at the salad bar. They are decent pickles with a good crunch. Just imagine if every sandwich you ate in your lifetime came with unlimited pickles, how many per sandwich would you eat? I downed 7 of them with my $6.99 Papa Joe. The sandwich was turkey with roma tomato and pesto aioli and was good, despite being small as it was shoved onto a square of Herb Foccica bread about toilet paper size. There are places with better turkey around, so unless you love pickles, this chain will only be necessary when in a bind. Salad bar is good too on a previous visit, but just throw some chicken or protein on the thing and stop nicle and diming us for everything up there (pickles was just a start)."
2,"I had the brisket and the beef was dry to my taste. My friends had the corn beef and pastrami and overall the corn beef is the best.  Overall, the food is okay.  Not sure i would go back.\n\nI still prefer Schwartz and Abbe's in Montreal, Qc.  2.5 to 3 stars."
1,"I have been to every restaurant that has tried to make it at this location, and let me just say I don't believe this \""Irish\"" Bar (if you can call it that) will break the jinx. \nMy bad experience started the minute I walked in. I was naturally attracted to the large bar in the center of the main room. I sat down and took in the place. Quickly it became apparent that the only thing that made this place Irish was the name on the building. The happy hour menu was filled with US or Sysco food items that had nothing to do with Ireland but who cares if it's good right! So after taking in the place for about 15 solid minutes I was approached by someone I could only assume worked there because he was behind the bar. This large, but not necessarily over weight man was sporting a ball cap, a ripped blue shirt, a pair of khaki shorts and black sneakers with no socks. I had to use this in depth description because he, like the other people behind the bar were not wearing name tags.\nAnyway the large man quickly advised me that I was in the wrong seat because he was saving them for a few \""hot chicks\"" that were coming in later. I looked around at the 8 other empty bar seats and paused to see if he was joking. But after hearing no laughter from him I tucked my tail under my legs and found a new seat. As I looked for another place to sit  I over heard the large man telling some regulars that  he had been up for three days. And that he was tired and needed a shot to wake up. But the odd thing was that even after a shot or 2 he was still tired. Weird! Once at my new seat I waited again to put in my drink order. \nA few minutes later my friend arrived and we decided to order from the happy hour menu. Which by the way is not bad! There are a ton of non Irish things to choose from and the price is right!  However, you have to hail down a bar tender if you want to order because they get distracted with one another and often get into deep conversations about God knows what. And once in these compelling discussions it takes a freight train with strobe lights to get their attention.\nAfter ordering we discovered that the food was good and the beer was cold. We found it refreshing that the kitchen was on top of it and made this reviewer's score move from a 1 star to a solid 2 star. \nThe night went at the same pace and after visiting the dirty bathrooms we made our way home. \nI hope the owners are looking at these reviews and acting on them. If that is the case below are a few things that might help your business succeed:\n\n1. Hire a manager that can keep the staff focused on the guests. \n2. Provide uniforms and make sure they are consistently worn. \n3. Insist that every one who comes in contact with guests are wearing name tags. \n4. Find Irish food items to place on the menu. \n5. Give your staff a day off so they are not tired. \n6. Never let your staff drink on the job!\n\nP.S.  those hot chicks...never showed up! ;)"
2,It's true that Kabul isn't really memorable. But its kabobs are good. It feels like a restaurant on a college campus should ... like it's just managing to get by. It's good food.
