2,"This is getting three stars as an average. The service was horribly slow and the food is great! I keep going back for the food, but that might not be for long. Our office goes quite frequently as it's close, but we are about threw with how slow the service is. It took them exactly 47 mins for our food to get out and another 20 to get our tickets when we asked to get them after we place our order. A word to the wise, be ready to wait!"
3,Great location cool atmosphere inside \nDefinitely a must when in the mood for really good authentic Mexican food...skip chipotle and try this place out. Service was great too! Alpastor was my favorite very unique flavors and not something you can order a lot of places in town.
0,"Office staff can make or break your practice. I found this office through my benefits (ie doctors in an area). I called and make the appointment, expressed at that point that I was looking for BOTH medical and vision, and that there were a provider (in-network) for both. Got a call back later asking for my benefits. I provided both, and was then told that I would need seperate appointments. I said that was fine, and asked for two back-to-back appointments. Apparently, that is a cardinal sin and I was told not possible. Needless to say, I canceled the appointment and will be finding another doctor to try out. I don't see the issue with back-to-back appointments. Anyone else see why this should have been an issue?"
4,"Overall:\nI was extremely happy with this place. Good service, very friendly even though they were very busy, but it was a Sunday afternoon so I can't blame them of course. The environment is absolutely beautiful, I love the little lake and ducks and the people in the restruant were all very lovely people. I will definetly be back to bring my other family members along. The food was very fresh (I had shrimp tacos) and it was very good. Two tacos made me full. Prices? I wouldn't say they are over-priced, for people saying they are over-priced, this is standard for Scottsdale, even though this is Cave Creek area, a lot of us from Scottsdale are very close. :)\nI forgot to add we had to wait 25 minutes for our table, but they did warn us ahead of time, it was worth the wait. :)"
1,Not at all worth it. Front of the car was not clean at all. Paid an extra $5 to have the wheels cleaned and the brake dust still remained on the rims. Will not be going back
2,"The bar has $1 slot machines embedded into the tabletop, I thought that was funny and deeply ironic. Afterall, you can walk out to a nickel slot machine about 15 feet away and play it and get free drinks. Sit at the bar, buy a drink and feed dollar bills into the machine, or spend nickels and get free drinks.  Your choice!\n\nI ate a cobb salad with grilled chicken and thousand island dressing on the side. Meanwhile, the chicken caesar salad looked pretty nice, and I liked the large flat piece baked parmesan that came with the salad. My companion said it tasted good too.\n\nThis restaurant was definitely better than some other places I ate at in the Rio, and this one gets props for being conveniently located to the tower my room was in, and for being open 24 hours.\nMost of the basic dishes, like burgers, salads and sandwiches were in the $10-12 range. \n\nBut, it was nothing culinarily amazing. Service was adequete. Diners at the nearby table were friendly too. But maybe that was because I was eating with cute friends."
3,"This weekend we went to Macayo's to celebrate a birthday.  We had a 7:30 reservation and the table was set up early! I brought a cake to the restaurant and they were nice enough to put it in the refrigerator until we were ready for dessert. Many people in our party have a lot of specific food needs and our server, Kyle, made suggestions to help each individual person. He was so helpful and kind. Our meals were hot and even though there were a lot of special requests, they came out perfect.\nI would go here again"
2,"Coming from the bay area where we seem to have an infinite supply of Indian buffets I can only give this place 3 stars because it wasn't bad but there are some things I did not like:\n\n- The naan was too thin and they have mostly garlic naan.  I asked for plain and they said ok, but they brought out the garlic naan again.\n\n- The selection isn't that great and they don't put out that much food.  I only got two pieces of Tandoori chicken which I had to dig out from the rest of the stuff.\n\n- Also, the spices seems a bit lacking.  Not only am I used to food being a bit more spicy, but just flavor in general seemed to be lacking.  And some of the potatoes dishes the potatoes were undercooked (hard).\n\nAfter reading all the reviews, I guess I expected a lot more.  I'll try something else next time."
3,This place definitely gets big points for being friendly. Their drinks are okay and on par with some of the other boba teas around the area. They love their customers and are not shy about it. (Check out the Polaroid wall to your left corner on the far side of room) Service with a smile and good drinks.
4,"Went on a Saturday night, there was a wait for the dining room so my friends & I sat at the counter, no wait, friendly server, but not at first. Eventually she opened up to us, I think her name was Tannisha? Not sure, something like that. She was friendly & helped my friend that's super picky find something. My other friend & I got the $8.75 prime rib special, came with a veg, potato, salad and prob 12oz (not sure of exact) prime rib cut. It was prepared to our liking, juicy, delicious, great flavor and they offer creamy horseradish too. The three of is ate for $28, can't beat that, my friends aren't local but I am & I'll def be back considering I can walk there!"
2,"Eh, this airport felt a little tired and dirty.  The bathrooms were pretty gross, even though they had attendants.  I think this will be a hub for layovers from my new city and I'm a little bummed about that.  I'm hoping TPTB are planning an upgrade!!"
0,I have been going here for years. It used to be our favorite sushi spot in town however new management just took over last month and we went to try the food and did not like the new style at all. They have completely changed the ways the rolls are made even though they are still the same on the menu. The new staff informed me that I can no longer use our stamp card for ayce which I had already accumulated 8 stamps on this year alone. They also do not engage with the customers as much and refuse to make anything out of the ordinary. When we used to go we had our favorite chefs who took care of us every time. Those chefs all moved and opened their own sushi spot which I tried last week for the first time. It was amazing! I will make the further drive to eat at the new place. It's too bad Sumo 2 had to up and change everything. We have spent tons of money there and referred it to everyone we knew.
4,"Loved that El Hefe Tempe opened up recently! I love the food so I couldn't wait since this location is much closer to my work and I was looking forward to another lunch spot staple! \n\nI went in on a Monday and brought a co-worker and Amber helped us. My co-worker ordred the nachos but had a specific request and I ordered the Camaron Ceviche Tostda's and they were awesome. Amber made sure to come back while they were making our food to confirm with my co-worker her order since it was custom (love that they will do that with any of their menu items since everything is made fresh). Everything came out perfectly. I was such a great lunch and will look forward to going back....\n\nWent back last Friday again with another co-worker! We shared the chips, salsa and guac and that was outstanding! Then we both ordered The Chopped Salad with Steak (her's minus the goat cheese, but I took hers on the side of mine). and that was outstanding! The best salad in my opinion right now. Amber was also our server again and she is so friendly and even rememberd my order from Monday! \n\nThis is a great lunch spot as you can sit inside our outside (nice break from being in the office). \n\nWe have schduled a work happy hour there in the very near future so that will be fun as I know their cocktails are very delicious! \n\nLooking forward going again very soon!!"
1,Not good at all go to the Wynn buffet instead\n\n\nSave your money
2,"Had steamed mussels and clams, which were good. Toast that came up it was too salty and not much flavor. Service was fine. Casual atmosphere."
4,"I played the Venetian Deep Stack poker tournament all month, and I ate at the Grand Lux nearly every day.  Every meal is awesome, I swear to god.  Portions are huge, prices are decent, service is friendly, what more can you ask for?  My favorites are probably the Santa Barbara chicken sandwich and the chicken parmigiana."
0,"If I go back n the next 5yrs(if it last that long) will b 2 soon. I went there on my bday .my twin ordered a vip table an by time I got there which was 1am I couldn't get to my own vip birthday table cuz it was 4 people over(like it was an hour left b4 they closed) I bought a drink and left..4 songs which was usher an then 3 wack songs.thanks alot for wasting my money,time,outfit and most importanly killing my birthday vibe"
1,Slow service.  I got my wrong order. Our bottomless mimosas were soo slow. Though I have to say the food was good.
2,"I was relatively unimpressed. The food was just mediocre, though the portions were great for sharing amongst the 4 of us. Some of the better dishes we had were the shrimp tempura and the beef and mushroom skewers. The calamari would have been better if they had used the same batter as the tempura. We went at an odd hour, so the place was pretty dead, but it's definitely spacious and would be great if they hosted weekly salsa nights or something, I'm not sure if they already do. The staff are very friendly and you can tell they really want you to have a positive experience. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning because there are plenty of other great choices in the vicinity."
2,"Customer service (2/5): \""hello... is anybody there?!?\"" It took a couple of minutes for someone to take our to-go order. The staff wasn't rude but they wasn't friendly either. They look like they were watching the clock and couldn't wait to get off work. Bella Notte seemed like the last place they wanted to be. \n\nFood (3/5) : It taste extremely average! If I was blindfolded and was given three different pizzas to try, definitely wouldn't be able to notice anything distinct besides the thickness of the crush. I only eat cheese pizza so the main part of the pizza for me is the bread and the sauce. The sauce was very regular but I loved the thick crush! I got a half cheese and half pepperoni (my husband ate the other side). That was the first time I saw a restaurant cut up the pepperoni into thin slices... kinda odd but I guess that is their signature. I husband didn't really like it that much.\n\nI would give this restaurant 2 stars but since they made such a thick crust, that deserved another star."
3,"Did I just stumble into a friend's front room? \nIs that the smiliest and most accommodating waitress in a coffee house ever?..oh, hang on there are two of them!\n\nI loved this place as soon as I stumbled across their inconspicuous sign in the street and made my way up the wooden stairs to the first floor. In I walk, the first to cross the threshold that morning I think, and it instantly felt like home. So much so in fact, I stayed there most of the day to work and took advantage of their free WiFi. I even came back for the rest of the week!!\n\nScrambled egg on toast for breakfast one day and porridge the next, both excellent but I do think the menu is a little limited for breakfast or brunch. I know this isn't a restaurant as such, but as I was there all day (and i noticed a number of other WiFi squatters while i was there) I would have really appreciated something a bit more consistent. Kind of a pain in the butt packing up, going for lunch then coming back...damn, am I really that lazy, I had no idea?!\n\nBut, the ladies that serve here are fantastic, very tolerant of my squatting too, the coffee is great and as one whole side is a huge window, the place gets flooded with light and you can sit in the window and watch the world go by on George Street.\n\nI'll be back to Edinburgh, ergo I'll be back to Fredericks!"
0,"The gym is dirty and old and the whole place is extremely smelly.  The \""trainers\"" were rude and uninterested in working with me.  When I complained about the trainers I was told they are really just coaches, but that's not what was said to me when I joined and they sold me a pack with a trainer.  Even if they are just coaches, there's no reason for them to be rude.  The staff was misleading with their sales contract and will say anything to get you to sign.  I was told I could switch to a pay in full plan at anytime, and then when I went to do that, was told that's not possible and there's absolutely no one in the company that can help.  In fact, the billing department said, we'll just cancel you membership and send it to collections instead of finding a resolution, and I was willing to pay them!  I'm not sure what I'll do to resolve the issue, because I've been reading other reviewers that said even if you pay them off they won't cancel your contract and just keep billing you anyway.  I would 100% not recommend joining this gym.  It's not a nice place, the staff isn't helpful, and the contract is a nightmare.  There's a 24 hour fitness just a block away."
2,"We sampled several items on the menu.  The pork sliders were great, the mushroom  burger was great --- and cooked to a perfect medium rare as ordered.  The fries were also quite good with a perfect crunch.  We did not really like the mashed potatoes because the potatoes tasted old.  The biggest disappointment was the buttermilk fried chicken.  Though it was fried to perfection and crispy, it had no flavor--completely devoid of flavor.  If celebrity chef Aaron Sanchez really did create their menu/recipes, he forgot to taste the one he provided for the fried chicken, as no salt was included in this recipe.  Unless the staff forgot it...."
4,"I tell all my customers about the super cool ice cream cafe just down the street from my store.  Great prices and nifty, Thrifty ice cream!!!!  Plus, what an ideal family environment with a large chalk board, board games and electronic games.\nI need to try that Frozen Hot Chocolate next time I am in."
2,"What can we ask for in an airport spot?  I guess decent food, some distraction, a great beer selection and that is what you get at Village Pub.   However; if you just keep your expectations reasonable and focus on the positive; then you will do all right.  The fries, wings and burgers are pretty good and most likely better than airplane food..........\n\nWith that said; if you have a layover and/or time to kill while waiting for your flight you cannot beat this spot for awesome service, lotsa tv's for sports watching and some people watching and a little conversation and laughter.  Sometimes that's more important than awesome food."
0,"I have only had take-out while at work from here. I would never go there to eat. What is the deal with the giant bread? I can never order anything hot because it won't be when I get it. I kow a lot of people like it and maybe it is what they order and what I order, but I just have NEVER liked anything I have gotten from this place!"
1,Eh. Not my favorite. Went for lunch and only had 30 min. Older lady was there and didn't speak very good English. Chinglish is more like it. Food was mediocre. Not appetizing. They should try harder. Oh and our server was picking her nose. Yum!
4,"Having discovered this place using Yelp and UrbanSpoon, I feel as if we just stumbled on a jewel for Chinese food in the Fort Mill / Tega Cay area. Here's the skinny on why this place gets five stars: \n\n1. Value - excellent pricing for good portions. I mean REALLY excellent pricing. \n\n2. Quality - excellent quality of food. I am a Sesame Chicken snob - not too sweet and well cooked. \n\n3. Cleanliness - Bathrooms were clean (a stickler for me), and quite a bit of care has gone into the details of the interior with a nice design. \n\nI really hope Peking Tokyo stays around...good food, friendly staff, clean environment and affordable. \n\nKeep up the good work Peking Tokyo!"
1,"Came here for Goyemon's 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event. They required reservations to be made, by request, from a site, that was posted through their facebook (www.mongroupevent.com). Reservations was first come, first serve. The reservation request form was simple to fill out, name, contact info, number of people, times wanted. I was surprised by this because I got no e-mail confirmation or anything. I had called a few days prior, and the girl who picked up a phone, said she had a list on a paper she found, under correct time and # of people, but had no info if it was confirmed. 2 days ago, (monday, i wanted wednesday), is when i received a confirmation text. \n\nUpon arrival, our reservation was for 7:30. We arrived around 7pm. I had went in to ask to double-check my reservation. Was all good so went outside to sit and wait. There was another yelper there, Chris V., who had an reservation for 7pm, who was still waiting. Doriee and I were like, okay, they are a little backed up. No worries. She glanced into the restaurant to look at the blackboard, where they usually had their specials written. Toro was no where to be found on the menu. I mean sure, it was not on the original \""promised\"" special items on their site (blue fin tuna, wagyu beef, foie gras), but day before, many have said they had AYCE toro. That got us really excited prior to arrival. By 7:35, i had went inside and asked to see the estimated time on wait before we get a table. She glanced around the dining area and she said there is a table whos paying, and will be leaving soon. Ok ! ... wait a minute ... Chris' reservation is 7pm.... so i went outside and waited. Less than a few minutes late, my name was called. UHHHH !!!??? OK THATS WEIRD.... Later we saw they were seated AFTER us. That's bad on their part. They've been waiting here since before we arrived too.... Just because i went in to ask, i got table faster? \n\nSO ANYWAY.....\n\nWhen our waitress came up to us to take our drink order, we had asked what was avail today and if toro was AYCE today. NOPE. Toro is limit 1 per person. Same for the Foie Gras nigiri. Wagyu beef, sea urchin, and blue fin tuna is AYCE. DANG IT ! sad. SAD!. SUPER SAD ! IMO thats a bad management on their part. Why allow AYCE one day, and be super limited the next? In my opinion, to manage better, to allow maybe like, 5 orders per person. That way, each who wants, gets a fair amount, and not be SUPER limited, but not be free to order. Bad call on their part. Also, as they had posted on their FB on 2nd day, items are avail until they run out? Uhm, there's a reason why you had a reservation to begin with. To limit the amount of people you have these two days. Not only did you have AYCE one day and not the other, you allowed walk-in's as well. Though it may have been \""Said\"" that its a 1 hour limit on eating time but it is NOT enforced. People sit around and socialize after the end of their meal. No good ! Control and manage better ! \n\nWith that, already a bad start. Doriee and my friend are already upset but we decided to stay and eat, since we were there already. \n\nOrdered 3 toro, 3 amaebi, 3 foie gras, 5 blue fin, 5 yellow tail, salmon, 3 kobe beef, and a half of a 9-1-1 roll to start. \n\nBlue Fin Tuna, was fresh. Each fish piece was actually cut fairly thick. \n\nWagyu Beef Nigiri. First 3 orders. VERY thin and \""broken\"" cuts of meat. Like it ripped open because they sliced too thin. Meat was not tender, as what a high quality meat should be. The \""carrot?\"" topping was a bit weird. Ponzu? sauce used made it weird as well. Was not a good combination at all. poorly executed. \n\nFoie Gras Nigiri - topped with, i believe, fried onions?, seared foie gras, and probably an unagi (or similar) sauce? That was weird too. the sauce used covered the taste of the foie gras. You can really taste the foie gras if you ate a straight up piece, untouched with anything but, in combination with the fried onions, sauce, and rice. flavors gone. poor executed as well, in my opinion. \n\nToro Nigiri (fatty tuna) - the most sought after order. considering we were limited to ONE order per person on the SECOND night of their event, we tried our best to \""Savor\"" the pieces. With my experience with toro, it is supposed to be naturally sweet, super fatty and tender, little to no chewing needed. This toro, thinly cut. not as tender and soft. Some chewy bits as well. SAD ! \n\nAmaebi Nigiri (Sweet shrimp) - this wasnt bad. granted neither of the people i went wanted to eat it, so i ate all 3 orders. Size of the amaebi was actually fairly large. larger than normal actually. nice and sweet, and gives a nice \""bite\"" texture. fresh. \n\nUni Nigiri (Sea Urchin) - considering their no limit on sea urchin, i had high hopes for this as well. Considering their fast usage, i was expecting fresh and sweet. Nope. little to no sweet taste. okay freshness. \n\nOverall experience, meh. Had high hopes for this event, looked forward to it, but was quite the disappoint."
3,"Have been going here for over 6 years and love it.  This is a true cowboy style restaurant with an all you can eat basic salad bar, cowboy beans & toast, potatoes, and all the common meat options.  The food is usually good.  The atmosphere is the best part, low key and awesome views.  If you live in Laveen or South Phoenix you should frequent the place.  They have locally crafted delicious brews.  We love to ride horses or motorcycles here, watch the sunset and chat it up with the locals and the workers.  Favorite restaurant in Laveen!  Hitching posts out back if you want to ride your horse here.  Very close (walking distance) to South Mountain trail head too."
1,"Went there a couple night ago with my boyfriend. The girl who gave me a message was not even modestly good. I should have asked for someone else 10 minutes in. She actually hurt me, because the next day I could Hardly move my neck...ITS SUPPOSED TO BE A FOOT MASSAGE!"
2,"Krispy Kreme Back in the Valley.......wohooooo.....wait....wait....wait....I can't get that excited because they need to make a few improvements. I was very disappointed to find out they don't carry the Creme filled Glazed Doughnuts anymore. While the Chocolate Coated Creme filled doughnuts are good.....the Glazed one's would make you slap the person standing next to you. If you were alone in the store you would slap yourself....LOL...that is how good they were. The location itself is also tricky because if your traveling West bound you have to make a U turn to get back to the establishment because it sits between 2 other stores. Finally the staff....OMG....they are all over the place....I mean that is the best way I can describe it. I guess you could just chalk it up to youth....but they really need to get there act together or this Krispy Kreme will disappear from the Valley soon. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
2,"This place is A-OK in my book!  We called in our order to pick up. The lady was so friendly and helpful.  She asked me if I had any coupons...  rare that I didn't have one.  I asked her where I could get one and she told us Smith's had coupons on the back of their receipts.  Before my husband went to pick it up, I found an old receipt!  Score!  $5 off of 20.  Nice!  There is also 25% off if you check in with Yelp. I found this afterwards... I can always use it next time. When he picked up our dinner, great service from her in person!   We love that!\n\nI tried the Chicken Bomb Sandwich.  It had everything on a sandwich that I love... mushrooms, peppers, onions and chicken! Yum! I also got a side of their Clam Chowder.  (Also a fav of  mine!) The sandwich was stuffed with all of the ingredients. The mixture was very tasty.   The roll, however, was very soggy.  Maybe it would've been different if we ate there. I would have added a star if it was toasted. Just this yelpers opinion.  The Clam Chowder was delicious!  It had a great creamy flavor that actually could have filled my stomach on it's own.  \n\nMy husband ordered Boston's Own Roast Beef 2 way (sauce and cheese).  He added the french fries for a complete meal.  He enjoyed the sandwich. 'A good sandwich, not a great sandwich'... his words.  The fries were ok.  Good but nothing special about them. \n\nOverall we will try different items on the menu next time. It was mentioned by Shirley to try the haddock.  That will be my next order.  Since they are so close to our home, it makes it an easy dinner fix!"
4,A legend. Cheap and bad for you. Fries with gravy is the best. Going to the O is a PGH experience. Enjoy it for what it is a cheap dive bar with greasy food. YUM!!
3,I'm a little biased but generally have had a good time at this place. I liked the food. Good wings but they have changed them somewhat an I liked them better before. Staff is very friendly. Fun atmosphere!! Five it a chance people!! The angry reviews are just that angry.
1,"Roses is a N.C. discount store chain from Henderson that somehow survived near extinction and hitched a ride to east Charlotte.  Its like a cross between Big Lots and K-Mart, circa 1990.  I was mildly excited about the opening of this new location and mildly dissapointed about what I found.\n\nGranted, I had low expectations but holy moly, what did I know?  This store has a random selection of canned grocery goods, ficus trees, cheaply made clothing, housewares, and discount-quality furniture.  Like every other Roses, the selection is sporadic and more-of-the-same. The electronics department has cheap headphones, telephones, and boomboxes and the DVD's are mere $4.  And if you need a cheap coffee table or rocking chairs, here's your store  Bags of pet bedding? Yep!  Hokey AS-SEEN-ON-TV products, got 'em too!\n\nI don't abhor Roses like certain mega-retailer from them-there hills of Arkansas.  Big Lots and Ollie's consistently satisfy my cravings for random stuff at cheap prices.  But if you must satisfy your retail curiosity, please don't visit Roses uninformed."
0,"What a shame.  This use to be a decent place.\n\nFirst they are low balling their advertised rate and then tacking on a $15 per night resort fee.  I think this is deceitful, it amounts to a 30% uplift on the advertised rates.\n\nSecond the wireless internet is $14 per night, holy crap and it died for a whole day while we were there.\n\nThird the beds in our room were seriously hard and old, nasty squeaky mattresses.  I could hear people talking, TVs and people coming and going in the rooms on both sides.  That really annoying in Vegas because people come and go at all hours.\n\nBut the topper was sitting in Marilyns restaurant when my girl looked over my shoulder at the GIANT cockroach sitting on the back of the booth staring at us like we were its next meal.\n\nI mentioned this in a very calm manner to the restaurant staff and they offered nothing but a stunned look and wanting to know exactly where I saw it.  Wow.\n\nI discussed all of these things with the staff at the front desk as well, three days later they credited me for one days internet access.\n\nI guess I should have taken a clue when I was checking in and the desk clerk did not actually look at me even one time, or when the security guards hassled us in the parking lot one morning when we were simply getting in the car to leave for the day acting as if we had not right to be there when we clearly had just walked out of the building that requires a room key to enter.\n\nI will NEVER go back, Vegas is full of great deals that do not require sharing your breakfast with a GIANT cockroach."
0,"Horrible! I just left the place and the nail tech was not a happy man. Did not massage my legs or feet then had the audacity to charge me for a full pedicure instead of the express. The female asian manager equally unpleasant and rushed us out of the salon in the end then when I complained that I wasn't satisfied with the service and felt that I shouldn't pay the full pedicure fee, she disagreed even though the other male tech (not the horrible one) had the horrible tech come back to me to try to give a leg massage AFTER I complained. The horrible unpleasant manager STILL charged me for full pedi. \nHORRIBLE!"
0,"I went there to get lashes and was totally humiliated and told I could only get short lashes that would have spaces in them because my lashes were too short.  My specialist took pictures without my approval and removed the few lashes I had left with a solution that burned my eyes.  She walked away several times.  I feel like she had scheduled another appointment and wanted to rush me outta there.  I have never felt so incriminated for wanting lashes. You go there to get lashes so what is up with that?  My appointment was supposed to be 3 hrs.  Had no problem paying the $249 discounted to $199, but I left feeling hurt and lashed for having no lashes.  \nWent somewhere else and got the whole set and they look amazing!  I will never go there again.  Maybe it was just me, but I was really excited to go there and get lashes.  Everyone was relaxed and I was made to feel very uncomfortable by being told what I needed to get not what I wanted to get.  I'd think twice before I would have Sophia do your lashes."
0,I have brought my Cadillac twice to the service department to be fixed for the same issue. I now have to bring it a third time for the same issue. It is still under warranty. Very disappointed. I expected more from a Cadillac service dept.
2,"I've never been a huge fan of Chipotle, but you do what you have to do when you're pressed for time, looking for some quick proteins, and don't feel like cooking.  First of all, this parking lot is crazy. There's no sense trying to park close to the restaurant. I suggest parking close to Jamba Juice to avoid the linger drivers and the ones not paying attention. As for the restaurant itself, it's clean and they're busy too. Weekdays during lunch time is usually packed with a line that wraps around. But due to their assembly line process, the line goes fairly quick.\n\nChipotle is known for their stacked burritos, their meats with no hormones, and tasty brown rice. What got me going to Chipotle recently is simple...side chicken and side steak to go.  According to Chipotle, a scoop is 4 ounces in case you measure your food.  I've come here and ordered as much as 10 scoops of this stuff. Yes, that's 40 ounces of chicken or steak.  The employees are cool about it, even though they usually have to cook a new batch just for me. Overall, can't complain about this Chipotle. Their busy, but quick. They're always accommodating too. \n\nTIP:  \n-Ask for heaping scoop of steak or chicken. They usually hook it up for me. Sure doesn't hurt to ask.\n-The chicken or steak isn't totally clean eating. Each 4 oz serving has additional 70 calories and 1 gram of carbs due to the seasoning. I'll usually wash this stuff off the steak and chicken. Yes, I wash the taste away. But I'm also eliminating about 70% of the bad stuff too.\n\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (413/500)"
0,"\""AY. F'ING. CARAMBA. How can a dealer get 21 so many times!!!\"" Those were my exact thoughts about 4 shoes into the $5 black jack table at O'Sheas. Right around the time when I was reevaluating why I ever stepped foot into this tiny, cramped, stuffy joint instead of seeking out a giant alcoholic beverage.\n\nI know this sounds riidiculous but I swear the black jack here is rigged! 4-5 shoes and NO ONE at the completely full table was hitting any ounce of a winning streak. The dealer was hitting black jack, 21, and 20 like nobody's business. I swear it's something with that automatic shuffling device they got goin' on there! I'm on to you O'Sheas!\n\nAfter losing about 2 years of my life in extra-stuffy second hand smoke, and one very crappy daquiri later, I decided enough was enough and left this place about 40 bucks in the hole. Yeah, not a big deal but this experience seriously sucked. I never missed my hotel's beautiful and well ventilated casino so much until I gambled here. UGH. It gets one star for the legit band that was playing, that's it!"
2,"Aaaah what happened to you?? This was my favorite Italian restaurant of ALL time. I am sad to say that I will have to find a new spot:( \n\nI spoke so highly of Nora's, so when it was girl's night out, we had this place in mind. Parking can be a pain during the dinner rush because there are like 10 businesses sharing 50 spots. Make sure to give yourself some time for that. As for the restaurant itself, don't let the exterior fool you. The inside is nicer than the outside. To the right of the restaurant is the bar/lounge area and to the left is the more lit up family area. \n\nService was pretty normal. Nothing special, she was nice and did her job. The average rating goes towards the food. Like I said, this WAS my favorite spot until now. Let me explain why. \n\nGarlic Bread: a few years ago it used to be thick slices of bread covered in butter with huge chunks of garlic right there staring at you. Bad breath for hours, but so good. Now, it's thin slices of bread with just garlic flavored butter. It's like something you could have bought in the frozen food section. \n\nAppetizers: Cesar salad was pretty boring. And $5 for a few pieces of lettuce was way overpriced. The truffle fries were pretty boring too. Just plain French fries sprinkled with Parmesan. Boring all around. The fries did have a good crisp though. \n\nEggplant Parmesan: this is the ONLY thing I order off the menu. Pan fried eggplant covered with marinara sauce and mozzarella served with a side of spaghetti. Sounds good right? It was before. This visit I got a pile of mush. Maybe because they messed up my friend's pizza order so my dish was probably just chillin. Very disappointed. \n\nAll in all, I probably won't come back to Nora's. It still beats Olive Garden, but maybe I'll just stick with Bootlegger's from now on."
3,"I like to have a nightcap here when I'm staying at the Fairmont. Drinks are proper for the most part, the food is decent, and the people-watching is always entertaining. Prices are appropriate to the hotel it's situated in; this is not the Days Inn, folks. Generally a good place to unwind if you have a few bucks to drop."
2,"This place is really cool, I like how they have all the different foods of the world here, however it is not as good as Wynn, Bellagio, and Planet Hollywood.  I would go here again if I was at the Rio, but not out of my way to eat here..."
1,"The two stars are for Vinnie - he's pretty funny! Most of the jokes I have heard before.. but it was still a good time and kudos to him for working seven nights a week. The reason why I couldn't give any more stars is because I felt like the \""free\"" tickets we received was a total ripoff. Basically we got two free tickets but they have a $16.99 one drink minimum per person. It took the waitress 40 minutes to take our drink order in a small room, and the show was only about an hour or an hour and a half. I found myself searching for the waitress the whole first half to \""make sure I got my monies worth\"" instead of relaxing and enjoying the show. $16.99 is pretty steep, especially since you only get one, and you can only choose from beer, wine, or well. You get those for free when you sit down in the casino! I tried to order a seven and seven (which is well in other bars) but they said no. We both ended up getting a vodka cranberry and it came in a tiny glass full of ice and bright red (i.e. no booze). So sad. AND they don't let you bring in your drinks even though you already pre-paid for one. I really could have used my wine they made me throw away outside :/.\n\nSummary: LOVED Vinnie, strongly disliked the service. In the end it really felt like we got screwed with the \""free\"" tickets and joke of a drink. I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this show. Maybe buy one of his dvds instead and watch it in your room with a bottle of wine!"
0,"One star, because 0 stars isn't an option. \n\nEvery other 1 star review will have the same sad tale of fried tasteless fish squares that don't come with tarter sauce.  Tartar is an extra fee... You get Pirate sauce instead. Pirate sauce is the weakest watery version of the red sauce you get from a Filly B's.  The fries don't even give this place something to save face. \nHonestly? My boyfriend and I went thinking it was a Pete's fish and chips and we were craving it so badly we decided that Pirate's should do the trick.  We were gravely mistaken. I repeat: DO NOT TRUST PIRATES WITH YOUR FISH OR YOUR CHIPS. THEY WILL RUIN THEM, THEN THEY WILL RUIN YOU.\n\nShame on us for not checking Yelp before we let this place rob is out of $15 dollars and a tasty dinner."
1,Ist time dinner at al dente with my wife for Valentine's day phoned 2 book a table to be told luckily had 1 table  left for 6.30. When we arrived we showen 2 our table stuck away in the corner and giving the set menu something they forgot to tell me when I booked the table. The waiter brought us wot we thought was a complimentary glass of bubbly each or so we thought until we got our bill.  Not been a fish eater my choices where limited with 3 starter's I been fish and 2 fish mains so starters we opted for the ravioli and soup and mains my wife for the monk fish and me for the loin of pork served with blue cheese not been a lover of blue cheese I opted not 2 have it. So the starter's came soup quite nice but under seasoned and the ravioli was far from being al dente the only flavoursome part of it was the sage butter sauce. Mains not much better the pork was served with roast veg (a few slithers of red onion and courgette) and a potato flan im still wondering where the flan cane into it not sure if it was mash or boiled potatoes the pork to me was rather dry to We choose the strawberry tir masuo for dessert witch was a complete let down it was more like a cream sponge with half a chopped strawberry on top with a swoosh of chocolate sauce and strawberry coulis. Finished with what I would say was the worst brandy coffee that I've had in any restaurant I've been in. Disappointment is an understatement especially when the bill came and found out we were charged for the bubbly we never ordered.
1,Not very impressed.  The server station at the front door made it so busy and nowhere to stand coming in.   \n\nThe food was bland. The fries weren't  great.  They were shoestring.   \n\nThe waiter never came to the table.  We had to flag one down.  Finally a guy stopped just to get us drinks then nobody ever came back.  Had to again flag a waitress who finally got us a server.  Then towards the end the server seemed like he was pushing us out.
3,"My husband and our friends wanted to eat someplace where we could sit down and relax after a long day, and long walks, so we decided to check out the blues. It was nice. I was expecting a performance, but there wasn't anything going on when we came in, but oh well, their food was still good. The service was great. This is a nice place to come for dinner to relax, chat and sober up. We wouldn't mind coming back here again. I gave it a 4 because it was a little dark in there... I get it, its the theme, but still... I'd like a little more light."
1,"Tao, for all the hype I like just not so happy. \nFirst It took 35 minutes to get inside :(  and we got there at 12 am\nTyga was there the night I went and so so so many people came out to see him, they club was over packed some type of fire hazard rule had to of been crossed. This is a big club but you are shoulder to shoulder with everyone no wiggle room what so ever. \nLeft the main dance floor and hit the reserved area to find someone at a table to enjoy there bottle service, we did and that killed about 1 hour and got liquor in us, because no free drink tickets were given out here!! even tho i PAYED 20.00 dollars to get in! \nAround 2 am the dance floor cleared some and we were able to hit the main floor. The club closed at 4:30 am so you can just imagine how many people were still left.\nThe club looks nice on the inside and was fun but over crowded and the layout was confusing especially with a lot of drunks. by the time the club closed and we all got shuffled out and into the parking structure it was past 5 am... I would never go come here agaiin."
4,"Go go go - fun place to go.  Yes we all got are booties whacked for the shot.  Very friendly place.  I'm not a fan of German food really, but this was really good.  We tried the schnitzel which was yummy.  The lamb shank was delicious.  Lots of food so beware if you order an appetizer.  Just a fun place!"
1,"I am going to have to concur with the previous reviewer on this one.  Although I think they were perfectly friendly towards me, I certainly also had to be proactive about getting my jewelry back, and I was also surprised at the cost.  \n\nI had two clip on earrings converted to posts, which I would consider to be a relatively easy thing to do.  They told me they would call me to tell me when to come and pick it up, and gave themselves a window of two weeks.  I finally called after three weeks, and they told me it would be done in a few days.  It was almost as though if I hadn't called, they would have forgotten to do it, but because I called, they remembered.  I thought that was odd.\n\nThat being said, the quality of the work is superb.  The guy seemed genuinely interested in whether I was happy with his handiwork, so that was nice, but I agree - the pricing seems unreasonably high, and the service does not convey a concern for the customer.  The hours are also nonsensical.  I MIGHT come back again, but I might not."
4,The foods are really good even though we waited for 3hour 15 minutes.\nIt would be better if they move to bigger place
4,"5 star salon...and I'm a guy :-)\n\nTried several other places since we've been coming to Vegas over the past 5 years, but nothing ever came close to Pico Madama - value, service, ambience, talent is stellar!!\n\nI like that you can walk in with your girlfriend and not feel out of place, you both can get a top notch treatment and service. The owner Beli is a delight to talk too, with the biggest and warmest smile to greet you, so welcoming!\n\nXena is my stylist of choice, her hair cutting and styling skills are exceptional. I can't recommend her enough if you're a man looking for that perfect cut, its effortless for her and with her, she's that good. I keep short hair and use zero styling products, but like it edgy and dynamic, so you can imagine the challenge for her and she delivers every single time. I would follow her to the moon for a haircut if I had to :-)  \n\nI even got one of their phyto scalp treatments and my scalp is still thanking me for it. This place is a keeper, can I give it 10 stars? I would if I could :-))))"
3,"Call me a criminal, but I don't like Vegas.  The only reason why I travel there several times a year is because my sister and her family live there.  And the Pinball Hall of Fame is in Vegas.  I usually stay at Boulder Station now because it's close to my sister's house.  And they have bingo every odd hour.\n\nIt's a quiet hotel/casino.  Definitely more for the locals and the Laughlin crowd.  But that's fine by me.  I don't particularly care for the insanity of the Strip.  When I'm not in LA, I like to get away from traffic and people!  \n\nIt's affordable too.  \n\nThe rooms are comfortable, they offer room service, and there is security at the entrance to the hotel tower at night so no local crazies have access to kill you in your sleep."
1,"Been to this loaction twice now.  Food was ok but not for the price i paid for it.  They must be REAL proud of their food & drink....The part that really got me was I brought both of my kids with me on the 2nd visit and they ordered off the \""kids menu\""?  Anyhow, the kids didnt like the food (not thats its coach and willie's fault but kids are picky) as it was a little to gourmet for kids.  However, to charge me for the kids meal and then $3 each for a \""kids\"" drink was crazy.  It ended up costing me $10 for each kid for mac & cheese and a drink.  Usually most resturants include a kids drink with price of kids meal on the kids menu???  Anyhow, if your going to drink beer and watch a game it looks like it would be ok for that but very pricey for what you get....\n\nNot likely ill go back even to watch a game and throw down some drinks with the fellas!"
1,"Tried this place based on the rave reviews.  I do not understand the praise.\n\nHot & Sour soup was the best part of the meal.  Unlike most places, it wasn't loaded with corn starch and it had a nice kick.  On the other hand, there was barely any vinegar flavor, and it reminded me more of a spicy ramen broth than hot & sour.  Had to eat around the overcooked shrimp.  \n\nThere was something on the menu called Twice-Cooked Chicken; I expected it to be chicken that was boiled and then stir-fried (like twice-cooked pork) but it was just the battered chicken chunks from the orange/sesame dishes served in a brown sauce.  My fault for not asking.  The cuts of chicken were nice, but the coating was mushy and spongy, as other reviewers have said.  Sauce was bland.  \n\nIt was hard to pick a vegetarian dish since the restaurant's veggie selection is basically limited to the garnishes that go in the meat dishes.  I went with the Kung Pao Tofu; it had a random chunk of pork in it, and the tofu was so soft it was almost like eating pudding.  Sauce was bland.\n\nSide of fried rice was tasteless.   \n\nRestaurant had good ambiance and the wait staff was attentive.  Entrees were $10 for the tofu and $11 for the chicken, which was a bit high relative to portion size.  I feel that Dragon Wok is trying to be an \""upscale\"" Chinese restaurant in the model of PF Chang's.  PF Chang's is not one of my favorite restaurants, but at least their menu expands beyond the most basic of carry-out standards and they know how to fry their chicken."
0,"Usually we get our pup shaved but with it being late October, we didn't want her to be cold, they suggested the furminator. NOT effective. Our pup is shedding like a mad man and our money is gonzo. Oh well lesson learned."
3,"Coffee line uugghhh! I don't like lines, but there is almost always a reason for them! I get coffee, iced coffee, and I had a gluten free muffin once! I love coffee and when I'm on campus, I get coffee here."
3,"Mmmmmmn this was a very tasty treat after seeing a good movie next door at the Galaxy Theater. I have never been here and it has been awhile since I have had fro yo. This frozen yogurt joint is cute, clean and fun! My buddy Raymond tested a bunch of flavors before making his final decision.\n\nI sampled the chocolate peanut butter cup and cheesecake. The samples are so cute and generous and the lady employee told me I could test every single flavor if I wanted. I decided on the cheesecake and strawberry combo swirl. Mmmm it was so good and I added white chocolate chips and almond pieces.\n\nThis was an Orgasm in my mouth for sure! I could not help but moan a little with every yummy bite. \n\nI will be back and that is no lie!\n\n10% off with a hash tag or check in.\n\nMmmm yum yes!"
3,"Had a great dinner last night for restaurant week. Filet was great, the added lobster was a bit over done but still tasty. Service was terrific! Way to go Ruth Chris staff"
2,Some good sights seeing while at the stadium. Good view from where ever you sit. Had a great time inside and out during the recent Sevens Rugby tournament festivities. But it is old and outdated. OK at best. They should level it and put just off the strip.
4,"I would like to thank the entire staff of Foothills from the front office to the techs and physical therapists....you guys are all wonderful, fun and professional.\nAllen, it is apparent that you love what you do and have a passion to serve your patients. \nThank you very much for all you have done for me and my family, you are truly a blessing!\nLeeana"
1,"Back to two starts from one.  Still a bug problem that is mainly outside but we are dealing with it.  Put in some baits and have the landlord do some sprays.  No improvement yet but I am hopeful.\n\nBreaking a lease is not possible as they stated I'd hava to get robbed and that almost everyone wants to break there lease.\n\nSo these are the facts:\nBugs are present even if you treat for them\nAlmost everyone wants to break their lease\n\nThe one good think is the people who work here truly try to do their best.  They know it's hard to live here so they do what they can..  I had complained of loud barking dogs all night long and although I had to figure out which apartment it came from, they did resolve the problem so thus the two stars.\n\nNice, would you live here after hearing that?\n\nFor anyone wondering on the high reviewers,specifically Holly, I contacted her and apparently she doesn't live here.  She just took a tour and filled out a review.  Therefore she has no idea what it is like to live here.  Would you use her review or someone who has lived here like me.  My experience is not that great but apartment living is very risky and buying a house is also pretty expensive around here as the Master plan south of us is about 300k for anything of which will be build pretty cheaply to save money.  We are in Vegas baby, what do you expect?  Trump palace.\n\nAny one want to rob me?  LMAO"
4,"Normally, my boyfriend and I eat at Ocean Trail every time we go to Talking Stick because we love it so much, but we have heard great things about the buffet. So, this past weekend while we were staying here, we decided it was time to try it. We went for the dinner buffet ($26 bucks, not super cheap, but whatever). It was delicious! First of all, it's the cleanest buffet I've ever been to. Which is nice, because it takes your mind off of the fact that youre about to eat multiple plates of food and hate yourself for it (is there a way NOT to overdo it at a buffet?). I also like the fact that the buffet part and the dining are are separate so you're not looking at the food the whole time you're there. The food was great. We tried several different things but my favorite was the seafood ravioli in vodka sauce- YUM. Also, i thought the best dessert was the cannolis. Anyway, everything we tried was pretty good and we will definitely return one day when we've forgiven ourselves for how much we ate at dinner on Friday. The lunch and breakfast buffets looked like they were about half the price of the dinner so I definitely want to try them out one day. It would be better if they included unlimited drinks too....I can dream."
0,"I was recommended to Joe Ward through my handyman who has worked with him on projects in Scottsdale. He was highly recommended and he was kind enough to visit my home in Wickenburg to give me an estimate to redo my roof. I was so highly impressed by Joe that I immediately signed a contract for him to come, while I was on vacation, and re-roof my home. I came back from my vacation 3 weeks later to find that no work had been performed and was told by my handyman that he had left a number of voice mails with Joe and had not heard from him. I called the 3 to 4 numbers I had for him and never heard back from him as well. I am perplexed that a man, seemingly as nice as Joe, would never get in contact or at the very least, leave some form of message to tell me there was a problem. \nI would forewarn anyone who deals with this contractor to make sure and verify that the work will be done. A written contract apparently means nothing to this gentleman. I was and still am very disappointed that a contractor, who has been in business as long as Joe said he had, would not be professional enough to respond to inquiries as to what was happening."
2,"Most of my experience here is relative based on much more adequately financed water parks in Southern California (Raging Waters & Hurricane Harbor). Big Surf is anything but big; the place is tiny and looks as if the owners are content making their $12 p/person instead of making the investment necessary to make this a serious valley attraction. It's crazy this is the best Phoenix has to offer in terms of water parks. Half the slides were closed for half the day because their \""lifeguards\"" couldn't get out of bed by noon. Chipped and cracked pools, tubes and walkways all give the impression the place has seen better days."
4,"I saw this restaurant featured on Anthony Bourdains without borders and had to try it. We ordered only from the back of the menu for their famed Northern Thai food and did not regret a single item. We ordered the Nam prik ong, Nam kao tod & the Khao soi. The nam kao tod was out of this world I highly recommend it!!!"
0,"I only expect a few things from McDonalds.. I mean.. it's McDonalds. I expect my food to be hot and the people to get my order right. \nNot only did they not have Iced Latte's ready this morning, they also got my order wrong. The dollar menu hash browns include TWO, not ONE. But I guess that's a little difficult for the employees to understand, considering none of them appear to speak any english."
1,"I like to consider myself kind of a big deal in the taco community.  Well if big deal status is conferred on those who spend half of their disposable income on a particular product.  Having established my credentials as such, I have to say I was highly disappointed by Los Tacos.  \n\nThe visit started so well.  The staff was friendly and I love being able to see them make the food right in front of you.  From there it started to slide.\nI saw on the board they had tacos, burritos etc...standard taco shop fare.  Then next to it they have their different type of meats.  I saw tacos were $3.00 so I assumed that covered any type of meat so I ordered two with a soda.  The gal asked if I wanted everything on them and I said sure and then she said that'll be $11.64.  I did a double take on a scale that hasnt been seen since Cousin Larry on the 1980's show \""Perfect Strangers.\""  I asked how it could be that much if tacos were $3.00 and she replied if you get them with everything it becomes close to $5.00.  I downgraded my order to one thinking this must be a pretty big taco for $5.00.  \n\nWell the taco came and needless to say I haven't been this disappointed in size since Pam Anderson had her latest surgery.  I couldnt believe the size to cost, and the additional surcharge for the privilege of guacamole, sour cream and cheese.  The overall taco (I got the al pastor marinated pork) tasted just ok, but certainly it was nothing to write home about.  \n\nThere is so much taco greatness in the world, it'll be hard to get me to come back here.  I mean I will eventually because I always feel a place is worth a second shot and it wasnt terrible, just disappointing (isn't that what my dad said to me when he was made at me as a kid?).\n\nBack onto my business class seat on the taco train...."
2,"This place serves decent dim sum - very good quality I would say.\nBut they kept people waiting in line when there were apparently seats available.  Not sure why??? Were they trying to act like a nightclub just because it was located inside a casino???\n\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT GET SODA THERE!!!\nThere is no free re-fills... and a coke is $4!!! Be careful.... they trick you, too! They don't tell you that they charge for the second one.  They just bring a new one to you, and charge you at the end.... evil!!"
1,"There was so much hype when this place opened I finally rolled in here to check it out.  It was okay but it's so far away from everything civilized that it's hard to imagine people bother to come out this far.  It's set up in such an odd way I got all turned around, there are doors all over which is nice, unless you can't remember which one you came in through.  I walked around for a while looking for a pai gow game but came up short.  Later when I was leaving I noticed a small pit tucked away behind some lounge that takes up a big portion of the casino.  I'm not a fan of the modern look and maybe that's why this casino seems so cold and uninviting to me.  The coffee at Baby Cakes was good but I won't bother coming out here again."
4,"My wife had the 24-pork belly and I had the Kobe burger, both were excellent!!  Friendly staff and great atmosphere, we would highly recommend Urban Vine!\n\nOn the initial review I forgot to add our appetizer (so I'm adding it now), the beer cheese float...just like the rest of our food...outstanding!!!!"
3,"The husband and I popped in here to watch some Sunday football, which turned out to be a highlight of our trip.  The comfy couches, attentive waitress, and good company made for a fun day!  If you work up an appetite after sipping the buckets of Miller Lite beer, I'd recommend getting the potato wedges with marinara.  Be warned that you may not want to share! Yes, they are that good."
2,"The park is pretty clean and spotless. I would say great place for children bcoz they have carousel, playground, and little train ride. However, this place is not for adults bcoz there is nothing to do in here."
4,Such a great spot. Crepes are inspired and delicious. Coffee is delicious. Ambiance is perfect. Only downside is how crowded it can be during peak hours. Otherwise a total gem.
2,"My first experience here was instense. When I first walked in it looks like a fancy rich house that put too many chandeliers in it. The line was ridiculous and if you get there after 11, you mine as well find another club because your not getting in. When I did get in the venue was very nice, but so confusing to get around; it didn't help that kaskade was spinning that night either, so it was packed. i love the outside area where you can just chill and conversate with people if your too hot to stay inside, but can someone give us a map at least of how to get around this place? I didn't even find the hip hop floor until i was leaving. I think this place is way over hyped and it's just an OK club."
4,"Juicy, crispy, and deep fried chicken tenders. What's not to like? Love them, and plus they give military discount! BONUS!"
3,"Best pho I've ever had, hands down, coming from Sacramento, I come from a very heavily vietnamese populated area where pho is always readily available but the stuff here takes the cake. It was bomb af and the portions are heavy, I'll definitely come back here and try the phozilla challenge, win that jackpot, baby!!!"
0,chicken buns werent good. egg custard tart not good. ham and cheese bun not good.
0,"Wow, reading the other reviews here, I can't understand how I had such a horrible experience at Tuvalu. It almost makes me want to give them another shot. Almost, because the place was so obviously mismanaged resulting is such abysmal value and customer service that I can't imagine ever leaving another dollar there. \n\nWe were really expecting a decent lunch after reading reviews, checking out the menu online, and walking in to see such a nice, welcoming space. It was about 1:30 on a beautiful sunday afternoon. It seemed like everything was in our favor. Right until we started ordering. The first thing I tried to order they couldn't make because they'd run out of tabouleh. Okay, places run out of things, no sweat. While I was re-deciding, I heard the clerk tell another customer they were out of tuna. I settled on the Tuvalu salad, at which point the clerk yelled over her shoulder, \""Hey, do we have enough greens to make a salad?\"" After considering a head of leaf lettuce in a grocery store bag, they decided that yes, they could make me a salad.  We also ordered iced tea, which they were out of, and told us it would be 10 minutes for them to make more. We decided that would be fine. We felt bad for them. \n\nSo, we took our seats at a table, perused the gift shop area, which seemed to have nice things, and waited. And waited, and waited. There seemed to be an insane amount of activity going on in the kitchen area considering that there were about 5 people in the whole place and zero food coming out. Eventually our drinks came. About 15 minutes after that, we finally got our sandwich and salad, which were quite frankly pathetic. First, I could have prepared these things in about 90 seconds in my home kitchen. The salad wasn't even tossed! It was, for $8, a small plate of green leaf lettuce (not what I think of when I read \""organic greens\"" on a menu), 4 giant unpeeled cucumber slices, a few slices of feta, and a pile of sunflower seeds and dried cranberries. On the side was a plastic cup of some kind of creamy dressing from a bottle that was certainly not the advertised balsamic vinegarette. My husband's sandwich was basically as advertised, besides missing the tomato that was supposed to be on it. Maybe they were out of tomatoes too and didn't feel like admitting that THEY JUST WEREN'T PREPARED TO MAKE FOOD THAT DAY. It came with a pile of lettuce similar to mine with the same silly dressing. We grimly ate and got out of there as fast as we could. What a waste. \n\nWhoever runs this place clearly has no idea what they're doing. They were out of everything and it took so long to prepare our food that there can't have been any prep work done ahead of time. I hate to see  small business fail, but I just can't see clear to tell anyone to spend money here. $25 for essentially a side salad, a grilled cheese sandwich, and 2 iced teas. Ugh."
3,"I've been brought up to never pay for anything here. I'm always waiting for the hookup (or a date). Don't judge, I can show you the ways. Unfortunately, this means I've only seen like 4 Vegas shows (not including The Lion King which I definitely should have paid for). \nFortunately, the green Jabawockee is my friend and offered me a pair of tickets. So my gauge on how good a show is, is \""Would I have paid for that?\"" The answer, in this case, is an enthusiastic \""heeeeck yeah.\"" \nI LOVE the arts and have so much respect for performers of all kinds. Hip-Hop is my heart so of course I was hype about the bboy element and choreography. I went in completely unaware of what would be presented to me (except for dancing, obviously), so I was pleasantly surprised by the story line and comedic aspects. It's crazy how much emotion they can demonstrate with their bodies without the help of using speech or facial expressions.\n\nWas it just me or were some parts kind of scary???\nThe whole mask thing and then the music and red lights made me nervous!\n\nI digress. \nLong story short, I would have paid for this show, and I'm gonna try and go see it again soon! I was thoroughly entertained, I laughed, not cried, but felt sad, was scared, was hype, got to dance myself, and was astounded by these guys' level of talent."

3,Oktoberfest happens here EVERY night.  It's loud -- when we went there was a band playing louder than a WHO concert -- and the beers were flowing.
4,I absolutely LOVE the Pecan Turtle Sundae. My little one doesn't have a lot of sweets so we decided to try the watermelon sorbet and she loved it! Can't wait to go back!
1,"The pizza was awful. The servers were fine, but the kitchen closed shortly after I arrived at 6:45pm. How is that possible? 7pm kitchen closing on a Friday. No wonder the place was empty. Maybe it's better for lunch. This place has an identity crisis, is it a convenient store, coffee shop, or restaurant? The name of the establishment doesn't help clear up the ambiguity either."

You got EYE DEE?\"" \n\""Er, yes.\"" [shows ID]\n\""Aight.\""\n\nGot a hot dog thrown in my general direction(not for me, someone else's), paid my 99 cents, and thought I would high tail it out of there! But I kept getting stuck behind creepy Downtown Vegas crackhead-lookin' people. Oh God, I need out!\n\nNeedless to say, those Oreos weren't worth walking all the way to the back of this hellhole for. God bless Fremont Street."
4,"Great food! I love the chili cheese fries, chili bowl, and avocado grilled chicken sandwich. They have a variety of food and its all pretty dang good!"
3,"Great chopped salad!  Outdoor area is quaint and has a beautiful view.  I've been there twice, the first time the service was pretty bad-our waitress was a mess, but the second time was the service was excellent.  The ambience and the salad will keep me coming back."
0,Place seemed nice however once we got in the staff was CLUeLEsS! We wanted opi gel nail and the guy kept showing us different brands. To top it all off with Ellen the man looking woman totally botched my cousins nails up. When she asked to redo of fix it she acted clueless. She painted the sides of the skin more than the nail itself. Will never go back to this place. Extremely awful experience. Never again. \nWe even went back and Ellen had the nerve to say what's wrong with it?  I urge people not to go.
0,Don't eat here the chicken smells so bad and they don't even use romaine lettuce in their salad. Glass of Cabernet was from an open bottle tasted so flat! And even when we complained they didn't offer ANYTHING else... $20 salad is better at Mastro's
4,"service here is GREAT! came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. we got hooked up with a nice table right by the window with an awesome view of the strip. our waiter was on it, always coming by asking if we had questions about the menu. he brought out our drinks right away. he was even nice enough to bring out small bowls of salad without any meat in them because one of our friends didn't eat meat. so considerate! we had a party of 8 so we decided to order family style...2 appetizers, 2 salads, 2 entrees with unlimited refills on all food. BEST. IDEA. EVER. we got a taste of everything and there was more than enough food to go around. i love this place! =)"
2,"The froyo selections are just the same as the tons of other froyo spots in the valley. I just have a couple of gripes in terms of the service and drinks they offer.\n\nAside from frozen yogurt, they sell Boba drinks. I ordered the most basic of Boba drinks, a Milk Tea Boba. Because my GF got a cup of yogurt there, thought I'd try out the Boba. Big mistake! The Boba drink took forever to be prepared because the staff didn't start making any of the drinks (mine and two other orders from customers ahead of me) until all orders were in. They had two people working, so there's no excuse. One could have been taking orders working the register while the other prepared the orders. Total lack of organization IMHO. That's fine, I was willing to look past that because I came for the Boba. Now the Boba was just as disappointing if not worst. The Boba was hard and not consistent (some were soft but most were hard and just not edible). The drink was served to me hot with ice so the the drink wasn't even prepared right. \n\nIf you want froyo, this spot will do. Just won't get any drinks or boba from here again! Go next door to the boba shop or to the boba spot net to Lee Lee's Market (I believe it's called Boba Tea House), much better by comparison."
0,"I don't normally review things but this has been a bad foodie week!!! I live a few houses down the block from people pizza pub and was excited to see them open because I had hit their food truck a time or two:)  We went the week they opened. Staff very friendly.But we noticed within two weeks they upped their menu prices and if we can drink 5 beers at home, walking or not why pay $13? They are way over priced, not likely to stay around. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!  Cibo is way better and tastes so much better and is fresh and cheaper:) Trust me this is a place to stay away from!"
1,"My friend and I stopped by one night without reservations, so I had to sit at the bar.  No biggie, I just wanted a pre-concert nibbly & drink.  But... sitting at the bar, I still had to flag down the bartender to get a drink.  She was more interested in making sure she looked just so than getting my happy on bubbly!\nSo finally, after getting a drink order, we decided to order bruschetta.  That shouldn't take too long..its on the appetizer menu, so at most....10 mins.\nAbout 30 mins later, I still couldn't get our bartenders attention for drink refills or to inquire on the delay in our food, so I started talking loudly about not getting to eat.  Finally, the other bartender stopped by to say: \""Wow, it sure is taking a long time to get your bruschetta\"".  Um, yes....so get someone to go check on it please?  At that point, the chic interested in her appearance decided she should probably go see what was taking so long.  She disappeared to the kitchen, and I got hopeful about eating.  A few mins later she reappeared, but only to continue checking out her reflection in chrome and chatting with her coworkers.  Another conversation with me and the other bartender began and went along these lines: \""should bruschetta take 40 mins? I mean its just toppings & toast.  I really would like to eat.  I ordered and appetizer, because I didn't have all night to wait for food\"".  Her response was something like: \""I guess there was a problem in the kitchen, and the guy making appetizers got hurt, so that throws everything out of order\""\n\nummm, ok.  But i have worked in enough restaurants, so you can't tell me that there isn't anyone capable of putting some meat on toast?\n\nSo... finally the manager arrives with the bruschetta, his apologies, and the comment that its on the house.  Yes, it should be.  When I asked as to the delay, the manager said the person making appetizers cut himself very badly and that caused the delay.\n\nWhile I am truly sorry someone cut themselves, and I hope it wasn't serious, I still have to ask... \nwas there no one in the kitchen capable of making bruschetta?\nand what about the crappy bar service, while sitting at the bar?\nand why did I have to ask about my food, why wasn't the bartender all over that?\neven if you had to throw away all the ingredients and start from scratch, you think you could have told me that, rather than ignoring me for 40 mins?\n\n\nSo here is the deal La Bocca.  You have a good and interesting menu, but nothing so unique that you are the only place in town to get it.  There are plenty of other great wine bars, restaurants, and bruschetta peddlers in town."
4,"I come here when I need  mix of Filipino and select Hawaiian dishes when I miss Hawaii. This hits the spot every time. Their staple plate, The Thelma's Special, is always a good choice."
4,"It had been a while since I've been here since I moved but still such a great joint! The chicken wings are lights out, the tuna app was the best I ever had! The place is a great lay out. We played pool for hours. Such a great fun place to hang out. I didn't like the tea sandwich though. Kind of salty and the bread was too thick but that's just me. Everything else was fantastic!"
2,"Arrgh!  We got here only to discover half of it was closed for renovations.  It's a is a \u00a346 million project to renovate museum into a top-notch attraction for people from around the world.  \n\nWe did however see a fascinating exhibit on the Lewis Chessman, which is currently touring Scotland.  These were chess pieces that were discovered in a shipwreck.  We also saw \""Scotland: A Changing Nation\"", which showed how much Scottish society changed in the 20th Century.  We discovered in \""Leaving Scotalnd\"" why more Scots left their homeland during the 20th century than in any other period, and how they made new lives overseas.  My husband Rick particularly enjoyed the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame (even though he's 100% Italian-American) and Jackie Stewart's racing car.  \n\nBut I'd have to say my favorite was \""One Nation, Five Million Voices\"", a  cross-section of people giving their personal views on what it means to be Scottish.  \n\nSo yeah, three stars for the museum while it's under renovation.  I'm sure the place'll be bumped up to five once it reopens in full.  And it is worth a morning's stop."
0,"Okay here we go. \n\nThe first time I went here right after it opened, I was seated quickly, service was great, and what I can remember of the food was positive.\n\nBecause I remember the experience as fairly positive, I wanted to go back with my wife. The first time we tried, it was closed (think it was a Monday). The second time we tried, it was closed... don't remember what day it was - and not the fault of the restaurant really, just unfortunate. The third time we attempted, it was open and packed. We stood in the main waiting area for 15 minutes and not one person approached us... they just ignored us and walked on by. We decided to go across the street instead. We attempted a fourth time, and had the exact same experience as the third time. We decided that we were done with this place.\n\nLast night we were looking for a place to eat dinner, so we decided to give it one more chance. They were open, and had seating near the bar, and on the sidewalk in front of the building; however, you don't get table service out there - they will bring your food, but you have to go inside for everything else. I can deal with that, whatever. We got a few drinks while we were waiting for our food, and not only were they expensive, they were small, and they were not very good. They used a syrup to make it, and you could tell. Very disappointing considering how nice it was outside, and how cool the location is. It'd be a really great place to sit and have several drinks.\n\nSo our food came out. We had the Chorizo tacos and the fish tacos w/ some chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were actually pretty good; however, the tacos were just terrible... and expensive. There was absolutely no flavor in fish tacos, and they were fried. No tasty sauces, and you couldn't even pick out the flavor of the cheese... it was just all very bland. As for the Chorizo tacos, they were a little better only because they had seasoning; however, the meat itself tasted off. We're still debating on if it was actually pork sausage, or fake meat flavored to taste like Chorizo - it said Mexican Pork Sausage on the menu. Needless to say, it was anti-food.\n\nThe worst part of all is that with 4 tacos, chips and salsa and two drinks, and tip the bill was Roughly $40!\n\nMy suggestion is to go to Mexico City for tacos/drinks. They have 2 locations downtown, and I think they just opened one in the South Side. I go there for lunch pretty often. Their tacos taste amazing, and are significantly cheaper and you get complimentary chips and salsa (and least the first round is complimentary). I know the one on Wood St. downtown has a bar, and I imagine the one on the South Side would have to. The locations downtown certainly aren't as cool and the Cantina's location, but if the food, drinks, service and prices suck why does the location even matter?"
0,Worst experience ever die up sells me for wax do the wax tell him to get VIP car wash don't even wash the interior didn't even wipe down the dashboard got no sense will never come back to this place
4,I really like this place. I've been here three times. \n\nThe food is wonderful and so is the service. The menu is pretty straight forward and nothing is too complex or crazy. It's just regular food done really really really well. \n\nThis is one of my top 3 places to eat in Pittsburgh.\n\nOnly comment would be that I actually liked their Regent Square location a bit more than the Oakland one. Felt more cozy.
4,"I love this salon!!! I love Chenda, who's been my stylist for about 6 years now, I love Randy, who always greets me with a smile and a hug when I walk in the door, and I love Kay, the esthetician who gives the best facials on the planet. Seriously, I'd move in if I could."
1,"Now I know.  I didn't realize this was a chain.  After we left my husband said \""I was wondering why you wanted to go to an \""IHOP\"".\""  \n\nFor what it is it was fine; nothing special typical breakfast food.\n\nI had the eggs Benedict; eggs had runny whites, hollandaise was oily (like it sat in the window for a bit),  bacon was nice and thick though.\n\nNick had the apple waffle.  Much better than mine; so I finished it for him.\n\nService was good.  Sorry, but I probably wont be back. Still looking for my holy grail breakfast place."
2,"Food was good. Clam chowder was too runny and lacked clams. Service was friendly but slow after the initial order. Perhaps I'll sit inside next time.\n\nI'll be back, but not before I try a few other places in the area.."
2,I skipped lunch and was running around between Downtown and our training center near Metrocenter.  I know I can always count on this location for a good quick bite to eat.  And it's conveniently located near I-17. \nOn this visit I decided to get their Monday 99\u00a2 special which was 3 rolled tacos (beef).  I also picked up a carne asada burrito for dinner. \nLuckily I had cash. They dont take credit cards and charge you 60\u00a2 to run your debit card. \nI pulled up to the window and picked up my order.  Nothing special other than good quick mexican food.
2,"Good food, great atmosphere and good service. The only really bad thing I can say, is that they are way over priced for what you get. Nice little spot to have a nice meal with your lady if you have some extra money to burn."
4,"Wow!  This place rocks.  We were in town for a seminar and asked a  few people for recommendations on a steakhouse.  This place  seemed to be on a lot of locals radar.  The place was fantastic!  The atmosphere, the food, the drinks- all top notch.  I shared the 48oz double porterhouse with a friend cooked medium rare plus.  It was perfect- juicy and cooked throughout and amazingly on the table within 10 minutes.  The brussel sprouts and sauteed spinach were also delicious.  Had a very generously poured Manhattan served with a refill in the shaker.  The Key Lime Pie, vanilla butter cake and chocolate sin cake were all amazing as well although I would've been content with the dish of fresh whipped cream that accompanied the desserts.  All in all, a very enjoyable experience."
3,"Great food, would highly recommend."
2,"Came through here after an interview at their med school, I was looking for a fun looking place to be around some other students, and grab a bite to eat.  This place was dark, depressing and had a bunch of old people in it.  Why did I come in here?  Some guy who had been to San Francisco was inside and called me in (we were walking around together, I prayed he wasn't going to rob me).\n\n3 stars because the Guinness was well poured (and shamrocked), and the bratswurst was damn good.  \n\nSome younger people came in later, taking shots from plastic condiment cups-must be a Madison thing..."
1,"They provide good service, but are probably one of the most expensive vets on the east side. $110 for an exam/consult and \""lab\"" work for a healthy dog. That didnt include any flea/tick preventive. They are very quick to offer the most expensive services first, then discuss more cost effective alternatives after you say no. Dr. Brittany is very nice and good with my dog."

1,"Alright DoubleTree, let's keep it real. It appears you may have been recently renovated - but it looks kind of like maybe it was done in a rush (read: shoddy work), your plumbing is simply horrible - my sink doesn't drain, the bathtub filled to my calves while showering (yes, with the drain OPEN), and the maintenance man had to come unclog the toilet last night - seriously, and when I arrived yesterday evening (around 7pm) you gave me a barely warm stale cookie. :(\n\nI love DoubleTree hotels, but what was up with this visit? You must have sensed that I'm a Cleveland Browns fan.\n\nSome helpful hints: \n1. The hotel parking is around the side of the building (on the left if you're facing the front), it's a garage but it's valet only ($22/night on weeknights and $20/night on weekends, if I'm not mistaken).\n2. This hotel is about a six minute walk to Market Square... where you can find some good grub (NOLA, Las Velas, Chipotle, or the classic Primanti Bros. to name a few).\n3. If you need something quick, there's a 7/11 attached to the building and a Dunkin Donuts and Qdoba across the street. \n4. The double beds are tiny (& about as soft as a cot), so request a King if you're coming as a couple.\n5. They give you a key to plug into the wall that turns on the room's electricity - so they're environmentally friendly (or cost conscious perhaps)!\n6. The fitness center is open 24 hours - & includes weight machines, floor mats, ellipticals, stationary bikes, and treadmills.\n7. Flat screen TVs in the guest rooms are a nice touch. The $16.99 they wanted me to pay just to watch Bridesmaids, not so much.\n8. The staff was super friendly and was more than happy to accommodate my late check out (1:30pm) request.\n9. Complimentary Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel. \n10. There is a shuttle available that services the Downtown Pittsburgh area on a first-come-first-serve basis.\n\nWhile I wasn't impressed - I'll be back for the cookies."
2,"Kitson and Urban Outfitters are like those cool twins you went to high school with who had a shared and unique killer sense of humor and fashion, except after graduation one went to NYC (UO) and one went to SoCal (Kitson) and they still somehow maintained the same basic style just with slightly different attitudes.\n\nKitson, like UO, has a similar selection of gifts, accessories, and clothing for men and women, along with a few things for children mixed in. This location in particular has an elevator and second floor, where the mens and kids sections reside.\n\nCame here for Grumpy Cat's book release and ended up spending more than expected on gifts for friends- their selection of stat glasses and pillows is among their cooler and more appreciated gift options, but they do have several candles and a limited but carefully curated collection of earrings.\n\nTheir clothing isn't to my liking, but before long I'll probably grab a pair of Ryan Gosling photo-collage leggings... you know, as a joke. \nOr to wear alone in my house as I obsessively watch his entire body...of work."
3,"The donuts are the bomb, but the staff isn't the happiest bunch of peeps, but their kind. Nice place though"
0,"WAY OVER RATED!  Whoever is giving this truck 5 stars needs to get out more, maybe its just there friends?  Burgers are OK, big deal, average burger with some different ingredients.  Fries were the best food there.  I was dying to go for about 2 weeks...... now I won't go back.  Don't believe all these reviews, if you want to waste a lunch go ahead and try it."
3,"When you're in Vegas on the strip and are craving a nice Italian dinner, I highly recommend Todd English's Olive at the Bellagio. Excellent pasta , great customer service, and a prime view of the famous Bellagio water show.\n\nEnjoyed with my family were the following:\n\n- Onion Foccacia (complimentary in your bread basket): perfect tenderness and flavor pact.\n\n- Gnocchi ($32): Did I mention best ever? No? Because I'm not kidding. I've had some good gnocchi in San Francisco and even Florence, Italy - but this plate in particular hit all the right notes in regards to texture and flavor composition. Delicate pillow-y soft gnocchi layered in a beautiful light tomato coulis with pulled chicken, goat cheese, kalamata olives, and toasted pistachios...this is the kind of dish that I'd love to enjoy again and again and again.\n\n- Fettucini Carbonara ($37): ordered this dish bc I've adored a similarly constructed dish at Haven in Oakland. Crab, pancetta, and egg yolks emulsfied in a cream sauce - all the good guilty things in life - how can you go wrong? As a result, the dish was indeed flavorful and the pasta tenderly al-dente, but just a bit too salty for my palate. Overall, very enjoyable, but Chef Kim Alter's version (Smoked Pasta) still remains my #1.\n\n- Prosciutto & Fig Flatbread ($19). Good, but slightly dissapointed. Prosciutto and figs are such a natural flavor combo that you wonder how on earth can you screw this one up? For some sad reason the figs were so overcooked they tasted like prunes. Or, did someone make a horrible decision to use dried figs...and not fresh figs? Regardless, this was the only dish which we had leftovers of.\n\n- Pomegranite Souffle ($14): Though light and custardy as any good souffle and presented elegantly, the pomegranite flavor is no where to be found. It might've been covered up by the creme anglaise and pistachio ice cream.\n\nAll in all, though the prices are a bit on the heftier side for the cuisine, you pay for the view - and the delicious pastas!"
2,"I like going to Modern Art museums, but the National Gallery in Edinburgh somewhat disappoints me unfortunately. \n\nThe art collection is very limited, when compared to those in the MoMa, Guggenheim, Lisbon and other places. The sheer space is vast - there are two separate buildings housing the art. The garden space is magnificent, and the outdoor room cafe is definitely worth a check.\n\nI spent about an hour or so seeing their permanent collections. A nice part is the gift shop as it has some pretty good stuff there.\n\nAdmission is free. If you like to spent a couple of hours on a cloudy day, this may worth a quick look.\n\nAlso, the Lothian bus line does not reach there, so your \u00a33.50 all day bus pass will not get you over. There is another bus line that will get there, but it runs every hour so public transportation is not superb. However, it is a fairly quick, nice walk from the castle (about 15 mins), and not bad if you want to check out the houses and Scottish architecture."
0,Let's be honest and call this place what it really it: a community rec center. The weight room is a joke.
4,"Really Piranha is just an extension of 8 1/2 Ultra Lounge.  However it's an experience all it's own.\n\nIt's a two story dance hall.  There's a VIP section up the stairs.  And they feature DJ's and go-go boys all the time.  It's an awesome place to shake your blues away. I really love the vibe at Piranha.\n\nSo yeah, I guess that's about it. Think of it as a secret dance floor hidden in the back of 8 1/2.  \n\nAlso, for a little history....it used to the the secret girl bar hidden in the back of Angles known as Lace.  Ahh, the good ole' days.\n\nI almost forgot to tell you about the huge tank of live Piranha for all to view. Hence the clubs name.  I like to think that they dunk mean homo's in it to keep them fed. Tee-Hee.  Take that mister sister!"
3,"good food & good desserts. it sucks that they close at 11, & although they were seating people at 1030, we felt very rushed to order desserts due to the kitchen closing, although I know that's how it is, it just sucks that we didn't even get our main food & already had to order desserts."
2,"Quaint little place with limited seating and customers that like to hog them forever. I guess my friend raised my expectations a little too high because the crepe wasn't as good as I was hoping it'd be. \n\nGood serving size for the price and toppings, though. The crepe pastry itself was soft and mild. Usually i like mild but everything was to the point of being flavorless. \n\nThere were yummy-looking pastries and cakes as well. Next time I have money to blow, I'll try some cakes and iced barley tea as well."

We won't come back!"
0,I heard about Pete's fish and chips before sounded good. boy was I wrong! The fish look like a deck of cards and taste like it too. No taste no flavor just tasted like breading. Same as with the shrimp  There is no shrimp taste at all . Spent $14 for two. Why they don't take credit cards as I'd canceled it. If you like the tastes of breading. and reconstipated fish. never again!
3,"DELICIOUS & AUTHENTIC! I stopped by TA on the way to the park and was pleasantly surprised, actually impressed. Anyone familiar with New Zealand and Australian meat pies will have high expectations, like I did, when seeing a sign outside this semi-whole-in-the-wall spot advertising meat pies. TA delivered ... very hot and very fresh, which is the opposite of a complaint, just difficult to wait for it too cool sufficiently before eating. The pastry crust was PERFECT and the fillings delicious.    \n\nThe space is small, very small, and definitely not a dinner destination or for a meal of any great length. I'll reiterate, if you're familiar with how things work in NZ and Australia and how to order and eat meat pies, there's no surprises aside from being 100% satisfied with the food. \n\nI'll be back ... soon"
1,"Sort of a cluster at check-in. They are so scared they might lose a dollar that they RE-VERIFY your insurance by phone once you sign in. That's the main reason they want you to come in 30 minutes BEFORE your actual appointment. The front office is a flurry of people on hold with insurance companies trying to make sure that they get every cent that they can out of you. The MRI experience itself was not too bad. The \""tech\"" asked me a bunch of medical questions that had nothing to do with my MRI. I guess it makes them feel  like their 6 week vocational training certificate makes them knowledgeable? An MRI screen requires TWO questions; 1. Do you have any metal in or on your body? and 2. Do you have any tattoos? (The tattoo question only really applies if it was done prior to the 90's when some inks actually had metallic particles in them, especially the greens and blues.)"
0,"On my second visit (the only reason I went back was that the group I was with picked it) it was even worse.\n\nThe first time they burned my chicken parm, had bad meatballs and the shrimp on the stone was totally tasteless.\n\nThis time, my shrimp cocktail was uncleaned, so I sent it back with instructions to build a whole new one.  When they brought it back, they had evidently just washed it in the sink (as it was dripping) and left my squeezed lemon from the first go round on the plate.\n\nThe pasta fagiola was either overcooked or left in the steam table too long, as the pasta was totally disintegrated... not to mention totally tasteless.\n\nThe severs were kind and apologetic."
2,"Nice and clean, expected for a 4 stars hotel"
2,"The food was actually pretty good.  I think I had the country fried steak sandwich and it was pretty good.  A lot to choose from, and friendly staff in the nice sized dive bar.  I would come back.  They say the burgers are good."
0,"The new management just took over this place and already it's causing big-time problems. They are making changes to resident agreements, regardless of how long the residents have been there. If you were looking for a place with positive customer service this is not the place to go. Also if you are motivated by the price of these apartments you may want to look a little bit further... once all of the fees add up for your monthly rent you may as well be in a luxury apartment complex. In this case you don't get what you pay for... You get less. And don't assume that just because you like the model that you will like your actual apartment because it is not the same."
4,Great place to stay so adventure downtown.  Great staycation.  \n\nThe rooms were nice and the bathroom was amazing.  There is aa nice terrace and pool on the 5th floor with spices growing that they use in the restaurants. \n\nStaff friendly and helpfull
1,"Ah, Boardwalk...how you've changed.\nUsed to go here all the time. Then, they moved from the little hole-in-the-wall storefront to the big, impressive one diagonally across the walk. And they suffered. Had friends down from NY who *always* went there during race week, and they will never go back. Gave it some time, went for lunch during school, and liked it once again. Went Monday night after my 2nd shift, and it was AWFUL. You know it's been a bad experience when the best part was the bouncer checking your ID. The Hostess wasn't at the door and we waited....and waited....and waited. The server on the floor was too absorbed in breathing to acknowledge our presense, even when addressed. In 4 words, she blew us off. Soooo... off we went to the bar. The bartenders were very nice; the bar was very dirty where we sat. For a place with less than 12 patrons, it was ridiculously loud. But... no hostess meant we sat at the bar. Did I mention the server that blew us off? She had tables come in AFTER we sat at the bar, so, no, she wasn't closing the dining room or going off duty, both of which we considered.\nFood was OK, not in the rave category. He had a blackened chicken pita, and I had the coconut shrimp. I think mine was better than his, but...\nHis came with regular fries, and I asked for sweet potato fries- both were cooked correctly, but ruined by way too much salt. Way.Too.Much. Orange sauce was thin, but tasty. \nMy disappointment stems from the buildup I gave my guy on the way to the restaurant. He'd have been happy with The Wine Vault, but I insisted that he'd like the food and atmosphere at the Boardwalk better. My mistake."
4,"Great food, good selection of veg curries at buffet (choose from 6).\n\nFresh and tasty garlic naan.\n\nTastefully done interiors and decor.\n\nClean bathroom with diaper changing station.\n\nOur little one was sleeping, she woke up 10 mins before 3 pm (close) and they accommodated us for 15 mins after close while she ate."
2,"Gee, I've found some things I really like here...and Jo really likes the place.  Yesterday I tried their new Taco Melt (make your own tacos based on melted cheese, taco meat, lettuce, tomato, sour cream - with beans and rice on the side) and it was very good, and plenty large.  Jo had the luncheon burrito and said it was very good.  I've had their fish tacos and they were good.\n\nHey, this isn't true mexican, probably not real tex-mex, but I've never left feeling like I didn't enjoy my food.  And their Gold Rocks margaritas aren't too bad - just a little small!!"
3,"Okay, I've wrestled a cramped hallway, the backs of chairs, and avoided having my head hit by servers rushing around with trays... was it worth the journey?\n\nATMOSPHERE\nThis place is much bigger than it looks with an inside and outside dining area--but it's still cramped! Every inch is stuffed with a human body scuttling about or dining. It may feel hectic, but also give you an energy surge if you like crowds.\n\nFOOD\nOur basil stir-fry, curry, and stewed fish (arg! I forgot the actual name of the dish) smelled as good as they tasted (and tasted as good as they looked) The veggies snapped in my mouth with that crisp texture and the meats were not drowned out by the seasoning. Yet there were still a lot of spices--but easily calmed down via the fluffy white rice. \n\nSERVICE\nThe servers here sure can dance the avoid-running-over-diners dance. Somehow our server still managed to arrive at all the right moments. Despite the crowds, we were also seated in a timely manner but beware, if waits are longer there's not much room inside to wait your turn. Step outside."
4,"I have nothing bad to say about this place. I love the late hours, I love the girls that work there (they are very nice) and I love the frozen yogurt. My favorite is peanut butter with butterfingers and raspberry toppings. Try it, I think you'll like it. Also don't forget the punch card!!! :)"
1,"Even though I'm a gold starwood member, I don't know the specific rank in quality between Sheraton, Westin, W, St. Regis, and whatever else is out there. \n\nBut I've been in plenty of Sheratons and Westins to know this place falls way short. \n\nLocated right behind the Flamingo casino so it's not far on the strip, make sure to tell the cab driver at the Vegas airport to go to the \""Westin Casuarina\"". \n\nWe booked into a deluxe room on what appeared to be a Starwood Preferred Guest floor. I'm not sure the Starwood rooms are supposed better or worse than the regular rooms. But this is what I found. \n\nBathrooms no vent. The TV is really old, not-HD, not really flat-screen, rather small size, no DVD player, and it doesn't have the channel/movie selection that other hotels in the chain do. \n\nTemperature change worked fine. Starbucks coffee grounds for the machine. Sheets clean. iHome on the nightstand. No weird stains on carpet. We could see a view of the pool. If you're thinking of a pool party, this is not a good place to do it.\n\nOverall it was that crummy TV that really put a damper on our visit. First the controller stopped working, call to front desk #1. They got us a new controller. That helped for while. Then the buttons on the actual TV and controller again stopped working, to the point where we couldn't turn it on or off. Call to front desk #2. \n\nThey came in the following day to try to fix it. When we got back from dinner and a couple of bars we tried at it again. TV and controller worked but then it started having issues with channel changes, both on the TV and by the controller. \n\nBy check-out I just noted to them that the damn old thing should probably just be thrown away. They said they'd check it out and apologized sincerely.\n\nNow, I didn't come to Vegas to lounge and watch TV, but it would've been nice to have it on and catch up on some brain-numbing TV or news when getting ready to head out in the morning, etc. I also wanted to note that staff was nothing but courteous and responsive to the ability they were able. But as far as the prized amenities and comfort that a Starwood Hotel is supposed to provide, this falls really short."
2,"Pretty much like most Popeye's. Friendly service and pretty good food, self-serve free soda refills. Unfortunately this place wan't air conditioned the day I went making eating in very uncomfortable."
0,"We just got thrown out of Archie's Deli in Surprise, AZ. What was our horrific crime? Ordering an off-the-menu appetizer, one that my husband has ordered there, and received, at least five times. \n\nToday, the manager refused to do it, saying we would put him out of business if he let everyone order to-go food and eat it in the restaurant. Everyone who? It was mid-afternoon and the place was empty. We told him we would happily pay for the forbidden item (half a pound of hot tongue with a slice of challah), as we always did, but he blew up and told us to get out!\n\nWe are clean-cut, polite adult customers who typically spend $60 every time we go to Archie's. We tip well, love the food, have a good rapport with the staff, and never cause a problem there. This was probably our tenth visit to Archie's, and that manager has seen us before. \n\nThanks to his nasty attitude today, we won't be back, and that's a shame. Archie's has a nice selection of sandwiches, great latkes, and a wonderful selection of classic deli beverages. The sandwiches are big enough to share, but we always buy two and take leftovers home. \n\nIt's unfortunate that this manager didn't have the smarts to sell my husband his tongue and bread--even at a markup. Now he lost our business. $60 every other week adds up, Archie's. In this economy, isn't customer retention important?\n\nThink long and hard before you spend your hard earned money and time here. We won't make that mistake again."
0,"This location was a Groupon find... Won't be back. The girl behind the counter was nice but even though I had the groupon right in front of me, she had to read it several times and I had to explain to her what I was supposed to be getting with it. The red light therapy is a nice idea... But the room the bed was in was lacking. They should hire an exterminator, not leave sticky bug traps down with dead bugs all over the floor where people generally have bare feet... Yuck!!"
2,"As other's have mentioned this is a \""cook your own steak\"" place with a large grill for guests to cook their meat, texas toast, and baked potatoes at. \n\nThe inside is very dated, I feel like for as much money they must make off their extremely high steak prices, surely they could invest some back into the restaurant.. but it still looks the same as it did the first time I went probably 10 years ago. \n\nI for one don't make a habit of coming here, but it's a popular place for birthday parties and special events so I sometimes have no choice. It is unique but if I wanted to grill my own steak I would go start my own grill in my backyard and save about 20 bucks. \n\nThe meat selection is good, and the cuts are definetly the weight you pay for if not more. The worst part of this place is simply the insane price for a steak you cook yourself.. the salad bar not being all that great (the lettuce was very low and picked over quite a bit when I was there), and the fact you are sweating when you get back to the table from standing by a hot grill for the past 15 min cooking your steak. \n\nIt is a cool place don't get me wrong.. and the food is good.. just can't justify the cost."
1,"While the service was great, I was quite disappointed in the meal.  First, everything is ala carte, so you are really paying just $21 for a bowl of spaghetti!  No salad, no sides.  The quality was average, especially given the price.  I would expect either higher quality, or less price."
1,"After all the hype and hoopla...after witnessing the never ending lineups...after months of anticipation...really? I mean....REALLY? People were standing in minus 15 degree celsius weather? I was annoyed from having to wait in the warm entryway for 30 mins! Geez frickin' louise. I really wanted to love Kazu and even forced myself to start over in my opinion once seated, but again....REALLY? Perhaps I lack patience and need more than a few inches of personal space, but I just don't understand why anyone would stand in a line to eat here...the food is good, but is it really that much better than anywhere else? Hell, I'd much rather throw back a bowl of pho a couple doors down at Vip Pho Saigon.  Yes, I realize it's Vietnamese not Japanese...blah blah blah....after not being able to feel my fingers and toes I would have eaten warm ANYTHING.\nThe green tea is made from matcha powder....no biggie, but still to be noted.\nService is fast and extremely friendly...food presentation outstanding....atmosphere is infectious. But the lines and the space just dampen the whole experience.\nWe ate: gyozas...very good. Chicken wings: delicious flavor, but wet...do not order them if you like a crispy wing. Okonomiyaki: the shrimp pancake...I found the pancake to be slightly gummy...all the flavours together were great, would I go back to order this ever again? No. Bibimbap was typical...nothing spectacular. I just don't see the monumental difference between Kazu and any other izakaya resto. Maybe it's a montreal thing. There was a lot of fat on the pork too. ..and I don't mind fat, so I guess  there was TOO much fat on the pork. 48 hour pork: I have read other reviews instructing us to order the 48 hour pork  \""a must have\"".....it was tasty, tender, but again...nothing we couldn't find anywhere else any time of day??!! I mean I could slow cook this with my eyes closed??!!! (I am expecting a major backlash for this statement-ha)\nThe shrimp burger was delicious...out of this world delicious crispy and cream saucy, but the furthest thing from a healthy dish...I may have clogged an artery.  \n\nAll in all, I just kept thinking ....what am I missing? Everything we ate was good and had tried not to be affected with high expectations. Would I jump through hoops to eat there again? No.  Stand in the freezing cold for an entire hour and then knock elbows with my neighbor?  Hell, no. \nHere's one less person that'll be waiting in that line..."
1,Took my girl here for something different as i have been here before and it was great.  Not this time. Service was fine-poor i had to wait over 35 minutes for a fat choy burger while my girl gets her short ribs and rice within 20 is not acceptable.  My girl said the amount of short ribs was about half of what she has had there before and rice was under cooked. My burger was ok  not as juicy as in the past. Server told us that my dish was comimg right up but it was another 15 minutes. There was only  2 tables of two when we arrived and one was already eating.  Poor management by not having more staff.  Only go back if i have some time to kill.  Still waiting for manager to come over.
1,"I may not be the best to review this place since I didn't eat the sushi. The rice and teriyaki chicken were ok, but the rice had a weird taste to it. The tempura vegetables were bland and the desserts lacked flavor. I did enjoy the walnut tarts but that was the extent of what i really liked. Children should be free, especially since I have a child who decided 5 bites of dinner was enough. \nMy husband on the the other hand tried every single sushi roll they had because he liked them so much, so much so he got sick. \nit was my first and probably my last time there."
4,"So happy to have not only frozen yogurt in Ahwatukee, but relatively healthy frozen yogurt at that.  The toddler and I come here often and he always lets me pick the flavor (such a gentleman).  I've been to other locations in California and those seem to have eight flavors and ours always has twelve so that's a big plus.  My favorite is pumpkin, they should have it year round, but I've never had a bad flavor.  My dream flavor though would be a tart yogurt, kind of like Pink Berry or MoJo's.  Maybe I'll right them a letter."
2,"I have to give this place a star just because it reminds me of the Chili's where I used to work many years ago.  The layout is exactly the same.  Lucky for them, because otherwise it would just be mediocre.\n\nThe staff is nice enough, but they don't really do much for me otherwise.  I guess that's actually a good thing, what with all the average service we've seen lately - what happened to people actually caring if you were getting good service?\n\nAs to the food?  There was a time that I didn't want to set foot in a Chili's, but it's been a long (long) time since I worked there, so I don't mind so much anymore, and the selection is really pretty decent.  We had a good variety.\n\nI can never understand why people charge what they do for a plate of macaroni and cheese on the kid's menu (because they can), but apparently it's pretty decent.  I went for the buffalo chicken fajitas, and it was a solid choice, surprisingly.  Not healthy or anything, but not bad.\n\nService was speedy, but not overly friendly.  We may not be back anytime soon, but at least it wasn't a completely bad experience!"
3,"This review is for the chain in general. I will post it here as this is probably the Noodles I have been to the most. I have been to all the Noodles locations in town at least five times and to Noodles in general about 60-80 times over ten years or so.\n\nConsistently fresh and tasty food. Good service. Fast. Easy to customize the pasta (and add lots of veggie). Good value unless you add too many extras. Great pasta. Nice restaurants. Many have outside seating. \n\nThey are a little stingy with veggies that you pay extra for. The extra meat could be cooked better into the meal instead of just lying on top. menu does not change too much so if you go too much you can Noodled out. \n\nDeserves a 4.5 stars (yelp, gives half stars would make giving fair ratings  easier), but is a little closer to 4 than 5."
3,"If I ever have 15-30 minutes that I can take to myself, or need to walk fro Duke Energy Center to the Wachovia buildings, I always hook a right into the Green.  I love the scenery, the people watching, and the sculptures that encompass the area.  The restaurant options are also great - Sandwich Club, Matt's Chicago Dog, Aquavina, some Mexican place, and Fuel pizza.  \n\nThe police have been great about keeping the vagrants out and ensuring this stays a great place for families and professionals to eat lunch and enjoy the outdoors.  I don't know if I'd walk through here alone at night due to the dark corners and shadowed areas, but during the day its great.  The old church attached also adds a nice calming quality when the bell chimes on the hour.\n\nNo wonder this place is Roy G. Biv's middle name."
4,"Believe the hype!!!! Meat is so juicy the green sauce get EXTRA of that bomb!  the spicy pork is so good I've tried taco y taco & some were saying it's pretty much the same NO! It sure isn't el Gordo is thee best from taste, favor && hey it ain't open late for no reason. I live in Cali & the husband I go to gardena it's called the \"" taco truck\"" & we love that place we believe el Gordo tops that place. So try it real good !"
0,"Sorry, but st viator bagels alone are not enough to make a good egg breakfast sandwich. The egg, rather than a whole fried egg, is more like a egg mixture, made to be able to reduce costs. The fruit in a cup is poured directly from a can..yes, a can, and its 5 dollars, the most expensive fruit can I have ever tried. The sandwiches are obviously not fresh and God knows how old the sandwiches are. I expect airport food to be expensive, thats not my complain, but you really need to work hard to screw up a St Viator egg breakfast sandwich, but these guys made it! Congratulations!"
3,An Arcadia restaurant feel in South Scottsdale. Finally! Happy hour is only $1 off f&b which isn't all that great but we still enjoyed. The cocktails were good and food was also reasonably priced and tasty. Will definitely be back.
1,"We really want to like this place...... but for the last 4 times we've tried to buy organic vegetables, they are all horrible in quality. Some even had mold on them! We also bought some Vlasic pickles that we opened when we got home and found them to be rotten with an expiration date of 2 months earlier! Our fault for not check at the store, but I don't know how that could possibly of happened if they were rotating their stock."

0,"well, I have never done business with these folks, but I did see someone driving down I17 in a gray Toyota pickup with big yellow TITLES R US signs throwing his trash out of the window. I suppose I would avoid doing that if I was representing my company that way.\nWhen I need DMV service, I will avoid them."
3,"I came here with three other friends.  We were all on business trip together and walked over from the nearby Sheraton.  \n\nThe place is modern styled for the gen y's with loud music.  It's bad for the boomers with inflexible ear drums.  In fact, there was a DJ there for Thursday night.\n\nI ordered Pork with Pineapple Ginger Sauce, Oyster Mushroom and Clams with Lemon Grass Claypot.  The chopped pork was nicely deep fried, wrapped around a skinny stick of sugar cane and the pineapple ginger sauce was very tasty, maybe a bit on the sweet side.  The Manila clams were really fresh.  I was hoping that the broth was broth but it was just liquid used to boil the clams and it was not salty or tasty enough that I just abandoned it.  The oyster mushroom was very fresh and good.  After these three small plates, I was still hungry.  I had to scavenge my friend's Tofu Curry and some of his rice to get satisfied.  The food is definitely good, fresh and tasty but if you are really hungry, you could spend $25 and still feel a little empty."
1,"There are two possible scenarios here.  One, my anticipation may have resulted in a harsh star rating.  Or, this buffet simply didn't meet my expectation.  I'm leaning towards the latter.\n\n\nAfter reading the reviews, and looking at the pictures, I was excited for the small plate concept, the variety, and beauty.  That is, until I realized that this place was more novel than delicious.  \n\nThe layout is cumbersome, and other than presentation, the food taste more like typical buffet fare than Vegas magic.  The fried chicken, burgers, and lamb chop were under flavored and slightly over cooked.  The seafood choices, for the most part were unimaginative.  My grilled corn was undercooked, individual lasagna overcooked, and the majority of the Asian section was pedestrian.\n\nOn the other hand, I liked the dim sum section, I enjoyed a tasty meatball, brisket, watermelon and feta salad, and steaming the crab was a nice touch.  But after a two hour wait, and $108, it just doesn't add up.  If you must go, go right before brunch, and stay for dinner.  But, if you want a Vegas buffet experience go to the Wynn, Bellagio, and Paris.  I know the Wynn and Bellagio have been suggested forever, but with good reason: they amaze with their ability to make large quantities of food actually taste good.  Although their food is not as trendy as bacchanal, it simply taste better.  The Paris is a bit underrated for their quality and choices."
1,"This place is a joke. Seriously. The service was amazing but if I wanted just service I would go and get a message. I can't believe that this \""Resturant\"" sells itself as a beef/hamburger joint. Get anything but the chilli or hamburgers and you'll be fine; well you'll be but your wallet won't. Stupid overpriced. The best thing I can say is the draft beer is ice cold..."
2,"As far as Cirque shows go, this one wasn't that great. See Love instead. I found this stage very boring since it was not in the middle of the room like others."
2,"Eeeeeeh. More like 2.5 stars. We came in late one night and it seemed like we got rushed out the door by the staff and the sub par Chinese food. The duck was super greasy not crispy. The pork chops were soooooooo salty that I felt my blood pressure rise as I was eating it, way too much MSG. The seafood soup was too bland. I shall give this place another chance by coming here at a decent time."
2,"Decided to try it out when I received a BOGO text message offer during my stay in Vegas.\n\nI thought it would be a good deal and I would be able to try out their burgers . . . .  I was wrong!  \nThe offer was limited to the Les Entr\u00e9es section which was a choice of filet mignon-open faced filet sandwich, supreme de poulet-chicken breast cordon bleu sandwich, steak et fromage-french dip cheesesteak, or the steak frites new york steak.  We decided to have supreme de poulet-chicken breast cordon bleu sandwich and steak et fromage-french dip cheesesteak.\n\nThe food was good nothing to rave about but I would have preferred to try the hamburgers; however, my husband suggested we stick to the \""deal\"" we had gone in for since it was a bit pricey.\n\nRather than leave we decided to stay; food was good, service was quick & employees were attentive, clean restaurant, with lots of TVs.\n\nI did not like the waffle fries, a bit too dry and not much taste.\n\nWould I come back and actually try a burger? ummm..... not sure"
0,The customer service is horrible here. The people serving the food dont look clean. The food is all so greasy and bleh. \nI would not mind if I dont go in there again.
2,"I was able to stay at this beautiful hotel on National American Miss pageant weekend. The room that we got (a standard king size bed room) had a large king size bed, a flat screen TV, a small sitting area with two side chairs and a coffee table, a desk, and a walk-in closet. It also included a bathroom that was almost the size of the large room that had a large tub (enough room for two people) with jets, a standing shower with two shower heads (one on the side and one on the ceiling, two sinks with a large counter space, and a toilet with it's own separate door. The room was large enough to feel like a suite!\n\nWhen we booked a room for the hotel, we asked to have a standard two queen sized bed room because we had a family of four was going to be staying for two nights. Since we could not get the pageant discount rate on a two queen sized bedroom, we just went with the local discount rate of $129/night instead. There were plenty of rooms for a standard king sized bed room, but obviously we were a family of four and would not fit onto a single bed. When we checked in, they told us they did not have anymore standard rooms with queen sized beds and only had king sized bed rooms left. Disappointed, we told them our problem with having a family of four staying in the room. They told us they will have someone bring in a queen sized rolling bed in, so we agreed. When we went to our room, they brought in our rolling bed. The moment that I saw the bed, it was obvious that it was not a queen size, but a twin size. We asked them if we can have another rolling bed and they told us we could not because it would be difficult for the housekeeper to clean the room. In the end, one of us slept on the floor because there was no other way we could have three people sleep comfortably on the king sized bed. \n\nPictures of the pool looked beautiful and large, but when we arrived at the pool it was much smaller than we had thought it was. Plus, the hot tub was a little far from the pool and was gated off from the rest of the pool area. Since it is Vegas and the temperature gets extremely hot here, it was inconvenient for me to walk on the scorching hot ground to get the hot tub. \n\nWhen we checked out, we were charged $139/night so we asked them to make sure we got the local discount rate. Turns out the price of the room fluctuates depending of how booked the hotel is. The price of the room without the discount would have been $189/night instead. If I knew I would have been stuck with a king sized bed instead, I would have asked for the pageant discount rate instead because I would have saved more money booking a room there. \n\nAlso, be warned that the walls are NOT sound proof so you will be able to hear the next door guest turning on and off the faucet, people walking through the halls, the TV blasting, and other sounds as well. We had a guest next to us who had a little girl participating in the pageant. It was 10 o'clock at night and she was running through the halls playing with her new friends, blasting the TV with her door open, having fun with repeatedly turning on and off the faucet, and talking extremely loudly. Turns out, her parents were not present in the room, so this was going on for about two hours before her parents returned to the room."
2,"Great atmosphere, fine food, TERRIBLE PRICES.\n\nI went to this restaurant at the insistence of my girlfriend, who loves Chinese food. Yes, I'm a pushover and I take her pretty much anywhere she wants to go.\n\nI figured, \""why not?\"" I'll give it a whirl. Upon walking in, the atmosphere is incredible. It has a higher class appearance than other dining establishments of its kind. They really went the extra mile to make a nice-looking restaurant, with no annoyances or distractions. Like most other Chinese restaurants around town, this one does have delivery and take-out options.\n\nThe menu has a ton of options, and nearly everything I have had a chance to try here has been very good. Not the best Chinese in the Vegas Valley, but it's definitely good stuff. If you're a fan of Chinese food, you'll most likely enjoy what you get. \n\nThis brings me to my two complaints. First and foremost, the menu does not have pictures of the items or descriptions of them. Casual diners won't know what a good deal of this stuff means. I shouldn't have to ask the waitress what something is - the menu should tell me that. \n\nAnd then comes the BIG complaint - these prices are SKY HIGH. This is the most expensive Chinese restaurant I have ever visited. The food and atmosphere are excellent, but they do not justify said prices. There have been times when I have been able to feed a family of 3 or 4 at Outback (down the street) on less money than it costs 2 to eat here. \n\nIf you've got the money, Amlee has fine food and a great atmosphere. But with these harsh economic times and a shortage of cash in my pocket, I'll be keeping my distance.\n\nFood: B\nService: B+\nAtmosphere: A\nPrices too high"
2,"If you don't care about watching what you eat, you've found the right place. The dishes that I tried were all very good (taste-wise), but you feel like you're carrying twins after you get up from the table. As far as portions go, this place is very generous. Their daily soup offerings are surprisingly very good and some of the best I've had in the Valley so far. The rest of their food is pretty heavy, but alright when it comes to flavor. It kinda borders on bland and not-too-bad. The food's heaviness really over shadows any taste that it might have. In truth, this spot is really \""old money\"" dining on a Friday night, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. If you come here though, be sure to make this your big meal for the day because you're going to feel like you're wearing an inner tube around your waist by the time you're done."
0,"The guy at the door was rude and tried to charge us for drinks even though the package said it was included, then when wetted to leave there limo drivers were talking shit about our group while we were standing there, when I said I can hear you, and it was unacceptable, he said fine you can take a cab then, and walked away. Unbelievable service here from the staff, completely ruins the experience and wasn't cheap"
2,"Overall the tapas plates we tried were okay.  We got a table in less than 15 min on a Friday which was nice, but that was because we were there around 5:30pm.  \n\nWe ordered the curry mussels because this was my favorite thing I tried on the east coast and I have been determined to find a suitable replacement on the west coast.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the sauce was a little more coconut, and a lot less curry than what I have been craving.  \n\nThe patatas bravas were good, I loved the spicy aioli, but I would have preferred a crispier outer layer on the potatoes.  Some of them had it, but most did not.\n\nMy favorite tapas was the tuna peppers, which was surprising because this was not my pick but I am so happy that we ordered it because the dish is delicious, and they have a perfect little kick to them.\n\nAnd finally, I ordered the tortilla de espanola.  I could eat this all day.  While my husband loved the bell pepper vinaigrette, I was not a fan."
1,"Honestly, a very big disappointment.The optician was recommended by a friend of mine, as they had Oliver Peopels frames which I am a big fan of.\nAnyways, explanation of why I have given only 2 stars to this place:\nI had booked a sight test which went great. The optician was polite and explained everything very well. Took about 10 minutes and voila done! And I was very happy to hear that it was free as NHS cover a sight test every 2 years.\nThen they offered to also to try on some glasses. As I said I went there for Oliver Peoples, as I have had these frames before and I absolutely love them. The price of the frame did not surprise me, you pay for quality. However, when I asked if they had similar styles that are a bit more economical, they didn't even have one pair to show me!  Also when it went to the actual lens prices my eyes nearly popped out. They were basically the same amount as the frames! So I left the opticians with the intention to sleep on it and come back the next morning.\nI was actually on the way there next morning as I figured I would not find a cheaper option anywhere else, but on the way there I popped into Specsavers on North Bridge. And surprise, surprise I found nearly the same model, but approximately 3x cheaper. So obviously I went for these! So I gave them the prescription I had gotten the day before in 20 20, but as they couldn't quite understand it they phoned up 20 20 to explain it to them. On the phone the receptionist (I'm guessing) had told the lady at Specsavers that I have to go to their opticians to \""take care of my bill\"" Ehm, I was quite dumbstruck, as the optician had clearly said the day before that NHS would cover my eye test and I hadn't ordered anything. In any way, I felt absolutely embarrassed!!! After a quick chat it turned out that I didn't have to go back to settle no bills (doh), but they didn't even properly explain the prescription to the optician in Specsavers! \nSo long story short, I will not be back in 20 20 anytime soon."
0,"If I could give this no stars I would. I went through the drive thru, ordered a Big Mac combo meal. I opened it and it was soggy. It had definitely been sitting around. My fries were literally half filled. And the big mac had no sauce. I walked in and politely asked them to add sauce. The manager (or whoever it was) told the cashier to inform me that there would be extra charge. First of all, I ordered it WITH sauce. I informed the cashier (since the manager refused to talk to me) that I wasn't  about to pay extra for something done right that I ordered. Nobody was in there when I walked in. So it shouldn't be a problem right? I told them that I work at a mcdonalds, and this isn't how customers should be treated, especially because I was so calm about it. The cashier finally comes back and says, \""they put a lot of sauce\"" and threw the box at me practically. I didn't take a picture but no exaggeration but it was literally COVERED in sauce. I had to use 8 napkins to wipe the sauce off and even then I couldn't even wipe off the excess. So annoying. I called in and asked politely to talk to the manager just to let them know, and they hung up on me. This experience was ridiculous."
1,"Salmon Dry/overcooked..Servers are pleasant...but service a bit sloooow. We used to take our kids here years ago..., but I don't think we will return"
3,"While on a trip we were directed to this restaurant.  I will say in advance that I cannot handle really spicy foods, but my husband can. Hard to find a Mexican restaurant that we can agree on. \nWe were seated inside since the patio was not open. I hope to time it differently next time, the patio looked like a fun place to be. \nOur meal was great and the server very patient with us. Great suggestions. \nI was so excited about the green cream sauce that was on my meal. It was surprising that they put the recipe on their website. How great of them. I have made it twice since we returned home....I don't have it down pat, but still really good.\nI look forward to returning again."
0,"You don't even deserve a star! Two appointments in a week, over 30 minutes late the first time with a 4 hour window with No call and No apology for being late! Today another 4 hour window today and NO SHOW, NO CALL!!!\nI do NOT recommend this company!!!! If you have an account here I'd cancel it!!!!! Disgusted, now I have to take yet another day to be here to get my washing machine fixed!!!!"
3,"We came here after a fun night downtown with friends. We wandered in and decided we wanted to get our hands on the the infamous $5.99 Prime Rib dinner.\n\nThe cafe is pretty clean and modern. Much nicer than I would expect from this place. We sat down and were immediately greeted by our server for our drink order. Service was fast and friendly and I was very impressed by the place at first glance. We were about to order the Prime Rib dinner but then the Steak and eggs caught all of our eyes and we decided to go with that instead. It was about 10:40pm, this matters because the Steak and Eggs aren't available until 11. Our server told us he'd take care of us and not make us wait until 11, awesome.\n\nThe food was pretty good and it was cooked exactly to order. Our server was attentive with refills and getting us everything we needed to enjoy our meals. \n\nA meal for four for under $25, can't beat that. Definitely a better than expected experience here! I'll be back for sure!"
3,clean and friendly staff.  Great prices before 11am and Mon-Thurs before 6pm its $5
3,"The pretzels are awesome..... I went with a group of girls our service was great she was able to split our checks for us even though she didn't seem very excited about it. Service was great,  drinks were great and most of the food was great 1 girl complained about the kale salad she said it wasn't her favorite but it was ok. No other complaints"
3,"Dragon and Las Vegas rolls are pretty good. I am not much of a sushi fan, so I think that says a lot. Sake bombing there is fun and the atmosphere is good for anyone who doesn't mind college adults. Service was pretty good and tried to be very accommodating even though we didn't order much."
2,"I really like going to BJs when I am in town visiting my family. They have a HUGE menu so everyone can get exactly what they want. But much like the Cheesecake Factory, everything on the menu is not great. In my opinion, the pizzas and pasta dishes leave much to be desired. The sandwiches, soups, burgers, salads, and appetizers are very yummy. My favorite is the clam chowder in a bread bowl. So. Good.\n\nThis appears to be a great place for groups.The staff is very accommodating, and attentive, and the restaurant is very big. Friday and Saturday nights are generally packed with people, understandably so with the good food, relaxed atmosphere, and the beer/drink menu. If possible, I would call ahead or be prepared for wait a bit.\n\nAs I mentioned before, this place has an extensive beer and alcohol menu. My dad and uncle love this place for the beers, and I love this place for the cocktails. I have not been for happy hour, but I hear it is great. \n\nDefinitely A-OK place for lunch/dinner in Chandler. I think as far as places go in the area, this is top notch."
4,"Here on business, staying at the downtown sheraton across the street from the restaurant. I've been here twice this week and the food and service have been great. Chips and salsa are a unique blend of sweet and salty and delicious. Great margaritas. Both I can only comment on the fajitas but they are amazing. I'd definitely recommend"
0,"We went to this location on a Friday night because it was close and unlike all of the other restaurants in the area, the parking lot wasn't full and there was no wait. The hostess (there were three of them),asked if a table was ok and I told her we preferred a booth. She gave me a look of disgust as she set off to find if one was available. There were MANY. She seated us and that was the last we saw of an employee. Well, many passed by our booth, but all chose to ignore us. We talked for a bit before I realized that no one had stopped by our table to even offer drinks. I asked my partner how long had we been there and he said 10 minutes and he was wondering if I had noticed. At that time we decided to leave. We took the menus back to the three hostesses that were still there talking. I told them that it was a shame that no one had stopped by our table in 10 minutes. They just looked at us and I heard them giggle as we walked out of the door. This wasn't my first negative experience here, but it was definitely my last."
3,This is the best pizza I have eaten in Vegas and one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten (the best pizza I have eaten is in downtown Disney). I gave them 4 stars because their service is incredibly slow but in my experience man of the restaurants in Vegas have slow service. Definitely worth a try and I may be going back for seconds before I head home.
3,Great Mexican food for the price. Esteban is a very courteous waiter. The gringo dip is a frat choice for an appetizer.
1,"Not a total sit down restaurant, not fast food either. Order at the counter, and have the amazingly friendly staff bring it to your table.\n\nFor some Greek-American food it's not bad. By no means fancy, but it tastes pretty good. I would say it's a step above a burger joint, for some simple,  inexpensive food, come here and enjoy."
2,"My Big Fat Cell Phone...\n\nYou're probably asking me what does this mean? Well I went to this place and forgot my big fat Nextel Cell phone on the table, as soon as I realize it, I rush back (10 minutes later max) and the cell phone is no where to be found. I asked the waitress, the hostess, but no one had turned it in. I tried to call it, and it was shut off. What happened you say! The Bus Boy took it! Yes, the damn busboy, stole my big fat cell phone. Ironically I'm glad he did, because I hated that phone and wanted to get a new one, but had no good excuse to buy a phone at that time. \n\nFood wise, this place is pretty good, and inexpensive. If you like Greek food of course. I consider this the Applebee's of Mediterranean food,  so don't expect to be wow'd with uniqueness, expect consistency and a decent experience. It is grab a  quick lunch here and just relax kind of place. \n\nThis place deserves a 2, but since it was a catalyst to me getting a new cell phone I bumped it up a notch. So all of you people looking to get rid of old technology, bring it t MBFGR, and leave it on your table, the bus boy, just may take it!\n\n(evil laugh)"
2,I love beer. 3 stars for that. It is a bar after all.\n\nAs one of the first places I visited when I moved to Pittsburgh I remember coming out of the bathroom and seeing a family of four with two young kids in the bar and nearly passing out. What is the deal in PA with being able to bring your kid to the bar. Now I have a kid and we regularly make it out for a pint.
4,"Oh yeah son!! Love this buffet!! \n\nEvery time I'm in Vegas I make sure to drop by. I'm not going to lie, you're going to drop about $35/person for this buffet, but you will leave satisfied. \n\nThey have a large assortment of breakfast items, Chinese, seafood, Mexican, pho, sushi, and dessert. You also get mimosas at no extra charge. They also have a bar where you can get custom drinks, which you have to pay extra for. \n\nI've tried the buffet at Bellagio and this buffet is hands down better than the Bellagio buffet. \n\nBEWARE! There are 2 buffets at the Rio, so make sure you go to Carnival World Buffet. \n\nHappy Grubbing! :D"
2,"With as many people who pass through Vegas, it would be nice if the airport solicited additional vendors for food.  This airport lacks better dining options and with mandatory 2 hour prior to departure airport check in's, there is a lot of time to kill while waiting for the departure of your flight.  Otherwise, it's OK."
0,"I have to give a star but if I could, I would have given no star. Customer service at the check in window at the Las Vegas airport was not at its best. An older woman named Karen is one who is not very friendly and made our experience awful. She didn't greet us warmly but instead called us by saying next. No smile. Gave us a lecture about what we should have when traveling and went on rambling about it until we left her window. We were also trying to help speed up process by putting our luggages down for her but she insisted on us putting heavier luggage down first after already putting down a luggage for her (how can she tell which is heavier if the luggages are the same size?) She made us take luggage off to put the other luggage on. I've never had to do that with other airlines. Other airlines weigh the luggages in the order you take them off luggage cart. It would have been nice if she had engaged in small talk and to wish us a fun trip but instead we had to experience poor customer service and left her window dissapointed and upset.  There was a woman behind Karen, helping her carry luggage behind the counter, it would have been nice to be greeted from her instead of giving us hard looks. I hope the service gets better for that location, because they represent Southwest."
1,"Pluses:  Service, priced well for what they are attempting (attempting being the key word) clean, fun atmosphere.\n\nMinuses: I had the burger with A1.  It was smothered in A1 overpowering.  Made the bun super soggy.  Burgers are well done,  no other option.  Only American cheese no other cheese choice.  Really?  Fries were unevenly cooked.  Some were still white others crispy-very inconsistent."
0,Asked nicely a question. Literally. \nAnd the manager in charge was a bitch. \nI was asking about the Star Wars exclusive really nice.  And she flat out said no. Not all walgreens carry it. \n:( imagine in a rude voice \nWhite hair older lady in a manager vest.
2,"We were driving around wasting time and came up on the restaurant.  We were in need of breakfast, so IHOP it is.  The parking lot is really weird- the way the spaces are lined up, it can be difficult to park.  There is also not alot of space.  The nearby area seemed a little sketch, but not frightening.\n\nI ordered the pick-a-pancake combo.  Didn't really need the hash browns, but my brother offered to eat them.  Problem solved.  I got the double blueberry pancakes- blueberry pancakes with blueberry topping.  You definitely get alot of them. The eggs were cooked well.  The bacon could have been cooked a little longer.  To drink, I got the splashberry splasher.  How awesome that you get free refills of them.\n\nOur server was a bit slow to begin with.  We got seated, she took our drink order, and then she disappear for a long while.  The others in our section were looking around for her, too.  My brother even joked with another table that they may have to go find her.  Not so good."
4,I went for my bday dinner and it was delicious!!  I had the Prime Rib with bone and creamed spinach. My boyfriend had prime rib with lump crab. Both our meals we cooked prefect and flavorful. I would recommend this place to everyone. The service was excellent!
3,"One of the few good, non-chain food options in Champaign, IL. Their cheese curds are to die for and their white sangria is delicious. On busy weekend (Mom's + Dad's weekends, Graduation, Holidays, etc.) reservations are a MUST!\n\nThey also sell growlers of their beer!"
1,"I wanted to preface my statement with something positive. I love Vietnamese culture, family values & yes, the food!\nI've frequented this particular Vietnamese restaurant several times & noticed even with a nice tip for good service it still felt \""cold\"".\nToday's visit we ordered as usual. My partner needed additional rice. She was ignored by two different staff members?! I can understand if it's not your particular function. If not, let someone else be aware. Finally, we asked a third person & he fulfilled the order of rice. Today was noisier then usual with the busboy organizing & preparing utensils. Later, I asked my partner, (she is Vietnamese ) why the cold reception from the male employees. She says it's normal for Vietnamese men to harbor contempt & general disregard for woman who date outside of their race. Really.  pfft"
1,Food is not great. I got the marinated pork over rice. Would not go back.
4,I'm gonna start off first that I haven't been here for the teppanyaki yet. I usually come for happy hour which is amazing. I mean you can get three rolls and an appetizer which would be good for two ppl for under 15$. Plus if you come on a Tuesday they have 1$ sake and they r actually pretty good I would recommend the cucumber one. The service is always good and the place has a nice vibe.
4,Love the studio and the family feeling of everyone there.  My daughter started ballett the first of the year and is having such a great time.  Thank you Regina and Jason for this wonderful studio.  Keep doing what you are doing!
0,"This location is in Green Valley just off the 215 freeway.\n\nTOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me, it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY!\n\nHuge food portions, blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice.\n\nLack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service.\nNeither was delivered on this visit.\n\nI may or may not go there again"
3,"My first time at Razz last night with a group of 25. They really brought their \""A\"" game to service us. I'm told that they are always busy...even on a Tuesday night. Hate going to a restaurant and it's 1/4 full. Scares me. This place was hoping and we added to it. \n\nThe space is done just about right...contemporary and not pretentious. We had plenty of choice on entree's (not the whole menu) and with 25 people in our group...I think I saw the bulk of the menu. I had the Bouillabaisse and guest to the right had the halibut and to the left had the short ribs. Immpressive portion was my first immpression on my dish and others as well. The broth was light, not chunky and heavy, perfect consistency as this is a soup and not a stew necessarily. Well, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well- flavors were subtle, no one flavor overpowered the soup, and the tomato base was light. I like a little more wine flavor coming through but was not disappointed. I wish I knew how to give a half star here because Razz is not at a 5 but it could get 4 stars here. \n\nOops....salad, very imaginative, and combined 8 or 9 ingredients and again, the portion was very immpressive. They have a long life in the restaurant business, get there and enjoy."
0,"A couple years ago, my BF treated me to a massage at Massage Envy, she had a coupon for a discount.  When we booked the appointment, I requested a female masseuse.  When we arrived, I was told I would have a male masseuse instead.  I take daily injections for a medical condition, and I happen to bruise very easily.  Prior to the massage, I had hit a vein and caused a dark bruise on my stomach.  I warned the masseuse about the bruise, but English was apparently not his first language.  When I flipped over, the masseuse saw the bruise and asked if my husband was abusive.  I then had to re-explain the bruise a couple of times before he understood.  Also, the masseuse was quite chatty which I don't care for at all.  Needless to say, this was not a relaxing massage at all, I would rate it as my all time worst massage."
1,"Not a huge fan, but my husband whats his burger with egg...YUCK!  Although now he doesn't eat meat, so he opted for the patty melt with the meat patty substitute....defeats the purpose of going their at all."
2,"This review is about a month overdue.  \n\nExperience:  Came with a group of folks to try something different.  Was looking forward to it, since I never had Peruvian food before. There was about 10 of us and we came at lunch time. \n\nService:  The staff was still setting up when we came in, but were very helpful when we needed anything. \n\nFood:  They put down some corn nut type munchies that have a nice spicy green sauce that I just loved. \nI had a Peruvian friend who told me to try the Papa A La Huancaina. It was good, but a little rich. It was almost like a hollandaise sauce over boiled potato slices. \nThen we had the Yuquitas Fritas, and they reminded me of potatoes...maybe just a bit bland with some good sauce to dip it in. \nMy main course was the Chicharrones.  It was roast pork with fried sweet potato slices and a hominy salad on the side.  I liked this dish, especially the pork. \n\nFacility:  The restaurant was a quaint little place that was kinda long and not wide. It sat our group fairly well.  It did have some Peruvian flair to the atmosphere with the decor. \n\nOverall:  this place was good, but not amazing.  I would come back with friends, but since it's out of the way, it will not be anytime soon."
3,"Still, one of the better happy hour joints in Summerlin. And you can eat somewhat healthy on this menu: Chicken Satay & a couple of sushi rolls. But for dinner is where you gotta get sum!!!!!"
3,"I am so glad that:\n\n1. Someone else bought this place\n\n2. That Italians bought this place\n\n3. That there are no reviews for the previous business bearing the same name with the former owners because it is a whole new restaurant.  It's like Gordon Ramsey came in here and cleaned the place up.\n\nSomebody has been paying attention to the current dining trends.  Most of the main room is wide open with hardwood and tile floors.  The few booths are high and comfortable.  The side room that used to house pool tables now serves as a private room or extra dining space if needed.  The bar is nice and modern and boasts 12 beers on tab, the local one being OMB Copper.  The menu isn't limited, but it focuses primarily on pastas and pizzas.  Do one thing and do it well.  These restaurants tend to be more successful.\n\nI had kept up with the old Carolina Bistro on Facebook and as such have been keeping up with the new CB.  I have also seen their ads in the Fort Mill Times which also had an interview with the owners.  Wednesdays is $8.95 pasta night which includes a decent amount of one of 8 pastas, plus a small salad and 2 garlic knots.  I got the baked ziti which was good.  I can't say it was outstanding because it tastes similar to what I make at home.  My wife got the linguine with broccoli and olive oil and that was good.  It even had fresh sliced pieces of garlic.  The garlic knots were delicious.  The salad was fresh, dark green lettuce.  I got their homemade balsamic and vinegar dressing which was good.\n\nOur service was polite, friendly, and prompt, despite being a little unusual at first.  There was some confusion as to who our waitress was, and the hostess was also doubling as a waitress.  Thankfully things improved after that.\n\nThe bottom line:  It's nice to have a home style Italian place near the house with reasonably priced fresh food and we will return.  Although the address is Fort Mill, it is technically in Indian Land on 521 about 1 mile south of Ballantyne."
1,"Food:  ok but too salty\nEnvironment : clean and open kitchen\nService: servers are nice but we have to constantly ask for things.  We have 6 people and was given 3 napkins and 4 spoons.  \nAlthough we have 6 and service was just ok, we were charged 18% gratuity.  Not happy about this. \nConclusion:  so many pho restaurants nearby. I definitely won't come back."
1,"Yuck, something has gone downhill here.  Tried it for the first time in a very long time again today, and it is not as good as it used to be."
0,"Very bad service. I took a tv in to be fixed last year and they still have it. I took it in for a high pitch sound,they fixed that part but when I got it home I could not get the over the air channels. I took it back to them in july of 2012 they still have it. Every time I call or go up there they tell me that they it will be ready in a couple of days. Do not us this business you will be sorry.  UPDATE: 4/3/2014. Talked to Gary last week he said they would call me the following Monday or Tuesday it never heard from him. Finally got it back. It did the same thing I took it in for not bad for having it all most 2 years."
2,"I'm only giving 3 stars for 2 reasons: mediocre service and a so-so presentation. The restaurant is located near UNLV, which probably explains why everything is only mediocre because it caters mostly to students. The food quality and the prices are great though. Palatability is questionable at first glance because of the presentation, as I mentioned earlier. They have good promos like 12 rolls for 5.99 usd... extremely cheap for good-tasting food."
3,"I've been to Cracker Barrel a few times before, and always enjoyed it. The food reminds me of stuff my mom, aunts, and grandmothers cook and the service is good.\n\nLast night I went with my girlfriend and our food came out really fast, which was great. But it was warm at best. My mashed potatoes were pretty much cold, with warm spots. My chicken n dumplings were mostly warm, with some cold spots. My fried apples were cold. The mac n cheese was slightly above room temperature. Her meat loaf sandwich was prepared different then usual, had no gravy, and the bread was soggy. We were both starving so we ate what was brought, and I had planned on just letting the manager know. I even took my leftovers in a box. I wasn't looking for any sort of discount or anything, since we had come in late on a Sunday night and the food tasted great besides the temperature.\n\nWhen I mentioned the issues to the manager, he immediately said they'd take care of our meal. I was shocked. I was actually offering to pay our bill, and he wouldn't let me.\n\nEveryone has off days, and the manager went above and beyond to correct an issue that I wasn't even really that concerned about. Last nights visit won't stop me from coming back."
2,"I love Fat Tuesday drink but I'm giving this location a 3 star review because the service was bad. Guy looked like he was miserable and made it clear he was annoyed. We didn't give him reason to be so his attitude was uncalled for. Other than that, our drinks were good and definitely got us feeling tipsy."
2,"First time at this restaurant.  Food was quite good and portions generous. Impressed that they had a good selection of Italian beer.  Wait staff fairly attentive, not very outgoing.  \nWould rate higher but the seating arrangement was curious, to say the least. Restaurant opens at 4; we called at 3:30 to make reservations.  Were initially told that nothing was available until after 8.  After talking with another hostess, we were told we could be seated on the patio.  We showed up at 4, and there were only two other parties seated.  Still we were seated on the patio, facing the sun. We were told we were lucky to get our reservations in when we did.  When we finished about an hour later, we still were the only party seated outside.  So initial impression is a mixed bag."
4,"The food is surprisingly fresh and very very tasty!!  I got the beet salad, couscous with mushroom and truffle vinaigrette, and quinoa with mint and kale. The best I have had. Flavors are absolutely fresh!  The turkey sandwich was delicious as well!  Definitely going back!  A must for healthy eaters and those that want great taste without the bad stuff!!"
1,"If I had just one word for this place, it's \""s-l-o-w\"".  The food is okay.  I was one of two customers, and I think the staff was overwhelmed.  \n\nI can wait for good food.  I can wait for good food if it's busy and there's a waiting list.  I can't wait for marginal food with horrible service.  \n\nThe baked goods (already made in the display) are decent and bring this one star shop up to a two star."
4,Once again I heart vape satisfies! I am super picky when it comes to flavors so they made me a custom flavor today with peach orange mango and menthol. AMAZING flavor! If you guys keep it or not save the formula for me please! It tastes like a tropical breeze. I have a feeling people will enjoy it.
4,"Talk about a supergroup!  Combining the savvy, charm, and celebrity of Stefano Faita (\""In the Kitchen With Stefano Faita,\"" Entre Cuisine et quincaillerie, etc.), and the good nature and prodigious talents of Michele Forgione (formerly of Venti), along with the backing and spiritual guidance of Elena Faita (of Quincaillerie Dante and \u00c9cole de Cuisine Mezza-Luna fame), Impasto was one of the most anticipated openings of 2013, and they got started with a bang.  I've only been twice, but both visits were seriously impressive, from their appetizers and antipasti (do not miss their charcuterie platter), to their pasta dishes (a specialty of the Faitas, and a course Forgione absolutely excels at), to their mains and desserts.  Highlights so far have included:  their pistachio mortadella & their mousse de foie de volaille on their charcuterie platter;  corzetti with pesto, new potatoes, and green beans & heaven-sent gnocchi with tomato sauce, among their primi piatti; and a buttery, beautiful, and bodacious Florentine bistecca (easily 2 inches thick), which was said to feed 4-6, but easily fed 7, among their secondi.  An instant favourite!  \n\nKeep your eyes peeled for the pizzeria they're on the verge of opening..."
3,"I've only ever had dessert crepes here but they were divine. Nutella, strawberries and ice cream for me please. mmmm. Their cappuccino was also quite tasty."
0,"Chose 1 star because I couldn't pick 0 stars. Worst service I've ever had... Food very mediocre, drinks too expensive, and very dead for a Saturday night dinner.  Wouldn't recommend to a friend."
1,CLOSED! - This pretty bad place finally folded!
4,I can't say enough great things about this place. Esteban is an amazing therapist. Spend the extra money and get an 80 min Therapie massage. His knowledge and skill is definitely worth the price. I also tried Jen and she is equally as talented. I was exhausted (in a good way) when I left just because she had released so many knots in my body. Sally is one of the sweetest people I've ever met and just as talented as her staff. I sent my girlfriend to her for a breast massage after her mastectomy and she felt so much better after. Do yourself a favor and make your appointment now!
0,"Do not make the mistake of charging to room, Pay with cash!!! I received a pedicure and manicure service I signed a receipt for 275.00 and when I checked out they charged 415.00 to my room. Total scam! At check out I tried disputing it woth them and they sent me up to the salon for them to produce the original and of course they can not produce the original. Do not waste your time or money!!!"
4,"Mama Said is a family owned local convenience store. \n\nIt feels like a lot of reviewers are angry about the name, to be honest I don't understand the fuss... the fruit they have outside sort of gives it away as being a grocer's - perhaps those reviewers who were incensed at having to cross the road to find out what it is are myopic. \n\nThe prices in Mama Said are, in keeping with the kind of shop it is, higher than supermarkets but no more so than in any other convenience store. It's not as cheap as ASDA, but it's on the doorstep. You don't go to Mama Said for your weekly shop, but you go for a treat or a pint of milk, it is absolutely ideal for its purpose.\n\nMama Said are also my neighbours, and, as a neighbourhood, you couldn't ask for a better one. They keep an eye out for everyone on the street and are a Cockburn Street institution. May they be here for long to come!"
1,"Something about The Old Spaghetti Factory that I love and then really don't like, not sure what exactly it is.  The pastas are just okay but other things on the menu are good.  The ambiance is fun and family feeling. \n\nMaybe it's because the food is just okay but I want it to be better because I want to like the place.  It's holds some nostalgic memories for me as well as the the quirky atmosphere that some would call old, but I like it. It  makes me enjoy actually being there, maybe not eating there though. \n\nThis is a pretty lame review actually.  What was the point of this?  Not sure."
3,"The Luxor Hotel is RIGHT on the strip, smack dab in the middle of everything you need to see. You have the option to stay in the Pyramid or Tower section. We stayed in the Pyramids and absolutely loved it! Such great deals can be found on the hotel's website for hotel/air fare/show bundles, so it pays to look there first.\n\nThe rooms are so pretty and the beds are so comfy. The shower was sexy, too -- if that's possible.\n\nAmenities/Boring notes: Guests are required to pay an $10.95 per room per night (subject to change) mandatory service charge. This fee includes daily newspaper delivery, daily bottled water delivery (two bottles daily), daily admission to Nurture Fitness Center (this does not include the use of spa facilities such as whirlpool, sauna, etc.), and unlimited local, toll free and domestic long distance phone calls. The service charge will be paid by guests upon check-out."
2,"This place is called T Roosevelts now. We were there on a Sunday afternoon and were the only people in there. Not a good sign. We got a coupon for a free appetizer and got the spinich dip. It was typical. We had a corned beef slider...good but a tad salty. Then we shared the prime rib dip. It was so good with gardinera on it! Hand cut fries were good, too. We decided on banana crepes for dessert. Yuck!! The \""bananas\"" were actually plantains with no flavor. The crepes were super thick, almost pancake-like. They ran out of tomato juice, no bloody mary,  so my friend and I decided on sangria. The 1st one was good but 2nd was tooooo sweet. The server was fine, although he never told us his name. Also, the kitchen was open so you could see the cook on his phone the whole time he made our lunch. Very unprofessional in my opinion."
4,"This was a great restaurant! My husband and I were a little hesitant to eat here because we are really picky about our Mexican food, but I am glad that we did! The service was good and the food came out fast. We were only looking for a late night snack. I got the steak nachos, and they were excellent. They had a lot of cheese, beans, and good quality steak on them. My husband had their chicken tortilla soup and he loved it, I tasted it and it was really good a flavorful. Their prices were really good for what you get. I would definitely recommend going here if you are in the mood for good Mexican food."
1,"Very solid ambiance with a causal chic vibe to it.  Drinks were solid to decent in range but the service was subpar.  Our server couldn't explain 2 drinks that were on the special menu, for lack of a better word.  \n\nI'd expect that all server's when working should know what their special drink items are.  On this specific menu I counted roughly 6-8 drinks.  Other than that....... our drinks got to us but the service was delayed for the amount of people present.  \n\nI believe it was more on our server than a reflection on this bar.  Again, nice bar but subpar service."
3,Very mixed reviews here.  I found Over Easy a great place for breakfast and enjoyed my visit with some friends.  \n\nThey have a very good menu selection and will cook just about anything you could possibly want for breakfast if it's not on their menu.  \n\nTheir veggie omelet and a side of fruit was excellent!  My friend had their Wolf Pack omelet and it was good but a bit heavy especially with their fried potatoes. The portions are huge and their prices are fair. \n\nThis is a great place for breakfast!
1,"Wasn't impressed in the least. Nothing fancy... Basic toppings like white onions, iceberg lettuce, and processed cheese. If I'm paying more than McDonalds prices, I want better than a slice of off brand processed cheese on my burger. Maybe even a choice of American, cheddar, or a white cheese. Also, when going out specifically for a burger, a milkshake would be great along side it. Its just hamburgers, cheeseburgers, hotdogs, sodas. If you order a regular burger/cheesebuger, be aware that it has 2 patties. A regular sized fry is enough for 2 people. The place is LOUD. It gets quite annoying lsitening to the employees yell out how many people just walked thru the door, as if we didnt see them. They also have a worker constantly yelling out how long its taking to dish out burgers from order to pick up time. I like the fact that they tell the cooks if they need to speed up or not, but it just gets ridiculous constantly hearing them yell at each other. The only things I enjoyed about Five Guys is the free peanuts, the cool soda machine with endless options, and the homemade tasting fries. All in all, I will stick to Smash Burger or Fatburger where there are more options, better topping, and more bang for my buck."
4,"10.14.10\n\nThis place is amazing!  If you can venture off the strip and try this place, please do so!\n\nKiki's Burger:\nTwo types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere, with garlic aioli on the side.  Um, are you hungry yet?"
0,this is a busy dirty walmart and you shoud stay away from it. shop at a target
2,"An ok place to workout. Some of the staff are pretty quick on their tongues and at times can be very ignorant. The place is always clean and for the most part, there are machines to workout with. But there is always that machine that's out of service and others that don't have the right screw or clamp (incomplete machines)... 3 stars on my scale..."
0,Not the place to go if you are a healthy eater.
1,"I went to Princess Nails after hearing good things about this establishment only to be let down. During my eyebrow wax the technician did a poor job by not listening to my requests, she did not soothe my just waxed skin with any type of cooling gel, and left wax and hair on my face after the wax."
3,"This is a great place. My first time today!! I had Sicilian slice, not my norm, but it will be now!! Fresh and the sauce is awesome!! I found my new glue for Italian food!! Great job..I will be back for the cheese ravioli and Spaghetti/ meat sauce!!! Yummy!!!"
1,"Margherita pizza was okay, nothing special. Service was good. Overall your normal cafe experience in Vegas. I wish the caf\u00e9s were better."
2,"Finally tried it. Its a bit on the pricey side and they try their hardest to slow you down so you don't eat that much and up sell all the expensive appetizers and fancy drinks. They bring you these little dinky bowls to put your stuff in, which when cooked will amount to about 1/2 chinese food take out container. Have to get the all you can eat, or you'll starve to death from lack of food. They have way too many employees working at one time, they could get rid of about half of them and still run the place efficiently and maybe drop the bowl a buck or two, however the waitress we had was friendly, informative & helpful. The format is awkward at best compared to all the rest of the Mongolian BBQ's I have been to across the nation as they try to make this a restaurant experience & show instead of a Mongolian BBQ. It gets extremely crowded during the dinner hours and extremely loud, so crowded your practically bumping elbows with the party next to you. When you get up 3 tables have got to slide out of your way so you can squeeze through the little 4 inches in between tables (little over done, but you get the point). Kinda curious why they put on a \""fire show\"" when they want you to sit down after giving them your bowl, you cant see it due to the booths and the yelling and gonging is kinda annoying.\n\nIf your tall like me, expect a workout to get anything under the sneeze guards. This place must of been designed by midgets (no offense to midget architects). The meats are average and they have a fair selection of veggies, but the sauces are either too sugary or too salty and unusually thick (like molasses) and its hard to fine tune to taste especially for heat. Don't listen to them when they say their sauces are hot. I dumped a ton of their real hot one (Khanzu Sauce) and it barely spiced it at all, and their powdered spices don't do much either.  But all said, I can make a fairly tasty bowl and that's why we came. Roommate really liked the Curry Peanut Sauce.\n\nIf I was on this side of town, and wanting Mongolian \""style\"" BBQ, I would visit again. I figure I'll get the sauces down eventually, but it is definitely not worth a special trip or traveling from afar like from the Strip or Summerlin.\n\nWell see if this place survives (which I doubt), its WAY too expensive for what you get."
3,Food is great.
0,"Given the 100% positive ratings on Urban Spoon, I was really looking forward to getting take out from Lupitas.  I walked in and it seemed like it had a lot of potential. So I ordered everything on the menu.... all THREE things!... Carnitas, shredded beef, and chicken. I also ordered some salsa and tortillas.  When I got home and opened the boxes I was disappointed to find that they were boxes of meat and nothing else.  I mean, No sides of any kind.  No rice.  No beans.  No veggies.  It's a good thing that I had ordered the tortillas or I wouldn't have even had anything to put the meat in. \n\nThis wouldn't have been a big deal if I hadn't woken up a handful of hours, violently ill from what I had eaten.  Being up all night with intense cramping from bad food is not an experience that I care to repeat.  I won't be back."
2,I have always liked this place.  The food has been good in the past but has seemed to decline in quality.  Today may burger was ok where in the past it has been great. One order of wings was not cooked through.  The food was just ok this time very disappointed.   They have a great selection of beer and the OC ice tea is really good.  I hope they will get their stuff together.   I hope to return again but will wait a while.
2,"Attended CES 2012\n\nWhat a massive complex this is! Make sure you have a gameplan for the day. Food was very expensive, and parking was somewhat hard to find as a Vegas local. The monorail goes here but.... who rides the monorail?\n\nI'm not sure what could be done to improve this center other than a multi multi million renovation, which with the economy the way it is aint happening.  I agree with a few of the other reviews that this place is just bland. Nothing really \""Vegas\"" about this center.3 stars. FYI CES was amazing and I will be returning next year, but maybe I'll take a brown bag lunch."
1,"The owner is always yelling at the staff with a northern attitude, from the grill. Also, I echo the review about the staff, I can only assume based on poor social skills, they're hiring cheap labor. Also, they're cutting corners by using cheap iceberg lettuce rather then romain lettuce as demonstrated on their corporate website.  This is probably my 6th visit since they opened, they're consistently mediocre, I can simply say I'm not hungry after eating here. I guess I keep coming back thinking it'll be like pita pit on college st. in uptown..."
2,"I came here on a Sunday morning and the line was out the door. I looked over at Sam Woos, and the placed looked like it was closed even though the open sign was lit up. So I decided the food is probably going to be better over here judging by the crowd. \n\nI went up the front, and waited about 5 minutes and never got acknowledged. I was just trying to get a number to get seated. A Chinese couple came up and spoke in cantonese and they were given seating numbers immediately. So I decided to interrupt and ask for a number as well. The asian lady gave me a dirty look, and the Chinese couple were nice enough to say that I was ahead of them and I deserve a number ahead of them. The asian lady refused and still gave me the later number. As I was walking away I heard .. \"" he jus stan der like a wood, no say nuthin so no numba!\""   \n\nHmm so I guess customer service is not exactly their forte here. Since its my last meal in Vegas, and I have been meaning to try some great off the strip Dim Sum, I just had to deal with it. \n\nI was finally seated about 20 minutes later. The dim sum came at us hot and heavy. I was able to get all of my orange county favorites. The taste however was just as not as good as Seafood paradise in Little Saigon, but I would say its better then Cathays in Vegas.  The price of the food is definitely very reasonable. However the tip they earned was not so much. I expect at least to be acknowledged when I want to pay for service next time. \n\nI have dined at Sam Woos and Shang Hais in the same shopping center, but as far as Chinese food goes, this is the most authentic out of them all. I would come here for the food, get abused a little bit then leave with a full stomach and a stink eye at everyone you see in this place."
4,"Wonderful place!  Professional, good communication, fixed the problem right away and didn't charge me when I returned back months later for additional help.  I would not have known what this place was, as the sign isn't clear from the street.  I just walked in out one day and asked, \""hey what do you guys do?\"" Days later, I took my laptop in for some simple uploads etc.  They were the first people who were able to do what needed to be done quickly and didn't charge me a lot of money. The location can't be beat!  I can get my laundry, tan and groceries all in the same place! It was also drama free unlike going to the dreaded Geek Squad!  Hope they stick around for a long, long time!  I would also sugest they branch out Los Angeles, CA would be a GREAT place for them!"
2,"When everything else is closed, this is the go to place at the Wynn."
0,"Fees for \""dormant\"" account stripped me of $20 over the course of a year and a half. Be warned. And be warned that tellers have no interest in helping. The gentleman there in the back office was nice and informative and that is about where the good service ends."
3,"I was pretty excited to go to Lure, it was on my to do list for our trip in June but we didn't make it.  Just like Tryst, it did not disappoint.  There are two main parts and an outside area.  Inside the plush couches and tables surround the perimeter of the room while there are areas to dance in the middle and a loooong bar against the wall.  The bartender was fast and made strong drinks, the cocktail waitresses have the cutest outfits and the music was fantastic.  Definitely a great place to go if you want to dance to straight up good hip hop.  There was no line when we went and no cover.  I don't think I would make a night out of Lure....maybe if it was a low-key evening.  It would be a good place to start off the night."
3,"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so very picky:\n\nI eat here every so often with my boyfriend, its family owned and pretty darn good. \n\nYou'll find it in a small, almost deserted plaza on the NE corner of Mckellips and Mesa Dr. I like it so much, I brought my family here this past saturday, they seemed kinda hesitant cause of the location and it not having the normal chain name (ihop, dennys, village inn)..but they loved it.. my brother is pretty picky about his biscuits and gravy, but he approved.. weirdo. \n\nThe usual older man at the front is the owner I think. He is very nice and very welcoming...but the older lady that serves is kinda questionable? maybe i just come on one of her stressed out days? She serves the tables in The Duke room, anyway she warms up towards the end, maybe cause she knows the tip is coming. She forgot to bring our drinks that day, but remembered when she came out with the condiments... no big deal. \n\nFood prices are decent for the portion, but i noticed they did go up within the year.. still good though.\n\n oh and they serve breakfast up till 2pm, which is also the closing time."
4,The hotel was excellent. You are greeted when you leave and when you return. Check-in was effortless. The room was clean. Housekeeping come and clean the room twice daily. The front desk was always helpful. I would say this was the best 5 star hotel ever.
3,"With so many mexican and modern mexican restaurants in the valley, one wonders how a new addition to the fold can raise the bar.  I feel that Taberna does just that.  With chef Alex Padilla's modern spin on Mexican with central americal influences, food that is artfully prepared and plated, and flavors to entice and enhance, this is one destination for your tastebuds.\n\nThe cocktails and even non-alcoholic offerings are made fresh, and are a sweet way to begin the culinary fiesta.  The \""Sangria de Taberna\"" was excellent, served with fresh fruit and just the right combination of wine, brandy, and juice.  All margaritas are hand crafted and feature freshly squeezed juices - a must for a decent margarita.  They have a tremendous assortment of non alcholic offerings as well - fresh pressed juices combined with spring water and simple syrup.  We sampled pineapple, lemon, and watermelon - and each came with a juicy slice of fruit.  These were delicious!\n\nAs we were here during lunch hour, the menu had a smaller selection, but did not sacrifice on flavor.  In an unconvential move by me, I ordered the Fajita Burger.  This burger was highly recommended by the server, and I am so happy that I sampled this delectable \""Torta.\"" ( The spicy black beans with cortija were also an excellent side!)  A well seasoned and juicy skirt steak, with cheeses and peppers, doused in a garlic aoli, left beautiful memories in my mouth.  We also delighted in the Braised Chicken with Ranchera Sauce and Epazote Crema.  Chicken was also juicy and flavorful, the sauce and crema a delicious complement to the chicken.\n\nLunch menu offerings were \""Taberna Tacos,\"" street style tacos with ingredients such as grilled fish or chicken and chorizo.  Enchiladas and grilled sandwhiches were also on the menu.\n\nAverage price for an entree at luch is $12, but the fresh ingredients and flavors are worth the price.\n\nFrom the blue tortilla chips and plantains served with their flavorful salsas, to the flavorful entrees, this is a must try for Mexican food enthusiasts."
2,"Service was 2 stars, the guy did not want to be there. \n\nFood was 3.5 stars I had a Pollo Caprese which is a grilled chicken breast in a lemon butter type sauce served with thin noodles and cherry tomato sauce. It also had 4 small bites of cheese which I suppose was homemade mozzarella? \n\nWhile it was all good, it was just boring. Nothing stood out and said \""Hey you really like this\"" \n\nJust average food. Now I remember why it has been years since we have been there."
1,"Waited FOREVER for our food; pizza was alright, pasta wasn't fully cooked and the meat and marinara sauce tasted store-bought at best. Atmosphere was non-existent. Bathroom was hot and NASTY. Waitress was nice."
3,"The food here is a little pricy but not steep enough that you should shy away from some amazing flavors. We stopped by this place while we were checking out the new city center and walked out very happy with the $160 something we spent for two people for 4 to 5 tapas like entrees, one main dish that we shared and two drinks.  You can easily get away with spending less if you just split an order of paella for two but the wife and I wanted to get a good sampling.  The seafood soup deconstruction and creamy risotto is a must.  So is the ahi tempura.  The ham that they dubbed the best ham in the world at $28 an order is easily bested by costco prusciutto, avoid avoid avoid.  The red sangria deeeelicious and strong.  The white sangria not so much."
4,"This place was very good, its always hard to find a good Vietnamese restraunt that has a decent amount of dishes on the menu. We went in around 2:30 and there was no one there so we were served very quickly, and the gentleman waiting on us was very patient with my mother and all her questions and indecisiveness (Is that even a word?). The pho was a good size and there were plenty of vegetables on the side. I loved how they give a nice amount of cilantro in the broth too. The chicken curry was also very good. The next time I visit Phoenix I will definitely come back."
0,"Stayed two nights for a hockey tournament. Place was clean. Rooms were fine. Hotel ran out of towels so that was a bummer. Bathroom was small. Elevators were slow. Parking was tight. Pool is murky, slide broke.The neighborhood is industrial, no place to eat except a terrible steak house across the highway. The worst thing was the heat- couldn't turn it down (all the rooms are this way) so you sweat on top if the blankets. Can't stay in the room long. We checked out early."
3,"Where is everyone? Srsly Middleton! Show up. Represent! \n\nAfter an exhausting... er I mean underwhelming trip to World Market Tom, Ryan and I decided it was time to make the drive west worth it. Tom had been craving Korean for some time and because I don't make decisions I was game. The interior is pretty fancy pants for a small strip off the beaten path. Nice booths, tasteful artwork, cool color palate. But the paper napkins? That's like going to L'Etoile and eating dinner with a spork.\n\nHere's the thing though, I'd eat K Peppers with a spork, with a spatula or with my own bare hands, heck I'd eat K Peppers with YOUR bare hands... it's that good. We started with Topokki, Korean rice cake and a boiled egg cooked in a sweet and spicy sauce. We all thought 2 stars (spicy) was pretty darn spicy, but the sweetness balanced it out. From there, I moved on to Bulgogi which was unbulgogievable (wah wah). Tender meat, sweet soy, some veg for good measure... it was bomb, more than I could polish off after the app, but great for breakfast. \n\nA little bummed that we were the first table there at ten after six, and the only table dining for the hour-ish we stayed. But maybe people just don't know K Pepper's brilliance just yet. \n\nGet to know."
2,"Quick Tips:\n\n1. This show is located in the Planet Hollywood Casino Miracle Mile Shops area. It's more towards the end where the parking lot is!\n\n2. Though there are a variety of show deals, including \""free\"" tickets, there are also some great deals you can get by just going to those last minute ticket booths or looking online.\n\n3. We bought two VIP tickets that cost us around $25 apiece.\n\n4. There is a \""pre-show\"" by Armando Vera, who I think is much better. However, you need to purchase VIP tickets to watch it.\n\n5. The comedy/magic portion of the show are split. There is a small section of magic by Nathan Burton, then a section of comedy by another guy who I can't remember, and then a table-top/card trick magic from Armando Vera, and then back to Nathan Burton to close out the show.\n\nThere are two things that I look for when I go out to a show: content and comfort. What I mean by comfort is how the seating is and how drink service is handled.\n\nAnyways, in terms of content, when you first enter into the theater, they force you to take a photo to make it seem like you are indeed part of the show. They use this photo while we are all waiting for others to be seated. Afterward, they lead you to a waiting area downstairs where there is a bar. After waiting for a set period of time, if you are a VIP ticket holder, you head upstairs to watch Armando Vera work his magic.\n\nArmando Vera is a really slick guy. Very funny, and if he was the headliner of this show, I would probably have given him 4 stars. The problem is Nathan Burton is the headliner and isn't a magician, he's more of an illusionist, which is a different matter that I'll get to. Anyways, Armando Vera or (AV with his fingers as he will tell you multiple times) is a magician that deals with card tricks and other various smaller scale tricks. We found him to be very entertaining and pretty hilarious. There were a few tricks that were simple, but one or two that were a little more dazzling.\n\nAfter the pre-show we headed to our designated area for the tickets. The show starts and Nathan Burton comes out to do a few illusions that seem to the both of us to be pretty simple, but not bad. The illusions were sometimes easy to figure out. After Nathan warmed up the crowd, this hilarious comedian came out. I won't spoil it, but my girlfriend and I were in stitches. That guy gets at least four stars too.\n\nNathan Burton came out to close the show, and the illusions were not bad. More or less, there was A LOT of talking involved. I guess setting up for it was really difficult or something, but there was a few minutes of downtime. It was easy to figure out some of the \""bigger\"" illusions. Several times, I was like, this has to be a raised platform making xyz appear etc. For a headliner, I feel that the illusions are nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe one or two of them were wow inducing.\n\nAnyways on a note about comfort, I was disappointed in how terrible the \""VIP\"" seats felt. They were incredibly small seats and the guy next to me was over on my side for much of the time. Besides small seating, the drink service was pretty much a disaster. Because of the small seats and short rows, when the cocktail waitress came by to bring drinks, if she wasn't careful she would spill on some people's laps or on people's shirts. My girlfriend had the horrible misfortune of feeling someone's Long Island on the back of her head.\n\nAnyways, not a bad show at all! I would probably not go back, but it's worth it for first timers to see a little of that old Vegas magic."
4,"One of the best indian food Ive had. Even better, its all you can eat. The garlic naan is delish! Every item in the buffet line was delish and fresh! Only Indian restaurant I visit in AZ."
3,"Ok, this rating is for the bar and not the restaurant - and we also had no rum. But if you like to chill out, watch people, be they other patrons or the dancers on the overhead walkways, this place isn't all that bad. Drinks were decent, too."
0,"As I went to write this, I read cold meat in another review, andl they were not kidding.  My entire meal was cold to the point where I will be calling the health department as it is not safe to keep meat at this temperature.  The brisket had more fat than meat and the hot link was so old there was no moisture in it at all. The yeast rolls may have seen an oven a day or to ago and looked like they were par baked.  Only someone forgot to finish baking them, also stone cold.  $40 down the drain and NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN!"
1,"In the worst economy I've seen in Arizona in 30 years, Biltmore Fashion Park has just decided to institute PAID parking at its shopping center. This is insulting to the locals who consider BFP their neighborhood mall and shop here frequently. And it favors the ultra wealthy...a valet actually told me it's his job to \""protect the patron's luxury vehicles.\"" When I asked him if my $35,000 car met his definition of luxury, he gave me a blank look. Ridiculous. The ever-widening gap between the classes isn't being helped by policies like this. Hey, BFP management...remember the French Revolution?"
4,"Went during restaurant went for the 1st time. Excellent service and food. Party of 6 and everyone enjoyed their selections. Some ordered off the QF menu and others ordered from the regular menu. The braised curry lamb shank, the kangaroo, filet and lamb chops were the items ordered. My lamb chips and the risotto were excellent. I tastes the kangaroo---a bit gamey for me but it was ok. The lamb shank was also very good. Desserts were good as well---chocolate torte, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and strawberry shortcake---all were great. Nice wine selection as well. Definitely a must try restaurant!"
2,"Great place for cheap, and variety. If only they could be open 24/7. Also it may be cheaper buying from a whole sale spot like Cosco, etc."
3,"First time in Vegas.. first restaurant that I went to.\n\nJust below Tao is Grand Lux Cafe. They're open pretty late if not, 24 hours. My friend took me here for late munchies after TAO. I've only had their Fettuccine Alfredo which was delicious.\n\nThe price is average. However, the service is not as good as you would expect it to be. I would assume it's because people usually come here at the wee hours and drunk. So, they don't need to provide excellent customer service.\n\nI possibly would dine here again, but I just end up at some buffet."
2,"Everything at the hotel was great until we experienced the service at the breakfast buffet. Both the terrace and the other breakfast location had one of the most horrible service I have ever experienced !! The waiters and waitresses were unequipped, rude and made us feel completely unwelcome. My cousin was having her wedding close to the hotel so we had a big party there. I thik it's a shame that such a wonderful place has such unwelcoming staff !!!"
0,Great improvements to the interior by new owners but what a disappointment when the food was served.  Cheap price but the quality shows why.  Egg drop soup had only broth and eggs.  Pupu platter was a varied of fried and over cooked meats...HORRIBLE!  Emperor chicken was so salty and mainly fried breading...where's the meat? We won't return even if it is cheep.  I'd rather eat at the Wendy's next door!
4,"We love Amano's! I'm not sure why I haven't written a review until now. The food is great! The pizzas are very good as are the pastas and meat dishes. Be sure to check out the specials menu. The service is excellent. It's always a pleasure to be waited on by Patrice- she is quick, knows the menu, and appears with crayons and coloring pages right when my kids need it. \n\nTry the antipasti platter. Try the AMAZING balsamic glazed strawberry dessert. \n\nTread carefully around the after-dinner carmels. Most of the time they are amazing (vanilla black balsamic: omg), but I will *never* get the flavor of the rosemary one out of my mouth. My advice: ask the flavor first."
3,"One of uptown Charlotte's newest venues, the Knight is a bright spot for the performing arts.  \n\nSeating almost 1,200 across three levels, the theater is spacious but has created a very intimate feeling between performer(s) and audience.  Having sat at all three levels, I can say there are pluses to each one and there is not an *awful* seat in the house.  In fact, due to the angle of the tiers and their rise between levels, you will literally feel very close to the performance at all times.  Acoustics and sound technology are all top notch and greatly enhance the performances I have seen so far.\n\nThe lobby spaces and VIP lounge are also well thought out and usually host a number of stations for libations and refreshments.  As a bonus, some performances even allow you to take your beverage into the show with you- something unheard of until more recent times.  As with other Blumenthal performing spaces, there are ushers aplenty to make sure you find your best doorway and correct seats.  One warning: if you are late you will likely wait till a natural break in the performance to get to your seats.  \n\nThe space feels very modern and welcoming throughout, and adds a touch of class to every performance.  Whether seeing the symphony or a modern folk duo, an evening at the Knight is always a classy event.  Being connected to the Bechtler museum and just across from the new Mint museum makes this space a great place to connect with the arts."
1,"Came here for a glass of wine w/ a co-worker after a long and stressful day at work. Good happy hour, terrible service!!! Easily in the Top 5 of the worst waiters I've ever encountered....if I could be guaranteed he would not be there, I would probably go back and give it a second chance.....if you are seated, and your waiter is an older gentleman with a Southern accent, get up and leave, trust me!!!"
0,"I had no choice, but to choose a star. Over the years this Mc Donalds continues to disappoint.  I truly believe this franchise owner really does not care. This morning will be last time I go there. The people at my job have had similar dissapointing experiences with the same place. It is close and convenient for us. But they would rather go to another location nearby or somewhere close to their home, when commuting to work. This morning I ordered strawberry cream pie and was told again that they had none and asked if can be I would like apple pies instead. About fifteen minutes later at work. The apple pie was hard as a rock. More like a apple biscuit. This is the final straw. This place is horrible. The list of things that I have ordered over time is too long to list. Mc Donald Corp should pull their licensing away from owner. I have took time from my day to write this, rather than spending it on something else more productive."
1,"Yelp has it right on the money as in it is a 3.5 stars, the food was excellent but the service sucked! \n\nI tried both the pork tamale and the pork chilli, while it was very good the service was just terrible. We never were offered salsa or anything of that nature. \n\nI will probably go back but will expect the terrible service. Service is the only reason they are getting a 2 star over a 4 star as their was a dirty table."
3,"**Extra coupons***... if you are going here on a shopping spree, checkout their website first for extra savings! maybe they have them at their customer service desk too. 3.5  actually. Plenty of parking, lots of cool stores, huge Harkins.\n\nKind of messy right now, IMAX was closed and they are remodeling the food court.\nAlso, I had not been here in a while and I didn't recognize any of the businesses in the food court... all the familiar names are gone."
4,"06/12/11 DINNER.\n\nHaving never been here before, last night I attended their PIG OUT, a 5-course presentation of food, buffet-style, created by the owner/chef and 3 fellow chefs from the LV area. The food was FANTASTIC, not even factoring in the VALUE the event turned out to be. I must come back just to try more pizza, but they should put that pappardelle and porchetta on the menu!"
3,"A small, unassuming salon tucked into a corner of a strip mall. The prices are great ($19 for pedi) and the service is really good. A great find!"
4,First time eating there tonight........ By far out of all the places for good comfort food I just had the best Country fried chicken I have ever had! 5 stars easily. I am absolutely going back!
2,"Nothing fancy, $17 for a cheese pizza that is average .  beer tap list is impressive.  Not sure I would come back for food.  No real complaints just overpriced and unimpressive. . . give it an eahhh!"
4,"Great place for the whole family! They have a little for everyone. Kids games and puzzles, family games classics, and a great selection of tabletop RPG and some easy to learn wargames. Staff is really nice, knowagable and helpful. The owners are always in and out to see what the customer wants and they are quick to respond them."
0,"The word dump doesnt cover it.\n\nThe place smelled of carpet deodorizer and lysol.  No fridge, broken knob on the thermostat, all night leaking shower.  Really?  $120?\n\nLower budget shouldn't mean run down - it was like a vagrant hotel.\n\nThere is no reason to stay in this place."
0,"Yuck\n\nPizza tasted ok til we found a hair..\n\nSay what? Yes a hair..\n\nLady presumably the owner refused to believe it was true and we had to pay for everything..\n\nAlso don't touch anything, it's all covered with some layer of goop.\nGross\n\nEat at your own risk"
1,"When in a bind, I go to Wal-mart.\nWhen my husband doesn't know... I go to wal-mart.\n\nParking here is terrible. Shopping carts are piled up and everywhere.\nPeople are screaming, letting their dogs out to pee.\n\nNow, going inside.\nEmployees walk out of store with cigarettes in their mouth.\nCustomers always have drama..\nAnd I always feel like I see someone who is on drugs,\nor I see parents that need to be reported to CPS.\n\nI'd rather watch an episode of Maury."
3,"Don't judge a book by its cover or a casino by it's outer wall. Because tucked away inside the Rainbow Club in the back of a dark, slightly smokey smelling casino is a restaurant with a seriously good and very reasonably priced menu. \n\n$6 Denver Omelets! And they are freakin huge!\n\nThe decor is changing as the restaurant is remodeling. The rest of the casino while kind of smelly has a great bar with lots of big screens and good bartenders, and they have a nice mix of various slots to chose from. On the down side the restrooms are...in need of a remodel to put it nicely. But Peppermill knows how to make great food, and if you are in Downtown Henderson you would doing yourself a big disservice to skip this place especially if you're hungry. Parking can kinda suck,  but the short walk is worth it, and the wait even on a Sunday morning for breakfast is not that long. \n\nThe Ortega Chile Omelet is another favorite I have to recommend. And the service...the wait staff knows their stuff. Some of the older wait staff can come across with an attitude at first, but if you treat them with respect you get the same and a smile at the end. The younger wait staff has ALWAYS provided service with a smile without fail. As I sit here writing this I'm already looking forward to this weekend and going out for breakfast with family and friends again at the Rainbow Club. \n\n4 Strong Stars, leaning towards 5..it's close. Rainbow is Peppermill owned and Peppermill treats people right or at least me and my family love the place. \n\n(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #28)"
4,Lilac is the BEST!!!!   She has been grooming our little man Biscuit for over 2 years now and I am so glad that I found her after she left Elite Grooming Boutique!   She does an AMAZING job on him and he just loves her and so do we!  Would never go anywhere else!
4,"What everyone else said....and more. Go...go often. Get the family and, go. Pull the kids off the sofa and out of a classroom, and go. You will remember why God gave us the ability to reason...to strategize a solution in an accelerated endorphin surge and survive through a full body/mind synergism. Oops, slipping to the dark side there...but, it's all true. Just read the signs plastered all over, designed to keep you safe.\n\nSo, go. \n\nBut bring your own food and water. Didn't care for Rivers Edge...they apparently  didn't get the survive and thrive themed memo/ mission statement. The beer is great, so stick to that and some nuts if you forget the snacks. \n\nLove ths place...will get a season pass next year...for all the reasons Yelped already; except the guy who was towed. That stinks. A bigger message interwoven in that survive to thrive theme...read the signs or you will go down, literally and figuratively."
1,Lousy service. Staff ignores customers and socializes among themselves. Food is slow and meh. No sign of a manager anywhere onsite. Better burgers elsewhere. Main problem here is lack of leadership and no management.
2,"I would've given this place a 5 but I didn't have a good experience with the owner! She was rude, sour attitude to customers and employees and not accommodating to customer needs. She did not greet us or ask if we need anything. I had a rush order and she could not guarantee that my order be ready when I wanted it PLUS she charged me 3x what I was originally quoted for the order. On the other hand, The sales associate, Trish, was very helpful and nice. Since it was my first time, she helped me a lot and gave me advice. She even apologized for the way the owner treated me. Its usually the boss apologizing for the employee but this was not the case. Trish was very professional!!!! I think the way the owners treat the customers is a reflection on their business. I don't think I would recommend this place nor visit the shop again.  Sad because I really wanted to take my friend here for her birthday. Guess ill have to take my business elsewhere."
3,"Great Thai offerings.  Get the Tottie spring rolls.  Four tasty rolls that you roll in fresh lettuce, cilantro and mint. Good to share for a couple.  Dinner after that will fill you up. Wonderful Asian decore and pretty decent, but not great service."
4,"My favourite shop! \nI love this place soooo much that \n1) the staff know me by name\n2) I have been asked if I work for MB as I know all the products. \n3) if you visited my house you will see their lovely things in every room.\n\nMy friends say that the Amber cocoon hand wash smells of being a my house! \n\nFor me smell is an emotional experience and I associate it with memories. This may sound over dramatic, but for example the firefly embers candle reminds me of Paris and the bergamot scent that wafted through our wee boutique hotel.  It carries me back there every time I light the candle, it is like Lindsay cat nip! \n\nThe newly refurbished emporium on George Street is light bright and spacious. I can't be on George street without going in to wash my hands in the platinum sinks.  \n\nI am on the mailing list so get invited to all their guest evenings like tonight with the launch of the new products in the Pink pepper pod range.  The shop closes to the public and guests get plied with cava and canopies whilst getting pampered with hand massages or facials.  The knowledgeable and delightfully attentive staff are so enthusiastic.  With the guest nights you also get a goodie bag of 2 or 3 little bottles of shower gel or body lotion.  The little bottles are perfect for over night trips or taking to the swimming.\n\nThis is not a ladies only place.  My husband Alan loves the gents range and whilst he's not exactly metrosexual he is happy to join me at the guest nights to be given beer, fed canopies, get a facial and buy luxurious shower products (that I also pinch!)\n\nMolton Brown is the best place to shop for presents for people who like their products & pampering or who are a night mare to get presents for.  Always beautifully wrapped and you get a free sample with any purchase\n\nSo get on their mailing list, get to their events and I will see you there!"
1,"A contrived, overpriced faux irish pub that's perfect for Vegas. The live music was ok though."
3,"While most pizzerias in Vegas are obsessed with pretending they're from New York, the best pizza is from Chicago--thick crust, fresh ingredients and tasty sauce.  So delicious and substantial that one slice makes a full meal.  \n\nRosati's has brought the genius of the Windy City pizza pie to Vegas and they've done a brilliant job.  Most delivery places in Vegas will bring you a pizza 1/2 a step above the frozen cardboard you find in the grocery aisle.  Don't wallow in pizza mediocrity.  Order a pie from Rosati's and learn what you've been missing."
0,"My girlfriend and I were walking over try to Plato's closet and she noticed a 3.xx Turkey sub poster on the door. We walk in and I'm debating what to get and my girlfriend recommends the special to me. All this time the older guy at the counter is standing right there... But he rings it up our order as 11.xx. I ask about this and in a voice of pure contempt he says \""if you'd read the sign properly...\""  Dude, I get that I missed the fine print but you don't have to be a complete jerk about it. Didn't eat, won't come again."
0,"Walmart as a chain is okay. his particular Walmart is horrible.  I have been here several times, and each time I have not been happy with the selection, the service or the attitude of the employees.  Go to the Walmart on Dobson and 8th street."
2,"While visiting Vegas, I dropped by this place based on the recommendations of fellow yelpers and found this place be \""ok\"". The Dim Sum was average as there was nothing unique about any of the dishes. The service was friendly but a bit slow to respond. The eniroment can be improve. The floor was clearly worn down and the back of the chairs were sticky. I might come back if I'm craving Dim Sum. I recommend one to come early."
3,"I've always wanted to try this restaurant after I made a trip to Singapore; I have to say, it's not exactly the same, but close enough.\n\nI ordered the char kway teow, which is very similar to beef with flat noodle, or chow fun.  My friend ordered the pineapple fried rice, which is a staple dish of the region.  Both had good portions and flavorful, but my favorite part was when I saw a stripped coconut bring brought out to the table in front of us as a drink.  I had to order it.\n\nSo I walked out of the restaurant carrying the whole coconut, sipping as if I was at some tropical island.  Only $3.  At most Thai places, you'll get Thai tea for $2.50, WITHOUT refills.\n\nThe service was great, too.  I was picking the green onions out of the dish (I like my food cooked with them, but not eating it), and the waitress said she'd remember to take it out next time I order it.  Will she really remember?  Doubt it, but we'll see- I'll come back another time."
4,"The food is delicious.  The ambience is casual and hip.  The service is warm, friendly and attentive.   The price is more than reasonable.   I would be a regular here if I could, and I'm not even vegetarian!!!  Alas, I live in Northern California, so I will just have to look forward to dining here again during my next visit to the Phoenix area."
4,"This place is great!\n\nThis was our second visit to Yama.  We're from L.A., and it has been years since I've found an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant that is this good overall.  So, on this trip to Vegas, I was looking forward to returning to Yama, and it was everything I had been looking for.  \n\nNote that I don't usually eat \""fusion\"" sushi, nor all-you-can-eat or pre-prepared sushi.  My preference is for \""purist\"" sushi, with no California Rolls or Spicy Tuna, no tempura in the rolls, and certainly no mayonnaise sauces.  I suppose I'm a bit of a sushi snob.  (Sushi in Tokyo spoiled me).  However, this place is a great mixture of quality, value, and unique rolls, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nYama is primarily fusion -- lots of americanized rolls, many including tempura or other cooked items, but plenty with fresh fish as well.  The rolls were great, but the sushi-style pieces were quite nice as well.  I sampled Saba (mackerel), eel, white tuna, albacore, and hamachi, and all were very fresh and excellent cuts.  My wife and I also sampled many rolls, and all were fantastic.  The \""palm job\"" ended up being my favorite \""fusion-style\"" roll (hand-roll of soft-shell crab with eel sauce and a few other goodies wrapped in soy paper).\n\nTo be clear, you're not going to come here looking for mind-blowing omakase, or purist single-piece japanese-style sushi like Echigo or Sasabune in West L.A.  That's not what this place is trying to accomplish, and you hopefully already know you're not going to find that style of sushi at AYCE.  However, Yama isn't what I would consider \""AYCE quality\"" sushi -- it is much better.\n\nLast year we ate at a table, and service was decent (very friendly, but they're very busy so the waitresses got to you as quickly as they could, but sometimes it took a little while).  This time we sat at the sushi bar, and had a fantastic time.  Sushi chef Pauw (I'm pretty sure that was the spelling) was lightening fast, whipped up fantastic cuts of fish and beautifully presented rolls, and had a great \""attitude\"" at his game -- a mixture of seriousness, pseudo-impatience, and \""so what'll you have next?\"" pressure.  But a few funny remarks back and forth, and he would crack an ear-to-ear grin.  Every few minutes he would raise his hands like an orchestral conductor, beckoning the diners to call our their orders.  I'll absolutely try and get seated at his portion of the bar on my next trip!  \n\nFive stars comes from freshness, flavor, excellent value, and speed of service at the sushi bar.  Even if you're a self-described sushi-snob like me, give it a try.  It has an off-strip \""neighborhood\"" atmosphere, and it just may surprise you."
4,Food is served fresh...very close to home made food. If you are looking for an Indian restaurant..this is the place open round the clock.
1,"Stopped by here on the way through the New York New York casino.  This spot is nestled in the shops along the New York City facade.  Their pastry case is situated so the product stands out and screams bright and shiny at you.  It looked like a good idea!\n\nWe each ordered one delicious looking morsel then took a seat in the crowded walkway to eat our snack.  \n\nThe problem is, these pastries (or at least the two different ones we ordered) are \""engineered\"" for their looks and longevity in the pastry case and not the flavor and texture of the product.  \n\nBoth the caramel mousse and the cheesecake had a thick sticky gelatin disk laid on top.  At first I thought it was plastic, and tried to peel it off.  It made the surface shiny and glimmering under the lights, but was a thick sticky gummy mess when trying to eat the thing.  \n\nOn top of the cheesecake too?  Sure enough this thick gelatin made to keep the thing glistening under the lights was put on top of the cheesecake too.  It changed the flavor and texture.   \n\nThe caramel mousse had APPLES inside of it.  I was sorely disappointed in it, as I could not understand apple pie filling in my caramel mousse.  (Pic)\n\nThe cheesecake tasted like standard freezer cheesecake to me, but add that rubbery disk on top and forget it.  Nasty. \n\nDon't be fooled by the glimmering lovely pastry case full of treats.  Keep walking!"
2,"Meh... I could easily find better food, a better happy hour, and better service within blocks of this place. It's not terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it to people either."
4,Not your average dog!   Takes hot dogs to the next level.  The best  potato salad I have ever eaten!
4,"I have been sad wishing the Soup or Salads were still open in our area. I was happy to find this place while out shopping.\n\nThe salad bar is stocked with fresh veggies and add ons. It's clean and inviting. The soup bar, bakery have a nice selection. It can get quite noisy, but I'm here for the food."
4,Just discovered FH recently while looking at their You Tube video about TX programing for a Blade 350QX.\n\nI wanted to purchase a UMX Pitts and they had the item in stock and also had a 5% off coupon active.\n\nThe on-line ordering was easy and the item arrived in California in about 3 days.\n\nI usually buy from a larger on-line e-tailer buy I think I'll be doing more business with FH as a result of this great experience.
1,"Is it just me or did the prices go up like crazy? They remodeled to make it look like the typical corporation of America. Ever since the buy-out they jacked up prices and got rid of good coupons (5 off 25). If you noticed too, clearance items are reduced to only 25% off, when it used to be 50% (you have to wait until the food looks like utter crap and inedible for it to be a good mark down now.) This store has become a profit micromanaged store and it sucks because I came here when it felt like more of a small business with good cheap produce. My few cents off \""coupons for me\"" don't help when you jacked up prices. If you want to be like whole foods and charge high prices why don't you sell quality produce or make them organic. I'm not buying products/foods for the same price as organic and get my body tainted by pesticides and red-40, yellow 20 and poop-50. I'll pass."
1,"Walking down St. Denis is an experience within itself.  You might get swept up in the romance that is Montreal and innocently assume that all restaurants on the street are going to be delicious and serve quality cuisine.  This is not always true.  Sure, the atmosphere helps, and the cafe diners on the front patio appear to be enjoying themselves.  But, once you taste the food being served, you may not be sold.\n\nThey serve fresh squeezed juice, so everyone at the table ordered it.  Not realizing that we just spent almost $20 on juice even before ordering food.  The fabulous looking bread and pastry counter is not filled with items made in house, but made elsewhere.  Instead I was served a decent croissant, but nothing worth mentioning.\n\nThe worst part of the meal were the buckwheat crepes.  We had buckwheat crepes a few days before at a different restaurant across the street and loved them.  So, we thought that experience could be continued at Brioche Lyonnaise.  We were mistaken.  The room temperature, floppy sponge crepes given to us were not fresh and had barely any fillings.  Nor were they served with a side of anything appetizing to try to make up for their mistakes.  The chicken inside of the chicken pesto crepe was cold and dry, and barely any cheese to soften the blow.   I simply could not eat the dish, and everyone else that the table felt the same about their dishes.  \n\nThe worst part is that the brunch for three people was $70 CAD.  It was a tragedy!"
4,Fruit Pico de gallo is bomb!  If  you are looking for a bomb fruit salad the fruit pico de Gayo is definitely the way to go they do it up right!
4,"The best way I can describe our visit with Margaritaville is genuine. Everyone, from the hostesses to our server to even the stiltwalker guy, were very genuinely happy to have us there, genuinely happy to be working there, and the food was genuinely great!\n\nWe came last night with the 10yr old to celebrate his first week of school and we had a great visit! Hubby and I shared the Cheeseburger in Paradise and it was AWESOME. The fries were crisp and well seasoned. The burger was perfectly cooked and delicious. Son had the fish tacos and they were amazing. The side dishes were even well thought out and delicious. I had a side salad with our meal and it was cold, fresh, crisp and not some pre-packaged slop on a plate. We also had a slice of cheesecake and a slice of key lime pie for dessert. Food was EXCELLENT.  I had the wildberry margarita and it was AWESOME. My hubby had a rum and coke and said it was perfectly balanced. \n\nOur server, Jimmy, was polite, friendly, and very professional. Our drinks were never empty and he was never intrusive. Our food was served at the right temps and never seemed to have sat around under heat lamps. I hate when that happens. \n\nThe stiltwalking balloon guy was just super. He was friendly, kind, and genuinely glad to have us visit his place. In fact, we remarked that he looked just like the Jolly Mon from Jimmy Buffett's childrens book of the same name and he thought that was awesome. :) He made the most amazing Spiderman balloon creature that we've ever seen. \n\nSon has been raving about this visit for the last 12 hours and made a point to tell me to be sure to YELP this place as soon as possible.\n\nit's not often that I can say that I look forward to my next visit at a restaurant, but I am truly and genuinely looking forward to our next visit to Margaritaville."
2,"It's about one star for service, five stars for food. So I guess that puts it right in the middle at a solid three. \n\nThe Market Street Cafe welcomes you in \""Denny's style\"" dining where a hostess seats you on vinyl or you can belly up to the counter. You pay at the cashier on your way out. \n\nLate-night dining alone, I chose the counter and took advantage of their after hours menu (which is heavily discounted). I don't remember specific prices just that they were very low. \n\nI'd always heard about the Hawaiian specialty, Oxtail soup. So I ordered a bowl of that and sat back to see what might come to me. I had visions of a HUGE ox head impaled on porcelain in the middle of my bowl. Perhaps still moving, even looking at me. \n\n\""Where you from?\"" Ollie the Ox would ask. \n\n\""Ummmm...Co-Co-Colorado,\"" I would answer nervously, looking around to see if anyone noticed me talking to an ox in the bowl. \n\n\""Hmpf,\"" he'd reply in a huff. \""Must be nice. I'm from Hawaii but they BUTCHERED me and send me to YOUR FREAKIN' BOWL! All for $5.99! You have penny???\""\n\nAt that, the ox would lunge across the counter at my throat, and...\n\nOkay so that didn't happen (see photo). Out came a harmless, sizable bowl of stew complete with tasty ox, vegetables, and other spices. It was very good and I'll be back to order another. It comes with a side of rice and fresh ginger, all in all a whole meal - not just a soup.  \n\nIt took a while to get my check so I could pay. Meanwhile, another guy got tired of sitting there waiting to order so he left in disgust. Only when I stood up as if I was going to leave did someone come over and present the check to me. \n\nOkay so what did I expect for a few bucks? Ruths Chris servers? No big deal really. Just be prepared.  It's all good and I recommend giving it a shot if you're ever near the California Hotel & Casino. \n\nJust watch out for that ox."
1,"Breakfast for almost $16 was definitely not worth it...I ordered the orange juice and the egg and cheese flatbread. The orange juice was pretty good, but for the price...I could of definitely gotten two cartons at a grocery store. The egg and cheese flatbread was hard as a rock on the edges. The egg tasted very odd to me and on top of that, if you don't like yolk make sure to get egg whites instead. \n\nOverall, the service here was ok. The lines went quickly, but waiting on the food was treacherous, a lot of the customers weren't happy because they came out with all of our orders; instead of, giving the items one by one to customers. (Especially during breakfast on the weekdays...people are in a rush). This was my first time, and I definitely won't be coming back...I would suggest to go to a buffet instead for the price."
2,"I feel like I dined in my Grammy's sewing room.  Everything from the decor to the borderline-gaudy-floral chairs gives off that antique and worn (in a nice way) feel.  This one's got character!\n\nThe menu is a fusion of Mediterranean and Italian offerings.  Want some baba ghanouj with your pizza?  Bowtie pasta with your falafel?  Tomato foccacia with chicken shawarma?  You can do it here.  We shared a combo appetizer that included falafels, hummus and pita, baba ghanouj, and grape leaves.  The food quality on this was rather ordinary.  \n\nMy strip steak was tender and juicy and the best part of the entree.  The au gratin potatoes and green beans were soaking in a pool of buttery grease and oil though.  Mmm mmm, not.  My dining buddy ordered \""Tina's pasta\"", which was a special of the night and delivered extra lemony flavors x 100.  Did someone accidentally put Pledge into the vegetable oil bottle? \n\nP.S.  Service was solid.\nP.P.S.  There's street parking outside, plus a lot at the side of the building."
1,"Clean and focused; that's what I love about this place. Especially at lunch, you want a good burger and just enough fries to reach the cusp of a carb coma. Additional bonus points for those quad-size ketchup packets!\n\nWhat has taken down my rating - and prompted this update - is that the quality has stepped down a bit over time. The wait is getting longer. Group orders virtually close down the restaurant. They don't take debit. Half the time, the bun is overbaked, resembling a softened stone.  The veggies are becoming inconsistent. You have to ask for their specialty sauces. \n\nSimply put, this is a 3-star burger with 2-star order requirements, and I can only give one rating. So I'm going with this one, but if you think more highly, I won't blame you. At times, it's one of the best burgers in Montreal. But for my $10+ lately I think I'd rather take a shot with Cheeburger."
4,"I came to India Oven the day before July 4th.  My intention was to see the quality and variety of food as a potential option to cater for my wedding in the near future.  Usually most buffets have 3-4 main dishes, but there were like almost 10 different dishes.  I wish I had a bigger plate or 2 stomaches!"
2,"The pizza is okay.. Nothing amazing or notable. \nI personally don't mind the breadsticks. I get it, their deep-fried & different from other places. If you leave them out for too long, they get gross & chewy. They're best fresh. Especially with their marinara.\nMy favorite thing to order is their fruti de mare. The seafood is cooked perfectly, & the linguine al dente.\nTheir wine is an awesome price too!\nThe Alfredo seemed to be a little flour tasting. Not very appetizing, but my boyfriend seems to order it every time he goes in. Maybe I just ordered it on a bad day.\nSmall restaurant which is typically always short staffed. Went in one night an hour before closing & it seemed like 5 other parties came in afterwards. We felt really bad for the waitress (who had told us that she had literally told one other waitress to go home early because they were slow prior to this crowd coming in). We cut her some slack, but like I said, they're practically always short staffed. Nice staff, but definitely short staffed. Haha"
3,"i've been here several times already, and i just can't seem to avoid this place every time i'm in vegas!\n\nsucks that even girls have to pay though :\\ unless you can weasel your way to join a table reservation, which my friends did lol. girls are usually $20, guys range from $30-50 in my experience. in the three times i've gone, it seems like friday night are most optimal to get guys in (since bouncers WILL turn you away if the ratio of guy-to-girl isn't at least 1-2). saturday nights are almost impossible to get guys in, unless you go early, get your hand stamped, and enter through the re-entry line later in the night (which is what we did also! ...damn guys).\n\nnice area, pretty big dance floor with table seatings kind of encasing the dance floor, so you get lots of quiet guys drinking their beers and watching girls get down on the dance floor. on super busy nights, it is near impossible to maneuver; once you lose your girl friends, i suggest making friends with the groups close by, because it it'll be awhile before you guys are united.\n\nyou better watch out on super busy nights too, because you can easily get groped all over. which i was a victim to :\\\n\n1 bar inside, 2 bars outside (xs is indoor/outdoor). the outdoor area definitely gives more personal space, and there are couches in the pool where people can sit and catch their breaths.... or take self portraits :). there's this center gazebo thing where there's another bar, but the pool acts as sort of a moat, so it gets superrr packed and cramped in there. \n\nthe bartenders COULD be a little bit nicer though :\\ i mean, i understand that everyone's drunk and they probably get one too many belligerent drunks coming at them, but there are the select few of us that are sincerely trying to be friendly towards them. price for drinks are about the same as any other club, mayyybe a couple bucks more per shot.\n\ni would probably choose xs over surrender (they're both in the same hotel; encore). i've never actually been to surrender, but the cover's higher and my friend tells me it's just like xs, but more of a lounge than a club. i don't really like paying to get into a place to sit, and pay for more drinks :\\ but maybe that's just me."
2,"I went there for brunch on Saturday with my dad and sister. Paid $33 for each of us. Food was okay, nothing to complain or brag about but did not feel especial. Environment and service  were nice though. Took off 1 star for price."
4,"Based on Yelp reviews, I decided on Piestewa Peak as my first hike in Arizona and absolutely loved it!  I was looking for cardio with a beautiful view and that is exactly what I got!\n\nI went solo on Easter Sunday and was pleased that quite a few fellow hikers joined me on my mission to take on the Summitt.  In my experience I found parking to be a breeze.  The people were all friendly and the people watching was hilarious.  \n\nBe sure to bring plenty of water since it really is a trek and if you can fit it, bring your camera-it is worth the extra effort!"
0,over priced for sure. Checked out at T.I - came here for bfast before the road and it was blah- my dad was raving about it as we waited but it was just eh....\n\ni ordered the Fresh Market Skillet- eh- it came with soggy hash browns and eggs that i could totally tell where powdered - kinda disappointing - wasnt salted.. i mean blah
4,"What a great experience it was with Dr. Battersby!! An incredibly nice and genuine doc! I thought they were extinct... Like the last one was spotted perhaps 50yrs ago. I would def recommend him! He is super professional, takes his time, LISTENS, and very knowledgable!"
3,This LA fitness is convenient and inexpensive. This particular location can get busy around 5:00 but its normally still possible to get a treadmill then anyhow. Yesterday I was next to a smelly guy but the clientele is pretty okay for the most part here.
4,"I wish this place was in LA because it's legit. Reminds me of Japan.\n\nPRO: great price, tons of variety\n\nCON: did not happen to me but friend said when she went there was a cockroach.\n\nIt was clean and grade A on the wall when I went... I dunno. you decide."
0,"I never expected much from this place, just a good, filling lunch with my husband.  We both - FOR HEALTH REASONS - do not eat red meat.  My husband has a long line of heart disease from drinking and red meat, so he doesn't eat red meat.  I do not eat it too to be healthy and to support him.  You'd be shocked at how many people make him feel like crap because he's a man who doesn't eat meat, regardless of the fact that his dad was on his death bed just last year from it until he was rushed a new heart.  \n\nAnyway, getting back on topic....\n\nI ordered the black bean burger and my husband ordered a different dish that was meatless as well.  This order was to go, as we had somewhere to be in an hour and a half.  When we got our food (the wait was fine) they read off the receipt, which I appreciated, while pointing at the boxes of food, then we left with our meal.\n\nWe got home (we don't live far) and started scarfing our food so we could leave in time.  After three bites of my meal I wondered to myself why it tasted so weird and why I felt nauseous.  I scraped off the sauce and took off the toppings to find they hid a meat patty.  Some people would be annoyed at this, but I haven't eaten meat for many years.  My body can't handle it.  So I was PISSED.  HOW the hell did they manage to put a meat burger in place of a black bean vegetarian burger?!\n\nI immediately got back in my car with the remainder of my meal and drove right back to this place.  I went up to the girl WHO TOOK MY ORDER INITIALLY and told her that she messed up and gave me a meat burger not a vegetarian burger.  She looked at my receipt and said, \""oh, I must have put it in as a black and blue burger instead of a black bean burger.\""  Did she apologize?  NO. She just looks at me and says, \""do you want to talk to a manager?\"" I said of course I did, shocked that she didn't even care enough to apologize.  \n\nThe manager came out and, after I explained to her what happened, she was very shaken and went to the kitchen to tell them about the screw up.  But she never talked to the girl who messed up my order.  The kitchen didn't know because she typed in the wrong order!  \n\nThe manager came back to me with TWO $5 off gift cards.  Not ONCE did anyone offer to refund me for my meal, or even just the burger that I obviously wasn't finishing.  I had to fight for the refund for a few minutes before they agreed to it.  I was sick to my stomach from the meat for a few hours after, but thankfully it never came back up.  \n\nThis place does NOT give two craps about you or your food coming out right.  I will never go back."
1,The sandwiches had a lot less greens and vegetables than I'm used to at Subways I've frequently eaten at in California. Also didn't have any avocado... Overall the sandwiches were of much poorer quality than I've come to expect from Subway.
0,I had an appt set and then I was called and the appt was cancelled due the owner having the flu. She was going to call to reschedule - that was a month ago and I called 3x's and left messages as well as emailed the business. No response to any on my efforts. I bough t two appts but can't get anything scheduled. I'm very disappointed and will be notifying Groupon for a refund for both. This is not a business I care to work with since there is no regard to the customer.
0,"A couple of friends and I decided to take a spur of the moment trip to Urbana to meet our parent campus and get to know the university. It was a sunday and we wanted to catch the NFL games so, naturally, we went up to a bar. Murphy's was our 3rd choice (after the other 2 bars were either closed or not showing any games). The place was empty (not surprising coming from a college town where all they care about is Saturday Football) except for a couple of old guys talking to themselves.\n\nThey had a lot of TVs and only one game on, when we asked them to switch it they couldn't because they didn't own the football package -strike one-\n\nDespite the place being deserted our server never took our order and we had to go up to the bar to have them take it. There is some controversy about this, as some bars will have you do that in the early evening but I've been to bars in the middle of nowhere at the same time where this wasn't the case. Either way, that was a bit annoying, so strike two.\n\nStrike three came along when after ordering we had to pick up our own food at the kitchen. At that point we gave up on good expectations and simply sat down to watch the game.\n\nThe good news is their food is amazing. My friend and I are no fans of fries either but man they were awesome! And their bean burger was gigantic and extremely good according to my friend, while I had the steak sandwich and that was absolutely perfect.\n\nIn any case, chances are the place is legit on Saturday Game Day, but it's up to you if you want to try it out."
4,This place deserves a 5 star rating. We came to try their AYCE and we were not disappointed. Everything was delish except for the Yakisoba. I thought I ordered a Soba style dish and it wasn't. But what do you expect? This is a SUSHI place for heaven's sake!!
2,Pot roast and biscuit were solid.  Collards and fried green tomatoes were disappointing.   Overall nice meal with southern diner type atmosphere.  Next time I will try the chicken and dumplings.
3,"While I didn't eat at the restaurant, I did pass by their take out dessert counter to pick up a little something before I crashed in my room after having drinks with some colleagues. I picked up a chocolate creme brulee and man was that thing ultra rich and full of choco-goodness. I actually picked up a brownie too, but after attempting to finish my creme brulee, I wound up only eating half of that (i felt guilty because i made a point of eating healthy during my whole trip....damnit), and saved my brownie (it was nicely wrapped with a ribbon and everything) for my boyfriend when he picked me up at the airport the next morning. he loved it, btw. \n\ni'll have to eat there next time, but probably late at night, since the menu looks so much more appealing after drinking."
3,"From my first visit in 2008 to many, many visits in the last five years, I have enjoyed EVERY meal and experience. Perfect for an intimate evening with your beau, a light lunch with your shopping partner, or a celebratory meal with a group.\n\nHaving dined here so often, there are few dishes I haven't tried. These are my favorite that are classics and, unfortunately, some items that have since been removed from the menu (seasonal, making room for new dishes):\nCALAMARI FRITTO MISTO: It's no surprise that I love calamari and it's one of my *benchmark* dishes to try at new restaurants. I like their batter, the lightly-battered peperoncini that creates a nice, refreshing note, and their delicious marinara for dipping. I do not like the creamy sauce (not really sure what it is) that is also served.\nLOBSTER BISQUE: This is definitely one of the best lobster bisques (or bisques in general) that I have eaten. Nice pieces of lobster and this version is finished with a touch of sherry. Delicious. BTW, the cup is enough; trust me, don't go for the bowl unless that is all you're planning to eat.\nPOLLO AL FORNO FLATBREAD: Grilled chicken, tomatoes, bacon, feta cheese, green onions with a tomato sauce and creamy parmesan. SERIOUS YUM. The bread is the perfect thickness, creating the right vehicle for this delicious medley of ingredients. Sadly, this is no longer on the Vegas menu!\nCHICKEN MILANESE: Romano breaded chicken with herb spaghetti served in my favorite sauce - pomodoro. The breading is crispy without overwhelming the dish and I love their interpretation of the pomodoro.\nCHICKEN LIMONE: PIccata-style chicken with a blend of lemon, capers, and white wine - another preparation I really enjoy. The chicken breast is always juicy and the sauce is tangy. They used to serve it with their cripsy potatoes (large chucks of well-fried/sauteed potatoes with herbs and peppers - think \""Potatoes O'Brien\""), which I really liked.\n\nThere are many salads, appetizers, pastas, flatbread, and bruschetta that they offer, I've eaten, and have enjoyed very much. You can't go wrong! The only dish that was less than satisfactory was the Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto; bleh.\n\nThis year, they introduced \""The Lighter Side of Tuscany\"" with menu items that have reduced calories (I believe they are all below a certain amount, say 600). I tried the INSALATA BRIO: Mixed greens, roasted red peppers, grilled asparagus, tomatoes, grapes and candied pecans tossed with an Italian vinaigrette and balsamic drizzle. Just 345 calories! Well, I removed the gorgonzola and asked for the dressings on the side, so that I could get it as \""Vegan\"" as possible. Very delicious!\n\nThey have a specials menu that is updated daily, so make sure to check it out because their seasonal cocktails are certainly worthwhile. Some of my favorites that were offered in the past (and I believe one may have become a permanent menu offering) are the STRAWBERRY BASIL LIMONATA (Muddled strawberries and basil in a limonata, so refreshing and yummy) and the APPLE CIDER MARTINI (A little brandy, apple cider, spiced rum, lemon juice, rimmed with cinnamon, YUMMM). I've recreated both cocktails at home and it has consistently been a crowd-pleaser."
3,"Old Navy is one of those places that I totally forgot existed until my sister became employed there. Now, I shop here at least twice a month. They are forever having some kind of clearance or sale going on and they a lot of sizes. I believe they go from an XS to a XXL, however, if they do not have your size in stock, they will call over to the West side Old Navy or order it for you online. I have found it that online does have more plus size apparel. They sale shoes, accessories, skirts, dresses, shorts, hats, bags, graphic t-shirts and so on. Great store to go to if you're looking for a nice spring dress for a great price. You can also apply for a credit card and get approved immediately."
2,"If I could give it a 3.5 stars I'd do that instead.\n\nFor this trip to Vegas I decided to try out Craftsteak because of two things; 1) my buddy Henzel highly recommended it and, 2) Cherlynn N, a \""friend\"" of mine through Yelp also gave it a 4.5 stars and not only do I love her reviews but our tastes are very similar when it comes to eateries.\n\nI would have also started my review exactly the way Cherlynn N wrote her first paragraph about Craftsteak (except for the bf part) and Tom Colicchio on Top Chef.\n\nNow let me break it down.\n\nAtmosphere was excellent except for the cold air condition draft that was blowing direct to my gf.  Otherwise it was hip, good lighting, and the noise level was good where we could talk to each other without yelling across the table.\n\nWe decided to go with the pre fixe meal of $140 each for the wagyu beef selections.  This pre fix includes a cup each of their lobster bisque, 3 half orders of any of their salads, 3 half orders of any of their sides, 3 dessert.  Being the wagyu filet my lady decided to get was just $105 by itself, this pre fix deal is worth it!\n\nThe bread - 5 stars.  Let's say they were like freshly baked hawaiian bread but only lighter, brushed with butter on top and sprinkled with sea salt.  We would go back to Craftsteak just for this bread!  You get six pieces at the table.  We asked for another tray and also had an order to-go.  Ain't no shame to our game!\n\nLobster bisque - 3 stars.  I was so looking forward to this as it's knows as one of their signature dishes.  While it was tasty it was overly \""herbed\"".  That blew it.  The bisque at Farallon in SF is much better.\n\nAppetizers: Caesar salad, Roasted beet salad, Italian Buffalo Mozzarella.  The Caesar was very good.  It's not chopped romaine lettuce but served whole leaf.  The dressing is tasty and light.  I would order that again.  The beet salad was also very good.  Various different types of beets.  Another order again.  The mozzarella fell flat, not big deal.\n\nOh and we also ordered the seared scallops which were very tasty.\n\nTwo glasses of wine and we were ready for the 2nd half of the meal and that's where things actually went relatively downhill.\n\nSides: mushroom assortment, potato puree, spinach.  All three to me were really no big deal.  So not much to write about here.\n\nSteaks:  As I said my lady had the wagyu filet while I decided to order the wagyu skirt, their most popular cut.  This is what I hated.  Both steaks came served to us ALREADY CUT INTO PIECES!!  This is like the cardinal rule of steak!  Pre-cut steak just lets all the juices out.  WTH?  Why do they do that?  So I tried to let that go and just hope that the taste of the steaks make up for it.  It didn't.  I just couldn't tell the difference between wagyu and a nice choice cut.  Made me think that wagyu continues to be overrated in my book or I just still haven't found a meat establishment that can win me over about wagyu beef.\n\nDessert:  So we had the popular monkey bread and they gave us 3 other complimentary desserts; a lemon thing, two scoops of ice cream (strawberry and lemon), and a small dish of fruit.  By then we were already stuffed and had a few bites of each.  Again no big deal.\n\nBottom line:  Craftsteak will still be on our list to go the next time we're in Las Vegas.  But instead, we would sit at the bar, have a couple serving of their bread, some appetizers and continue on with the evening plans from there.\n\nSorry Tom - Please pack your knives and go.  And don't ever cut my steak again!"
4,this place has my favorite panang anywhere. The Thai coffee and sticky rice is good too!
2,"The prices are good & there friendly i went in 1st time for a fill probably 1 hr befor they close, the only thing i didn't like was that when she did my fill you can still see the line from before & i hate that cuz i feel everyone sees it . And she didnt fully take the glitter i had from before."
2,This was a nice place to go study. Loved my ice tea. Glad to support  local business.
0,Service is good but the food was absolutely horrible do not get the bananas foster it's pure brown sugar with bananas.  It is so grotesquely sweet that you can't even eat good luck!
1,My husband and I have been going here off and on for about 10 months. Service is alright but food is pretty bland. We had the spinach con queso and it had no flavor to it at all. The tacos are super small and the fajitas also were pretty tasetless. The last time we went they raised the house wine cost by almost 50%!!!! It is ridiculous to charge $7 for a house glass of wine. They raised a lot of their other costs and it is not even worth it. There are so many other places to go. Really?!?!  $7 for a house wine. I don't think so.
3,"If you want to bring out all the haters, flamers & trolls, just dare to say something positive about either our popular President, or Olive Garden!     :-O\n\nNow on my last OG visit a couple of weeks ago even some of my Yelp friends were raving about how much better Romano's Macaroni Grill is compared to this place, so we cooked up an UYE for tomorrow 4/4/13 at 11 AM at Romano's on Gold Dust Av. in Scottsdale & YOU'RE INVITED TOO!     :-)\n\nFor this outing today I was joined by Arlin B. & Scott W. to get a fresh taste of OG to have ready to compare to Romano's tomorrow.  I thought the food was in top form but the service was a little weak, so I'm dropping them down to about 3 1/2 Stars this time, rounded up to 4.\n\nThe only Romano's I have visited was the one over in Valencia, CA several years ago, before I joined Yelp, so it will be virtually brand new for me.  Romano's is more expensive, so it will have to be really good to win.  I'm all for loving it & hope to see YOU there too!     :-))\n\nMeanwhile, my order today was for Olive Garden's \""All-You-Can-Eat Soup, Salad & Breadsticks.\""  $6.99.     :-))"
2,"Friendly service and what seemed to be good sale prices. I'll be doing a bit more shopping in this next week to decide if this is the place to buy a safe or if my money's better spent elsewhere, so far they're in the lead."
0,"Today i went to this place after reviewing yelp. I expected a lot because of good review. Unfortunately, it did not work on me at all. I waited 20 minutes and then a guy got into my room and started massage. After 10 minutes, he tried not to do his best. It seemed that he was too tired of giving massage to his customer. I was getting bad feeling because of his attitude.\n\nFinally, I got very mad at him and did not leave him a tip. This was worst massage that I ever had.\n\nPlease be lucky guys."
4,"If you thought the Jabbawockeez were great in ABDC... they are 100 times better in their Las Vegas show MUS.I.C at the MGM Grand Hollywood Theatre. \n\nDirected by Nappytabs and joined by a few members of SuperCrew, this show will definitely not disappoint! Buy your ticket before it's too late!\n\nCheck out the teaser video of the pre-show entertainment: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtwkGDxfyUQ"
4,"Had the #2 breakfast special. Melt in your\n mouth pancakes n tje best bacon in central Phoenix. Fast, friendly service too. About 11 bucks with tip. Recommend"
4,"Go here! and bring your friends! this place is amazingly fun. I've been to Vegas a few times, but I just recently discovered this place on my most recent visit.  When you walk in you are greeted with a much-appreciated whoosh of cold air and the smell of apples (strange, but true, everyone commented on the apple scent).  Inside there are random areas for seating, including a big bed and several huge lovesac bean bag chairs.  Outside there are more seating areas with comfy patio furniture to sit on and watch your friends play giant Jenga or giant beer pong or cornhole.  There is a counter where you can check out board games to play including Operation, Lasers, and Cards Against Humanity.  My only issue is that no one is stationed at the counter and you are supposed to ask your server to bring you a game, but we could never track down a server.... we just ordered drinks from the bar.  They had a live band there that started playing outside at 10 pm.  While I usually love live music, it was a little too loud to still comfortably talk to friends."
1,"It is Friday August 8 2014 and I am at the Red Rock for the Hip Hop Championships. Checked in to my kids' room yesterday and was told that the adjoining room for my husband and myself would be ready early this morning after 11 am check out. I ended up waiting the entire day for the room after calling and visiting the front desk more than 5 times only to find at 4:30 pm that the room was still occupied by the previous night's guests! A detailed account of my experience is below but suffice it to say that 5 staff members throughout the day decided that this very important detail was not worth mentioning even when I expressed concern because the guests next door were obviously partying late into the night.\n\nIt could be a very nice hotel if it had better customer service.\n\nThe plus side:\n-lots of restaurants\n-relaxing modern dark brown color scheme\n-nice pool\n-security dealt with a loud noise issue immediately when I called to complain\n\nThe negatives:\n-not the best housekeeping (dusty room)\n-can't recommend the Grand Cafe - water glasses smell like my dog when she needs a bath and the waitress could not give us correct info about the menu and didn't get our order right. The coffee was also terrible.\n-front desk staff does not provide accurate information\n\nI hope this review helps someone make a decision about the hotel, but more importantly, I hope that it helps the hotel improve on their customer service.\n\n\nDetails of my room issue:\n\nWent to front desk after noon and asked about the status. Told that the room was not ready yet and to check back later. They said they would put a \""rush\"" on the room. Went back at 2:30pm and was told again the room was not ready. Since I was awakened at 3:00 am by loud laughing and other \""strange\"" noises from the adjoining room, I was concerned and asked if there was a problem. Was told that they only knew the room was not yet cleaned and that they would call my cell phone when it was available. I asked if I could check in and just come down to get the keys when it was ready, they said no. Went back to wait in my kids room.\n\nAt 3:20pm (past check in time) I decided to call the front desk and was told that the room was not yet ready. I asked again if there was a problem and told them that I wanted to unpack and use the shower. I was told that I would get a call when it was ready.\n\nAt 4:00 pm I called again and spoke to Minnie. She said that the room was not ready but that I had to come downstairs to \""pre-check\"" in. I explained that I was told earlier that I could not check in until the room was ready. She said she would check and call me back. I asked her to please call back within 10 minutes since I was tired of waiting in the kids' room. She promised she would.\n\nAt 4:15, still no call but I heard a knock on the door of the adjoining room. Opened my door to see a housekeeper standing at the door. I asked her if the room was ready. She said she was checking - she opened the door, quickly closed it, and said that \""they\"" were still there. \""They\"" were obviously the loud guests from the night before.\nI hurried downstairs to complain that no one had bothered to tell me that the guests from the previous night had not yet left. If I had known that, I would have asked them to get me another room instead of waiting for 4 hours in my kids room thinking I would get a call any minute to check in.\n\nMaria, an assistant manager, apologized and gave me another room but she said that there were no adjoining rooms available for my kids. By this time I am exhausted waiting for my room and for my shower so I take the room, despite the fact that my kids are still in a room next to people who party (loudly) late into the night. Called Patrick Wallace, the manager twice to ask him to call me about the problem but no response yet."
0,Not a JCPenney customer- but I have been following the news about the total image change for the store. Every Day low prices and really liked the last ad booklet in the sunday paper. Well- upon arriving at the store- there was very limited sizes- not the color selection as advertised- I was planning on a major shoping spree for spring- needless to say- when I finally found a sales associate she suggested that I look at the merchandise in petites or womans sizes? Really?? I am 5'9'' and a size 10. So I left-only bought 2 shirts - JCP definitely need better distribution of merchandise (size and colors) to the stores.. or more saavy buyers! Oh- and when I asked if the merchandise was back ordered- the associate had no idea what that meant!
1,"We went to Macaroni Grill a couple weeks ago and were extremely disappointed with pretty much everything about the experience. The service was slow at best on a not very busy night. The food did not taste fresh at all, in fact tasted as if it had been cooked two days prior and just nuked in the microwave. My wife ordered what our waitress said was the \""best item on the menu\"" and it was quite tasteless. I had the Italian trio sampler which was bland. We will undoubtedly never go there again."
4,"The interior is completely redone and it looks nice. Lots of tvs, granite bar tops, nice tables and they still have the pool table! They have a great happy hour everyday and their menu is extensive. I ordered the wings, GAP combo (choice of pizza and salad 8$) and my boyfriend had the American sliders.\nThe pizza was the best. I got chicken pesto and the dough was soo good. The wings were crispy, which I like. The fries are fresh you can tell they make them from scratch. The sauce on the sliders was different, I'm not sure how I feel about it. the waitress/bartender was super friendly and always kept my drink filled. She also remembered what I liked, which was nice."
2,"I came in to Best Buys a few times before Christmas and was shocked at the reduced size of their DVD section. Now mind you, I shouldn't be that surprised since I buy music and some videos online these days. \n\nBut, I use to enjoy visiting their long 5 or 6 rows of movies that are now squeezed into the former music section. Wow! That was a shocker for me. From what I could tell, the cameras and PS3/ X-Box sections were the main beneficiaries at DVDs expense. \n\nThe other shocker was the prices for most items. In a few exceptions, I found I didn't see many bargains -- that is the prices I've seen advertised online and elsewhere were as good, if not better than Best Buy! Again, WOW. I had always viewed Best Buy as the low price leader, not anymore! Now, even Walmart has gotten into the act. \n\nSo, I was left to wonder if the demise of Circuit City was viewed as an opportunity by Best Buy management to boost prices? If it was, then I believe management may have made a huge miscalculation.. Why buy a HDMI cable and plug for over $35 at Best Buy, when you can shop elsewhere and find it for just $10. Sorry, what am I missing? \n\nGuys (and Gals), you need to wake up and smell the coffee, because if you don't then next year you may be an 1 Star after thought. \n\nSorry!"
3,"If you are in this area and looking for a place to grab some lunch this is a good place to go.  This is purely and simply a place where you can get a good lunch that will fill you up without much expense on your part.  Go elsewhere and you'll get a small pie and a cookie and you'll have spent all your money without actually making any impact on your hunger.\n\nMost of the takeaways or cafes in this immediate area don't offer good value for money, but this place is the exception.  Most of the people I've spoken to who regularly come here are very complimentary and I don't think I've ever heard a bad word about it."
2,"Came here twice thanks to Groupon...and it may be awhile until I return. The first time Groupon decided to work on its site when I wanted to pull up my Groupon on my phone so I couldn't use it and had already ordered so ended up paying full price. Not a happy camper.\n\n It has good food and a nice seating area, but it is a little overpriced for such small portions. The paninis are on a big piece of bread but have the smallest amount of contents! The soup was good but not anything I would make a special visit here for. The Greek salad was also good but lacked on toppings. Everything is very fresh, which they charge you for, but you don't get much of it. My pizza crust was literally BLACK from being burned so bad. Sadly I did take out on my that visit and did not realize it until I got home. Needless to say I threw half of my $10 mini pizza away. \n\nFor being a \""fast service\"" place their prices were very high and both times I went in the only other people there were employees, sitting at the tables eating. No wonder they put a Groupon out, business must be slow!"
1,"I really want to like this place better. By the looks of the photos on here I think I just had a below average experience. \n\nWe went this July - knew it would be crowded and it was. No biggie, we were prepared to have a drink while we waited anyways and found two barstools open at the bar! I ordered the Brandy Slush - a past favorite of my wives. It wasn't mixed right - was way too sweet and didn't have the right mix - and the bartender was a bit of a jerk. No big deal, but probably won't get that again. \n\nSaw a co-worker at the bar who told us they love love love the Cheese Curds here. My first mistake was not ordering any. I guess I wasn't in a fried cheese curd mood - plus I ended up ordering the Mac and Cheese with Ring Bologna and figured that would be enough cheese. Maybe it had to do with the fact that it was Summer and hot - but I did not enjoy the Mac and Cheese and Ring Bologna. The cheese sauce was not yummy or impressive and although the Ring Bologna may have been of good quality - it wasn't what I expected. Might have been better on a super cold wintery night. My wife got a sandwich and that looked much better.\n\nService was OK considering they were packed full and had a good waiting list. From the photos online and other dishes I saw around me, I think I'll give this place another try - but from this first visit I wasn't impressed."
3,"Charlotte is awash in good steakhouses and BLT Steak is a nice addition.  I've visited the NYC location so had a sense of what to expect.  Great steak, great wine list, hopefully great service, with a little ambience thrown in for good measure.\n\nBright and modern with a slightly funky vibe, the restaurant is pretty to look at while sipping a wonderfully made martini in the bar before dinner.  (I might stop mentioning martinis in my reviews because they're starting to add up...lol.)  Nonetheless, you can't go wrong here.  My beloved lemon drop was just tart enough to start the evening off nicely.\n\nI dined with someone who's probably a learned oenophile and he seemed pleased with the wine choices.  In fact, the sommelier came over after he made a selection from the Paso Robles region and suggested another wine from the same region available via BLT's private stock. While I may not have been able to tell much difference between selection 1 and selection 2, this red blend was divine.  (Oh dear - we're still discussing alcohol...onward Yelpers!)\n\nAnd so, to the meal.  Surprisingly, no wedge with blue cheese, which I love prior to eating steak but the Caesar was good.  Crisp, cold romaine with very fresh Parmesan cheese and housemade croutons.  Lovely.\n\nMe - Bone-in ribeye.  Him - New York strip.  Us - Grilled asparagus.  Assessment - awesome!  Both steaks were fresh, prepared to perfection and served in the finishing skillet (I presume).  The marbling in the ribeye was perfect with the bone-in choice providing even more flavor.  There is simply no way any normal human can consume an entire steak at this place.  Quite generous portioning being the reason.\n\nNo dessert for us as we preferred to continue sipping from that great bottle of wine. \n\nFour stars only and I was torn here. Our service was adequate overall (though the sommelier was quite the nice guy), with our server being efficient but not very personable.  Hey - I like a smile with my meal, a little light banter perhaps.  Make the diners feel welcome.  So, taking a star off for that reason alone. A smile costs nothing and gains much.\n\nYou cannot go wrong at BLT Steak.  Bon appetit Charlotteans!"
0,"First with the good, every tasted good.  Now the bad one the price to start and the portions.  The pizza we purchased was 40.00 and maybe should have been 20.00.  The large pizza is the size of any regular small pizza.  We tryed it because it was new to us and will never be back.  Don't waste your time or money try Pullanos a real pizza place."
3,"Yes I'm entertained! With the overabundance of reality stars and the dazzling lights of the LED chandeliers and the ceiling graphics this nightclub-esque bar is spot to be at. I agree with previous reviews how it's a great place just to people watch because my time there with three of my girlfriends led to them being magnets of the many reality stars (of the VH1 kind) who would talk them up to the point of annoyance. It's an exciting space at the corner of the first floor of the Cosmopolitan by the casino and across The Henry. You see the LED lights changing to the beats of the music, the dj is spinning (and actual vinyl decks =)) and by the windows facing the strip, you see these \""floating\"" pods where there are go-go dancers. The visual excitement at this place goes to overdrive, so much to see!\n\nDrink prices here was actually the highlight of our stay at the Bond, everything was moderate priced and worth it. Champagne was around $13/glass and the signature Cosmo (with the blood orange garnish) which was OH SO YUM was $12. This bar/lounge is gorgeous, drinks are good, plenty of space to roam, and the tunes great! Totally recommend this place and a must stop whether you pass by the Cosmo, walk the strip or are a guest at the hotel. love it! =)"
4,"Why does this place have to be so far away? The brats are amazing. The pretzels are the best I've ever had. And the beer cheese... one day I will learn how make something that tastes as good at home. And then have to start running weekly marathons.\n\nThe beer selection is great. There is plenty on tap and the prices are pretty reasonable. Where else can you get a German Oktoberfest on tap in March?\n\nPretty much everything is made on site. The pretzels, the brats, even the sauerkraut is made here and from local ingredients. If you end up sampling a lot, the price can get high fast but if you just come in for a brat it can be a reasonable lunch."
1,"Went there to get a good photo to use on Linkdin and other job search sites.  They wanted to use two background colors.  I knew the darker color would look like crap and I was right, but I'll give them credit for trying.  After my photos were taken their way-too-complicated computerized photography system locked up.  They had to call tech support.  40 minutes later if finally got fixed.  They offered me a discount for my trouble.  They'd give me 3 photos on the CD for the price of one.  I reminded them for the 35th time that the photo was just for use on job search websites and I only wanted one.  They gave me a discount for one.  It still cost over $40.00.  RIP OFF!!!!!!!!  I would have done better training my cat how to use my camera at home.  The reason I gave them two stars is that I don't normally photograph well and the one picture I did buy looked OK.  Sears in the olden days of wet film did this whole thing a lot better though."
3,"Seems like one of the only spots to grab breakfast downtown aside from a chain. Good egg/meat platters (home fries were bomb!!) and awesome pancakes. No frills, no complaints, good value."
0,"GO TO PLAN B!  This is NOT a shop you want to give your business!  I have been a very good and generous customer for too many years.  If you are in Linda's chair (one of the owner's) you will get an excellent cut/color BUT, you will wait!!!!  And wait.  I can't remember a time I raced to get there and did not have to wait 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, even an hour, b/c she tries to do too many things,  and so, you wait!!!!  Also, I recently went to get a hair cut and she lost her focus, b/c she had to stop and finish someone and then stop again to check foils and then stop again to answer questions and she totally changed my style (that I was growing out 6-7 months) and she knew when I left I was not happy, but she said to blow it out myself tomorrow and it would be okay, it wasn't and when I told her it was a terrible, the worst, with no rhyme or reason, and that it took me an hour to blow out and how frustrated I was, she imploded on me for 40 min, telling me she couldn't look at me!  It was ALL about HER and not my terrible hair cut that I had to force her to fix, making it even shorter and still treated me horribly, no one believes my story, that ME, being the customer, she didn't care or try to make it better at MY convenience,and after all those years.  Her partner, her sister offered me a refund, I never asked, and I still have the voicemail confirming our talk and the refund and yet, no refund. After all the wks of aggrevation and  frustration, they shot their integrity to hell over a $49 check!  REALLY?  STAY AWAY!  There are many other salons that do really good work and you are geared to the customer.  I found one I love and there were many recommendations to me.  So, go to Plan B, Plan A, Hairtique, nah!"
3,"Called in to put our name down. It's located near the shops at Mandalay Bay, near Lush Beauty and a candy store. Be ready to stack up $$ on your burgers. \n\nFOOD:\nTurkey burger (4 stars): Customized with wheat bread, fried egg, avocado, American cheese, and mushrooms. All burgers come with the standard lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle. Turkey was cooked well and was moist. \n\nVeggie patty (3.5 stars): A little dry but looked much better than any other turkey patty I've seen. \n\nSkinny and Fat Fries (4 stars): I usually love skinny fries but I liked the fat ones more here. Nice and crunchy. \n \nNutella Shake (5 stars): Do not come here when you are trying to eat healthy because this was the best thing that I had here. SO FREAKING GOOD. Well anything with nutella is always good, but this was extra good! \n\nCoke float(4 stars): Also really good (= They make good shakes. \n\nService (5 stars)\nOur waitress was awesome. They mixed up a couple of fries on our order but fixed it right away. She kept up with all our requests, and for a group of 10 we had no problems. \n\nATMOSPHERE (5 stars)\nCool burger place. They have nice big booths to sit in also, with a small TV at the end. We had too big of a group to sit there though. \n\nThe hostess girls in the front were fake nice. Almost made me not want to eat here. Sorry I asked how long the wait was girls, but we had 3 kids in our group and kids go crazy without food. All you were doing was standing in the front anyway!"
2,"Not too sure what to make of this place.  One minute it looks like a bar the next it feels like someone's home with a marble countertop. The kitchen is open so you can see what's going on.  Seems like that's a popular way to design restaurants these days or is it suppose to be a tavern? hmm?\n\nI ordered the Bison Burger with some sweet potato fries. I was hoping for a plate full of fries, but I got at best 10 pieces!  If I told you this was a tavern and you got 10 pieces of fries would you believe me?  Yeah...right me either. Guess I need to super size it next time.  I ordered my Bison medium, but it definitely came medium well to well done.  I thought it was a bit plain and dry. With such an ingredient they should probably add some bang to give it some pop!  \n\nDrinks here are pretty cheap I thought. Nathan the bartender is pretty cool guy and was attentive.  Great Job! - Enjoy!"
2,"Sunday champagne brunch was nothing spectacular, but the quality was exceptional. There are too many other amazing choices in this town for locals, so I will probably not return."
0,I've expect more from this joint !\nYou can't compare with any other US joint
3,"I know its a chain, I also know its not authenic Mexican food, but every now and again I get a Taco Bell craving I just have to satisfy!\nPlus if you make some wise menu choices, you can eat good without ingesting a whole lot of fat grams. For example, I get 2 steak soft tacos fresco style which is pico de gallo instead of cheese and sour cream. The pico is very good and you can taste the fresh cilantro. This drops the fats grams to only 4 each. Add a side of rice (only 3 fat grams)  cover in fire sauce and add an unsweet tea or diet coke and you eatin' good for only 11 grams of fat! Pretty good from a fast food joint, huh? I also get a side of guacamole that really good, but I don't count it as it has it has all the good kinds of fats that are good for you! A win win situation.\nI aslo thinks its pretty damn tasty! Thats right, I said it, I LIKE TACO BELL!!\nPlus most locations I have been in are clean and the counter service is friendly.\nI don't eat here once a week or even once a month, but when the craving does hit, I'm  thinking outside the box and making a run for the border!"
1,"Was excited to try a new burger place while in casa grande for work. I'd heard about these butter burgers so figured it was time. I had the cheddar bacon butter burger and on the cashiers suggestion the cheese curds. I wasn't impressed.  It wasn't horrible, but wasn't good. The cheese curds were nothing special. I didn't enjoy them. The girls that helped me were nice, but I won't be having another burger there. If I must go back I will try the custard."
0,"By far one of the worst experiences I've had at a bar in Arizona. \n\nWalked in on a Friday night and sat at the bar since we were only looking for drinks. Upon waiting 10 minutes for a bartender to notice us (not even that busy), my friend and I took notice how the entire staff looked miserable. Not a single smile, laugh, or friendly acknowledgment to coworkers or patrons, instead everyone looked incredibly unapproachable.  After now waiting 15 minutes, an alcohol distributor came by and offered us free drinks - which we graciously accepted. It was once this lady had left that a bartender finally noticed us and seemed very upset with serving us only water at that point. First round of drinks were great- and we decided to have another round. Again, it took 20 minutes for a bartender to even acknowledge us even with two drinks sitting empty in front of us. All the while, two other ladies stopped by and asked us why is it so hard to get a drink, at which I answered we've been waiting for forever, and they intelligently decided to leave. We asked for the same drink as received prior a Sol-Rita and this time a Champagne-Rita. Both of these drinks this time tasted awful - no consistency with the same Sol-Rita as prior. Even more so, no salt was added to the drinks! After sitting for 10 minutes and not even drinking the Champagne-rita, a different bartender asked if we were ok. I then informed him that the one drink particularly was not good and before I could even finish my sentence, he grabbed the drink and threw it away and proceeded to make a new one. Not once was there any sort of acknowledgment to show sorry for the situation. \n\nAvoid at all costs, there are so many other places in Tempe Market Place that have friendly staff and better prices!"
4,"I just moved to the area and live near this park. I was actually surprised to find a little park right here in South Side. I love the river front trail. it's very quaint & peaceful here for it being South Side, lol. I'm very lucky to have this within walking distance."
2,After visiting Tottie's a few more times recently it seems at the owners/management is failing at quality control. Less attention is paid to detail and the taste is losing its pizzazz. I really hope they reflect on internal quality so the restaurant doesn't continue its downward trend.
4,Easily in my top 5 restaurants in Charlotte. The Mussels are to die for! I can always count on this place for being consistently awesome and is always the first restaurant i take any guests from out of town to impress them. As for brunch...don't even get me started. It's Heaven in a buffet.  You just can't lose with this place.
0,"My husband and I have been \""regulars\"" at Yasu since we discovered it. However, given the poor treatment we received last week, we will not be returning.  We were entertaining 2 business associates and I called around 4 pm to ensure hours and make a reservation. I was told that I wouldn't need a reservation for four around 6:30 pm. We arrived promptly at 6:30, but were told that it would be at least an hour wait. I spoke with the manager about the phone call, noting recognition in his eyes, but he told me that he couldn't do anything at all to help us because he had taken several reservation after I called. I mentioned that I was specifically told that I wouldn't need a reservation. He said he would be happy to make a reservation for me if I call in the future. Well, that just won't be happening. He then scurrried away and hid at the bar, allowing his equally rude hostess to deal with us, even after asking to speak with him again. The immature way in which this incident was handled leads me to believe that Yasu can't make good when they make a mistake. If they just would have made some accomodation to note the mistake of not giving me a reservation, I would not be posting this, but just can't let this go and felt my fellow diners should beware - you're SOL if Yasu makes a mistake."
1,"I used to love this place a couple of years ago, what happened??? I always got their Bankok Pad Thai Noodles with veggies and added chicken and it was great! Today my boss offerred to buy lunch for everyone and we decided on EB because it's right across the street. \nSadly every single order was either poorly made, over cooked or in my case- completely wrong! \n\nI was looking forward to hot, sticky, carb-y, noodle-y goodness and wound up with some hard, fire-blasted chicken turds on top of a green salad with tomatoes, cucumbers and wonton strips. Someone from EB wrote \""thai\"" on it and that's how I figured out it was mine (since there were no noodles). Very VERY disappointing. Hopefully it was just a really really crappy day for them and an equally crappy lunch for me and my co-workers."
0,"if $20 per person for all-you-can-eat sushi sounds too good to be true, then it's probably too good to be true.  the 1st red flag should have been AUCE sushi.  think about it, if you were the owner of the restaurant, would you put out 5 star sushi so that people can scarf it all down for $20?\n\ni guess it's just as much my fault for believing a korean barbecue restaurant would have semi-spectacular sushi.\n\nwhatever you do, don't let the hostess convince you to sit in the little \""black hole\"" room with the \""sushi\"" sign on the doorway even if you're only going to order the AYCE sushi (which is a mistake in itself).\n\nwe were left in there for about 15mins to peruse(?) the menu.  we finally checked off a few rolls and were waiting for the waiter to come back and take our order sheet, all the while we could see the sushi chef standing there twiddling his thumbs secretly laughing that he was getting paid to do nothing.  \n\ni finally figured i could just take the slip of paper up to him myself, so i did.  he seemed a little taken aback, but took the paper reluctantly and pretended to start our order.  i say that because it seemed to take another 10 or so minutes for them to bring us the 1st role.  by then we were so famished, that we scarfed it down like a pack of rabid wolves.  it tasted ok, but i couldn't tell if it was because i was so grateful to have something to eat or if it really tasted great.\n\ni've heard it said that they purposefully bring you a roll every 10-15 minutes so that you won't order more than you can eat (in which the rules state that any left over food will trump the AYCE price of $20 and they reserve the right to change the pricing structure to full price for each roll/nigiri that is not eaten)  \n\nfair enough, but anyone who's ever eaten at an AYCE joint, knows full well that if you eat too slow, you will invariably eat about 1/3 of what you would have eaten if you were allowed to eat at your own \""natural\"" pace (haha).  so by the time we got  to the 3rd of 5 rolls, we ended up choking down the less than stellar 2 remaining rolls in fear of being charged the full price for the whole meal.\n\nyeah, i must admit that it was not such a great idea to order \""fillers\"" such as tempura, but the batter was like a batter that you would find on a beer battered onions rings at the local BBQ joint.  it was thick, doughy and tasteless.  i guess i'm used to thin, light and crispy tempura batter that i've had at other japanese restaurants.\n\nif you plan on taking me there for the AYCE sushi and say that you'll pay for me, my wife and 1 y/o daughter, don't be offended if i decline. you'll thank me later b/c i'll have saved you a ton of money"
0,"Started the adventure around a year ago. Food and service so bad my husband complained and received a comp. We didn't want to go back there, so we redeemed it at their sister property, Silver Nugget . Tried again @ Opera House 2 wks ago, hubby was reeled in by 16oz t-bone for $5.99. Bad decision. Steak coated in pepper. Returned that and hard as nail potato. Results in another comp, $15 this time. Entire time , mgmt horrified their staff is that horrible. We take my father, probably for amusement value @ this point. Green beans are not seasoned, at all. We ask for them to be sent back, seasoned. Waitress brings back, in same bowl , with pepper liberally shaken on. I know this is a ghetto- fabulous casino, but pepper on everything ? We inform the manager, whom has  a pow wow w kitchen staff . They smugly\n inform us we are no longer welcome. As if...I invite the manager to sample the green beans. She declines , stating she, the 90 lb skinny broad is not picky about her food. It's obvious the food that goes down her gullet passes stringent tests, unlike the employees she hires or the food they serve. Better off  as a snack bar."
0,"We tried this for lunch on a Saturday. We were the first people to arrive for lunch a little after 11 AM. The server didn't mention the specials...we saw them on the way out. We ordered appetizers that appeared to be reheated a bit, they were not hot or very warm at all. The soup was brought out while we were eating our appetizers, shortly afterward the entrees were brought out while we were still eating our appetizers. The lamb masala had good flavor for left overs. The same for my wife's vegetable vindaloo. Naan is an extra charge, soup  is included. All in all, clueless service as far as normal meal service goes (but polite). Reheated food passed off as made to order. For  a $31 lunch I would rather check out a buffet for $10 less for two people."
3,"I decided to pretend that I was a well-to-do person with no cares in the world, and I took a sudden, two-day trip to Vegas on a complete whim. Decided at 10:00 am, bought my ticket at 11:00, flew out at 3:00 and by late afternoon I was in Vegas. I met my parents, and made the executive decision to not go see Viva Elvis. Instead, I took the time to look around Aria, Cosmopolitan, etc. and wondered if I could find a good cocktail. I decided on Sage, and after telling myself I wasn't under-dressed, I wandered in and sat at the bar.\n\nNow, I personally do not think I am the most beautiful person on the planet, but I have come to the conclusion that I am not bad to look at, at least on my good days. And I was wearing a cute dress, and I put my confident face on. I ordered the \""tea rose\"" (tea infused Hangar One, rose water, st. germain, lemon, and a pine nut garnish) and settled in to wait for Elvis to let out. And then, out of nowhere, lovely businessmen started talking me up and invited me to dinner.\n\nBeing a tasteful, respectfully married woman, I had to decline, but honestly the vibe, the menu, and the drinks here had me trying to find any available way to get into said dinner while remaining a respectfully married woman. Sadly, I couldn't come up with any inventive way to do that, so I missed out on dinner. I did, though, get to take in the stylish/romantic/scene-y vibe, and apparently the extremely flattering lighting. Next time I have more time, or my husband in tow, or a relaxed set of morals, I'm taking myself back here and landing myself a dinner to go with my drink."
1,"We ordered a pizza; half sausage and half canadian bacon and medium wings.  The pizza was good and the wings were OK.  However, the customer experience was horrible.  We  called in our order and the person we spoke with did not ask any questions.  I asked him if he needed our name for the order which is something you should be asked.  I asked him how long before our order was ready and was told 20 minutes.  We went there 25 minutes later and our order was not ready; which no big deal it happens sometimes.  However, we ended up waiting an additional 20 minutes.  They gave us our order and just brought our a soda (we got one of the pizza, wing, soda deals) without asking what flavor we wanted. We walked out the door to leave and one of the employees comes out and tells us they didn't give us all of our wings.  We had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the rest of our order.\n\nThe employees all seemed pretty clueless when dealing with them.  They all spoke sparingly to customers.  We weren't even greeted when we walked in to pick up our order.  The atmosphere was not very welcoming.  \n\nAll in all, even though the food was good it didn't compensate for the wait and customer experience with the employees."
2,"beer and wings, what could be better? Barro's does it the right way....well almost the right way. A waitress would be nice instead of having to go up to the counter for a beer."
0,"I should've known my visit wasn't  going to fare well when our waitress mentioned \""We've been open for a week and working out all the kinks\"". Unfortunately, the kinks were not worked out by the time of our visit.\nThe interior is warm and inviting and caught our eye when we walked by. There is a bar as you walk in with some seating and the a larger dining room in the back. When I saw \""public house\"" as part of the restaurant's name, I was expecting a menu more focus on casual fare with a few sandwich options. Not the case here. With entrees in the high teens-low 20's and appetizers hovering around $10, the bill can get pretty high pretty quick. \nWhile the craft cocktails were worthy of their price point, the food was definitely not. I was impressed when the waitress steered my daughter away from the $15 adult mac and cheese and towards the version on the kids menu (she thought the adult maybe had too strong of flavors). I was not impressed to find out the bland kids version (served with ice cream) was $14. This is an absolute joke. My girlfriend went went the clans and mussels while I opted for the whitefish sticks appetizer and squash soup. The mussel/clam combo had a nice broth and served with grilled bread for dipping. But, for perhaps 7 mussels and another 6 clams, $16 is priced too high. My whitefish appetizer (with homemade chips) was fine but again overpriced ($10). On the other hand, my squash soup missed the mark severely. It took on the taste of the kale and was finished inexplicably with balsamic vinegar-completely masking the flavor of the creamy squash. \nParking is hard to come by (there is a space for patrons about a half block away) and with price points this high (and not having the food to match), I would be surprised if it lasts even a year. A shame as its a beautiful space."
0,"I have always wanted to try this place we don't have any in Florida. My thoughts is jack can stay I the box. It only got a star cause you have to do something. The food was awful, nasty just no!!"
0,"After 4 days of getting the run-around from multiple 'managers' I was told the part that was ordered did not come in, and that it would be another 3 days wait. My car is no longer drivable due largely to the repeated mishandling of the idler pulley replacement. \n\nI have requested a refund in full and will be taking my vehicle to another service. Save your money, time and sanity, stay away from this Midas."
0,"Why zero stars is not a viable option is beyond me, because this Del Taco has earned exactly that. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.\n\nI used to eat at this restaurant frequently, loved the value, and for the price the food was pretty good. Service was typically a bit bad, but they lowered my expectations at this location long ago.\n\nHowever, even for me the end of the line was after seeing a group of small live ROACHES poking out from the drain at the soda fountain. YES LIVE ROACHES. Never seen this before in a restaurant, ever.  Left immediately and will not be back. A quick check of the Maricopa County health site revealed they have had 4 consecutive checks, all with LIVE GERMAN ROACHES all over the cooking side of this place and the soda fountain. \n\nSo, unless a little unexpected crunch of insect protein is what you want in your fast food taco, I would not eat at this place. ZERO STARS."
3,"When I have been there I am one of just a couple of non-Asian people there, so that is a good sign. I really like the kimchee tofu soup (soondubu) and the bulgogi. They also give you the little side dishes, which I really like. They soup comes out steaming hot in a stone bowl. One tip - don't take the tofu soup home to eat the next day. The tofu absorbs all the liquid and you will have a big hunk of spicy tofu."
3,"great food, great service, romantic ambiance"
1,"Fry's Electronics is a place I go to in emergencies.  Unfortunately, when something breaks on my computer, it usually takes the whole thing down.  Forget about finding something at a decent price on Egghead and having it there in a couple days; no access to the internet means a trip to Fry's.\n\nAnd a trip to Fry's means finding out that they have everything - except the replacement part you need.  You see, that part, which you installed a year before, is now obsolete, and they don't sell it.  Never mind that millions of people are still using it because most of us can't afford to have bleeding edge technology and upgrade over every miniscule increase in speed or graphic ability, and that you can get it easily from an online store - to Fry's, it's obsolete.  The reason it's obsolete?  Because it's cheaper than the new item that they want you to buy.  The new item that requires buying three or four more new items along with it since your old equipment is not compatible with the new.  In this day and age, no computer means a third to a half of your communication with the outside world, and not to mention access to important parts of your life, is gone.  You're stuck watching as a $50.00 replacement spirals into the $500.00 range.\n\nOne thing that Fry's teaches you is preventative maintenance.  You learn to make sure you've got some money and that Egghead or Amazon has what you need in store the first time you even hear the slightest rattle or see the slightest flicker.  If not, it's back to Fry's - Virgil greets you at the door, you descend through the rings until, under the beating wings of the Beast himself, you gather everything you need and slowly wind your way through their service line and back to the Purgatory of their parking lot.  And Virgil's tried to sell you a bunch of candy on the way out as well."
0,"I bought a groupon and spent 3 weeks trying to get them to schedule with no response. I called and they said groupons were only allowed to schedule via email. They would not answer my emails and each time I emailed them I had to fill out the same extensive form. Forget it, it is not worth the time and frustration"
3,"Great pub...Always a great selection of rotating taps, including some locals. The food is good pub food, but everyone comes for the beer and patio (when weather is nice). Staff is very friendly and efficient. Stop by after work at least once a week for a few ice cold pints."
4,I love spas!  And this one is right up here at the top.  I had a facial with Theresa.  Her touch and voice were lovely.  She is from England and I just adore that accent. I am very hard to please being that I am an esthetician myself.  Always get the 80 min!\n\nMy massage was such a pleasant surprise.  When I booked it they told me there were no men that could be my therapist. But Eric is who picked me up.  I was very happy to receive my first hot stone massage in a purple colored room.  I just love the color purple. His hands were amazing.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas to see them both.
2,Your standard smokehouse food.  Food was good!
1,"English is a beautiful language. Cheap can mean either 1) low cost, and 2) low in quality. In this case, we have both forms. Dollar cheese slices, $5 gyro, $3.50 (not so) small poutine. Good deal? Well not if the food is gross. \n\nMeat lovers pizza had fake bacon on it, and although hot, just had no taste. As for the poutine, fries were \""mccaine\"", gravy was chemical orange, and the cheese was a mix of half-frozen curds and shredded mozzarella. Barely passable. \n\nOn a budget, or late night after a night of drinking, it'll do. Just expect cheap both ways."
3,"I am really picky about Thai places, maybe not as much so as Dan P., but this probably is a 3.5 star joint - bumping it up because the prices are right, service is friendly, and the makeover from its old space really makes a difference.\n\nThere are a wide range of lunch special choices for $5.99!  The Thai iced tea is really good and cheap too.  The salad dressing is a bit iffy but they have different soups each day of the week for lunch, and the lunch special includes soup, salad, and vegetarian eggroll.\n\nI have been to Chao 3 times for lunch - once ordering the chicken chili, once for the spicy basil eggplant, and once for the beef satay.  Overall, everything has been decent.  You get a choice of chicken, beef, pork or tofu unless the meat is already specified.  There are 2 noodle dishes on the lunch menu as well.\n\nWhat I have discovered is that the peanut sauce is really delicious.  Yesterday I ordered the beef satay lunch special - so we started with egg drop soup and basic salad.  Then, I received a beautiful plate (see photo) - it had 4 skewers of marinated beef which tasted great on their own but the peanut sauce elevated them, a mini cucumber-red onion salad, white steamed rice, and an eggroll with sweet dipping sauce.\n\nThis was plenty of food for the price and my friend eating with me decided she will definitely order beef satay next time.  For an affordable lunch and good service, stop in here."
1,So this is the first Indian place where my palak paneer was orange and not green and my roti was a wheat tortilla cooked on a stone. But it is a big portion for 5.50.

2,"I was here a few weekends ago, and I had a ton of fun. Staff was nice and our drinks were stiff. If you like to dance you'll be a fan."
2,"Came in with high expectations.\n\nWonderful surroundings, I love the New York concept here. And the area attracts a higher quality of person, which appeals to me.\n\nPlace was packed on a Friday night of course , drinks were good, lots of attractive people, and a FABULOUS band playing.\n\nHowever, the energy/vibe in the room didn't match the band's energy. There were many 40+ something men going after early to mid 20s girls/women. That resonated throughout the place. I actually walked around the entire venue to see if I \""felt\"" differently, but nope it was all over. \n\nNot only that but people were indifferent about dancing in groups with strangers. I was there with my wife and she doesn't really dance so I tried to casually get into a group of 3 or 4 and there was no welcoming. I was disappointed.\n\nSo we left after maybe 30-45 minutes, probably never to return, unless people start raving about the venue, which will mean either the people changed or new people have discovered it."
1,"Not impressed, Had spicy beef noodle and it was as flavorful as a can of beef noodle soup (generic)  and as spicy. The spring rolls were rubbery , just was disappointed but it was clean, nice place service was ok but somewhat complicated due to language but thats easily overlooked. My friend had the kobe beef as suggested by waitress and again nothing special."
2,"This place was really pretty and I enjoyed most of my stay here.  Where it lost a star was the air conditioning in the rooms was really annoying.  Phoenix is hot and you really need good AC in a hotel that is in the middle of the desert.  At night, no matter how cold me set it, it kept shutting off and then turning back on 3 min later. But, the on/off kept waking us up. IN addition, it would get really warm and uncomfortable.  So, we had a terrible night sleep.\nAs for the pluses:\n-the views were gorgeous\n-the staff was friendly\n-they had a neat plan where if you opted out of housekeeping for a day they'd give you a $5 credit at the bar.  \n-there were a lot of amenities.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to take advantage of too many of them."
1,"The Joint is small and intimate. Flirty guards and ushers, cute bartenders who wink. Upstairs has an nice view of the stage, but really seem too high up, unlike a house of blues. \n\nFor two nights, I saw the same band, Duran Duran, at two different locations at the Joint. First night I was in the front, but its very hard to see with size 20s fat Duranies allover the places pushing around as if it's a Korn mosh pit. So I went to the back. That's a good spot because it gives a good view of the screen, (unless a Duranie heffer blocks it.)\n\nThe second night I found out why it seems as though the front row is 2 inches taller than everyone. Basically, they put up a barricade that has a base ontop of the floor, which rises the first two row of people about 2 inches. So anyone behind them can't see. Luckily, I held my ground in a sea of Duranie hephers a few rows back pushing, and was on that barricade! I was infront of a speaker that had the bass up way too loud. \n\nBoth nights, I can agree that the acoustics need work. The sound could be better. \n\nAfter the show, you can only get out one door, so that's kind of like mooooving the herd. Then I got herded into Body English, the Joint's little sistah night club. \n\nThe next night I remember to avoid the mad rush into Body English."
0,"This shop should be called 'Spirit of Tacky'.\n\nIf one of those cheesy Scottish shops aimed at tourists, and a load of really low-quality chinese stuff had a lovechild, this would be it. Exceot this is much more overpriced.\n\nIf you want one of those freaky cats that waves it's mechanical paw at you non-stop (or, judging from the quality of most of the stuff in here, until said paw falls of or the batteries run out), then this is your place. Likewise, if you're after anything at all inside a glass ball filled with snowflakes to shake when you're bored (or living in an '80s timewarp) then fill your boots.\n\nOtherwise, the only reason you should even bother setting foot in this shop would be if you see your ex walking towards you, and need somewhere to hide until they've gone past."
0,"bad service, so far not impressed  with the food, had to ask for everything from straws to chips.  The enchiladas were some kind of red sauce the tacos suck, tripitas learn to cook them people.  The chips at least are fresh.  Come on now if you have a family restaurant cook like you want to keep customers."
1,It was just OK...nothing to ride home about. Probably won't go there again unless my usual place is packed. Well even the I'll wait.
0,Tourist trap. Like a bad cafeteria on top of Mt. Washington.
0,"Let me preface this by saying that over the years I have wanted to sign-up for yelp but have not for one reason or another. I would never want to publicly say something mean about a place of business; however my experience at Garage Boutique left me no choice but to sign-up and post a review. I have never, in all my life, been treated the way I was treated in this store. Picture Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman on Rodeo Drive; however a. I am not a hooker and b. Garage Boutique is not a shop on rodeo drive. The only similarity is the snotty, arrogant, rude manager/owner-whatever she might be.  I was not looking to simply browse that day.  I  was on a mission for a few gifts and found them in this store. Never-mind making a purchase, the sour customer care made it impossible for me to actually give this boutique anything more then a look of shock at their nightmarish treatment of potential customers. Simply put, do yourself a favor and shop somewhere else. All their designer merchandise can be found online or in stores that actually represent the kind people of Arizona and not the vapid management from the Garage.  I am returning to Arizona with a group of girls who are pregnant/have children. We will not be going to this store; which is a shame because they did have some cute things. \n\nOn principle, I refuse to give them any business. There are better stores in Arizona that do not operate under the premise that you should feel honored to be able to shop in their store. Business must be good to treat people the way they do."
4,"We went here for a friend's birthday dinner. I loved this place. I am pretty picky on my Thai food, but I was immediately impressed when I tried to the Taro Crunch appetizer that my girlfriend picked out. My main dish was the basil fried rice that was so delicious that I cleaned up my entire hefty portion. The atmosphere is nice and it is located right on the main drag in Squirrel Hill. I am looking forward to coming back to this place ASAP."
4,"Sooooo excited that I moved near this place. The food is so good for drive-thru Mexican & the staff is really nice, too. \nThe breakfast burritos are delicious, the dinner options are so tasty, and their 'street tacos' are the bomb. Me gusta!"
2,"So it was our first night in Ediburgh, and our group couldn't agree where to eat. We walked up and down the Royal Mile looking for a place that had something for everyone. Looking at the posted menu on the door, it seemed like this place would do the trick.\n\nWe walk in and it's an American themed restaurant! Leave it to us to travel halfway around the world to eat at a place just like home. Even the menu called them \""fries\"" instead of \""chips\""!\n\nI had a bacon cheeseburger, and the bacon is quite a bit different in Scotland than back home. Instead of thin crunchy strips you get a bigger piece of fried pork. It's more like a slice of lunchmeat than american bacon. Still good though. The burger was very good. The waitstaff was attentive (and one of the guys in our group even tried to get her phone number - sheesh. College kids!!)\n\nI'm knocking off a star for the bathrooms though. Truly disappointing. Everything was wet as if there was a leak in a pipe or faucet. The stalls were dirty and broken. There were no paper towels or ways to dry your hands. Just awful facilities downstairs.\n\nAs an American reviewing an American themed eatery abroad though, they did a pretty good job getting it right. The decor and music were spot on for the 50's. The classic comfort foods and american fare were all there. It's pretty legit. Like going to an Applebee's here in the states."
3,Very good steakhouse in Vegas. Very classy and all the food was awesome. We had the halibut and the filet and we were very pleased.
4,"The place to go when you need to see a cactus. Or hundreds of them, along with a variety of other desert plants. I went here with my digital camera and came back with a bunch of photos worth printing. The garden is extremely well-kept and is easily accessable. Admission is cut in half for students, so don't forget that ID card."
4,The pizza was hand tossed but the crust was perfectly crispy! The flavors were perfect too. I had the small which fed me (Im a big guy) but could have fed 2 people. I also had a 6 piece of hot wings which were very good! I would deffinately go back here again.
3,"The last review I read said Tram's has better atmosphere. Funny that I ended up at Pho Minh for the second time because Trams had kitchen violations and was shut down. Both times , the food was perfect. We started with the spring rolls, served cold with a nutty fish sauce - deelish. We then ordered the rice pancakes, which were loaded with shrimp and tofu. Lettuce cilantro and basil on the side, all fresh and graciously served. I tried spicy beef over lemongrass. The spice and citrus were a perfect combination. The portions are plentiful and all the entrees were priced under 9$. Highly recommended. One tip-they only take cash. Love this place and hope to add it to the regular rotation of Pgh dining!"
1,"I wish I hadn't grown up.\nBecause when I did...\nI went to this store which made regret ever being a Toys R Kid.\n\nThis Toys R Us could be used as the very reason why I do most of my shopping online.  The store is big and may have a huge selection, but it's woefully messy and unorganized.  And by messy I don't just mean stuff all over the place, I'm talking about dirty with cracked floor titles that are big enough to be tripped over.  I would say the store was hit by Grey Thursday/Black Friday tornado and never recovered, but it feels like it's always this way.  And it didn't take me too long to come to that conclusion.  That's because with the exception of the cashiers, I only saw three employees on the floor.  I know it was only friday in the mid-afternoon, but It's the holiday season.  How are there only three people available to help customers, restock shelves, and do any general cleaning in a store this big?\n\nUnless you have a child with you, I would avoid entering this Toys R Us at all cost.  Actually, for their safety, I would avoid bringing a child into this store, too."
2,"The place was ok. The burger ok. The fries ok. Not more, not less. \nA bit disappointed, but if you are downtown and need to eat in a fast and \""not really healthy\"" place, I would suggest O'Burger."
2,"The food is delicious and the portions are pretty generous. I ordered the sashimi plate expecting the pieces to be small, but they were fairly big and tasted pretty fresh. The tempura was not too battery and the salmon teriyaki was moist. \n\nBut, the service is a little slow. I don't understand why in some restaurants the servers walk around like they can't see the customers. This is one of those places. The servers would be standing next to us and not pay attention as we waved them down. 3 stars because of the service. And for some reason, the hostess likes to seat down customers and not give enough menus.\n\nThe all-you-can-eat doesn't seem worth it for $27 at dinner, but seems more worth it for $22 at lunch. I think most people can eat their fill for less than the dinner price. Plus it's not fair for them to state that they limit your time to 1 hour for dinner and 45 minutes for lunch for all-you-can-eat (although I don't think they really keep track of time). I would just come for the lunch time deal.\n\nI don't recommend the tempura ice cream if you didn't get the all-you-can-eat. It's a rip off for $3.50 because there's barely anything in the bowl. It's probably the only dish here that doesn't have a generous portion. You can finish the whole thing in just a few bites. Plus there wasn't much tempura. And there's only vanilla flavor."
1,NOTES:\n1. Overpriced\n2. Serves breakfast foods only\n3. Fast service - when it's not busy\n4. Food is alright\n5. Service is standard\n\nDon't get the HEALTHY START. I got that with Spinach and Smoked Salmon... and THEY COOKED THE SALMON! It's already smoked... why cook it so more... call it Fried Salmon then!  The omelet did not have ANY flavor. The brand muffin that came with it was good.\n\nAmbiance: It was there since I had a convention there. So it felt like a Denny's.\n\nThe Cafe Mocha was good. \n\nOverall... don't go here.
1,"ok flavors, but doesnt taste nearly as good as the froyo ive had in chicago.  Forever Yogurt on state street gets my vote!"
2,"Finally made it here, well I made it to Bill Spoon's BBQ - I ate in this building light years ago when it was Bubba's (of course, before it was Bubba's, it was Spoon's Barbecue - a certain symmetry exists even in the world of cooked pig.). Signs says \""We've cooked the whole pig since 1963\"", and if that is a collective \""We\"", then that is true.\n\nThey serve pretty solid Eastern NC barbecue here - they cook the whole pig till it is tender and juicy, moderately chop it & include some outside pieces, and lightly sauce it as served. What arrives at the table is fairly mild barbecue, and several large dashes of their sauce helps pick up the heat pace - this is a nice Eastern NC sauce.\n\nThe slaw is also very Eastern - mustard based with a little attitude, and goes great with the pork, and the BBQ Chicken, as well. The BBQ Chicken is nice and tender, but it is very mild, and benefits a great deal from a nice amount of salt, and some additional sauce, house or commercial hot sauce. The Combo Plate of  BBQ Chicken, 7 ounces of Chopped BBQ, and 2 sides goes for $14.75, not exactly cheap eats here. Chopped Sandwich is $5. The Hushpuppies here are very, very good.\n\nThe Chili Dog here is not one I'd order again - the chili lacks any kick, the onions go on last (just wrong), and at $2.50 this is an expensive wiener. The side of Onion Rings was actually nice - these are obviously frozen, but they were well fried, not over breaded, and had some good onion flavor. The FF were thin and crispy - nice. The Brunswick Stew ($4 for a small bowl) was simply awful - too thick and mushy (you cannot identify a single separate vegetable), and was very dark with a burnt, bitter taste. Your soda comes in a 12 ounce can, and there are no refills - cost is $2.\n\nThe service was quick, efficient, and friendly. They check on you several times during the meal. This is not destination barbecue in my opinion, but it is pretty good, especially for the Charlotte area. This is not a cheap place to eat barbecue, especially at the lunch meal. A BBQ Chicken/Pork Combo Plate with 2 sides, a small Brunswick Stew, a Chili Dog, an order of FF, and 2 Diet Cokes came to $27.10 before tax or tip. Too expensive for the combined quality and quantity."
4,Best. Ramen. In. Town. So authentic! Amazing atmosphere! Love it!
2,"We have a two years old daughter and we have been taking her with us to many many restaurants in town cuz we enjoy eating out. We always bring her own food since she has special diet need. No restaurant ever told us anything about bring our baby's own food except this one. \n\nWe were told bring own food is not allowed even for baby, needless to say, we were upset and that would be our last time visiting there.\n\nThis restaurant is the most kid unfriendly restaurant."
4,"I could begin by raving about the viking warrior of a bartender who mans the helm, sending your drink of choice your way with a sincere and quietly engaging, \""Here you go, brother\"" and who, when not cashing out each drink order in turn, always makes up the check at night's end fairly and utterly lacking in calculated mathematics.  It is what it is, after all and there's never a need to debate figures after a few cold ones.  \n\nBut the beauty of this place, in short, is it's complete lack of snark and irony.  There is no ironic winking at or poking at one's preferences -- all that seems to matter is that a person HAS preferences.  It is a genuine place in all of the best ways: the decor, food, beers, staff, music, etc.  \n\nOne of many examples of this that I can think of is from this past winter, during the playoffs.  It was not a meaningful game, with the Steelers being out of contention, but there was nevertheless a fairly attentive football crowd for the late game/matchup.  Anyway... once the game ended around 11ish, the amazingly well-curated jukebox came on (filled with favorite A-sides and endlessly surprising deeper cuts), perfect wings and pirogies kept flowing from the kitchen, and the aforementioned viking warrior of a bartender switched it over the Turner Classic Movies (TCM).\n\nI've no idea what was on; I think it was just a series of old-timey commercials or a lesser known movie from the 40's, but the same football-watching crowd just seemed to watch the black and white characters without comment, puzzlement, or as if the change marked some sort of shift in the evening.  It just was and people noticed and we liked it.  \n\nIt was a good night."
3,"I'd go here again, they were really sweet. \nI got a gel manicure and they only charged me $20, plus $5 for two pop up bows. \n\nI had Amy, she took her time and did exactly what I wanted. \n\nThe only problem was when trying to put on my bow the glue dried quickly in an awkward position and she couldn't get my bow off. She had to rip it off and along with the bow came my gel. So she asked another person to do it. \n\nThe other person did not take his time at all, there is gel on my finger and some bumps. (It was after closing time, so I think he wanted to go home.) He didn't care how it looked. \n\nWhen I go back there I will personally be asking for Amy. And not him."
3,"We ate a breakfast and lunch here. The food is very good. I had the mushroom soup and a panini and it was tasty. It was a little too much food. The cafe latte and croissants were great. I would definitely stop here again. It is very busy on the weekends, but the wait was worth it."
0,"Where do i begin?  Well, I had set up the reservation 2 months in advance for our group of 15.  Having read the reviews, I was really looking forward to this meal, as this was one of the main events of our trip.  Now it takes a lot for a steak house to really impress me, but it takes an equally bad experience for me to absolutely regret going....and this was that experience.  \n\nThey were running a little behind when we arrived, so we had a cocktail at the bar.  Every 10 minutes or so, i would check in with the hostess, who perpetually informed me it would be 2 more minutes.  After 40 patient and polite minutes on my end, I finally demanded to speak to the manager.  He could not have cared less about our wait, was quite rude, and made it clear that he didn't have time to speak with me.  Within 10 minutes, they seated us in the 2nd private room upstairs.  It was a nice gesture, but thats where the pleasantness ended.  They had two different sized round tables, which totally ruined our ability to enjoy dinner as a group. We were told there would be bread waiting for us since we were all starving.  LIE.  \n\nIt took 15 minutes for the waiter to get our drink orders.  Then a few minutes later, his assistant came by and asked us for a drinks, we told him that we'd already ordered our drinks, but would like to order some appetizers.  He simply walked away from us.  They then left us for about 25 minutes while they tended to the other private party.  Apparently we were not worth their time.\n\nAfter an hour, we finally received our appetizers, and soon after that, got our dinner.  The steaks were ok.  Whole Foods quality beef at best, and the char on them held the flavor of the fuel(gas??) that cooked the steaks.  The ribeye simply wasn't cooked properly, as the fat was not melted enough, making the mouthfeel terribly unpleasant.  The sides came slowly after the steaks.  The \""family style\"" fries were large enough to feed a family of 1.  And they also missed a side as well.  \n\nFor dessert, many of us simply opted for a coffee.  Safe bet for a quick ending, right?  Wrong.  Half of us asked for regular coffee, the other half ordered coffee with liquor.  The regular coffees came up about 10 minutes before the other ones.  When they were brought up, the waiter goes \""who ordered the regular coffee?\""  Our response was simply \""The ones who ordered the regular coffee\"".  As the Captain of a Waitstaff of a \""high quality\"" steakhouse, how do you not know that?  Thats what you get asked in applebees.\n\nBottom line: The food was not dreadful at best, considering the $2500 tab.  The service was probably the worst i've ever experienced at a restaurant of that caliber.  From start to finish, our experience was one i don't wish on any diner.  Their treatment of us gave the impression that they didn't care because we were Americans.  The sad part is we were all looking forward to this meal.  I don't regret trying the place, but i do regret tipping them at all.  They didn't deserve anything.  There's a difference between having an off night, and simply being bad.  There are plenty of steak houses in Montreal, so if you're gonna spend the money, DON'T GO TO QUEUE DE CHEVAL!"
2,"Yet another place that I had high hopes for that didn't even come close.  We checked out Vitamin T today finally after I had been waiting for months, hearing tacos, tequilas, and MEXICAN STREET FOOD...what could be more up my alley???\n\nOn a sunday afternoon, it was relatively full.  We grabbed the last spot on the patio and headed in to order up at the counter.  Dos Equis on tap?  Hell yeah.  I decided to go for the veggie caramelos, which I was told were like mini vegetable quesadillas, and come two to an order.  Sweet Pea surprisingly didn't go for the Sonoran dog, which is one of his favorite things in life, but rather a beef torta (sandwich) of some sort.  We also got some chips and guac.\n\nAs we waited for our order, I filled up a line of cups with every salsa at the bar, and we proceeded to sample being the salsa fiends we are.  They were all just OK.  Nothing really hot, or even somewhat hot.  One was too vinegary for me, one was too smoky for him, and then there were a couple that were just all right.  My caramelos were pretty much as advertised, except where was the queso in the quesadilla??  They were small corn tortillas with a kind of bland, soggy  vegetable mixture and a tiny bit of cheese.  Nothing I'd order again.  \n\nSweet Pea's torta looked fantastic.  It was a huge sandwich, lots of stuff in it, and a giant roll.  He had trouble maneuvering to eat it, and given the taste, he said that it just wasn't worth the effort.  The chips were also totally disappointing.  They may actually be the first tortilla chips that I didn't finish.  They were disgustingly greasy.  I mean not just some dots on the paper bag they came in, the entire bag was transparent with grease, and the chips still were slick and practically dripped.  The guac was nondesript.\n\nOne more thing- if you put \""tequila\"" in your name and signs, you really need to have more than 3 tequilas, all of which are Don Julio.  People, we live in Arizona.  Dive bars have a better selection.  Come on Vitamin T, you can do better."
3,"Nice spot.\n\nCan't really complain about this chain - great service and solid food.  Showed up here before closing for a some quick grub before knocking out at home.  Had the chicken lettuce wraps and hot'n'sour soup.  Admittedly, I was quite inebriated - the food was great.  \n\nThe best \""chinese\"" food I've had in Charlotte thus far...\n\ndmo out"
2,"This Zoo is okay. Bring lots of money because it will cost you 73 dollars for 2 adults and one kid over 2 and then all the ride.  The exhibits were a little lacking in the zoo side of things but the aquarium was pretty nice, especially considering it was in Arizona.  The boat ride and the carrasel were closed which was a bummer but the train and log flume were open.  Each ride costs money on top of admission and they only take cash.  Additionally the snack bar only takes cash as well so be ready for that.  \n\nThe highlights for my kids was the petting zoo, the train ride, log flume and feeding the stingrays.  A good place to take your kids but be ready to drop some serious money here.  After ridding the rides, eating at the snack bar, admission, and the gift shop I dropped about 250$."
2,"I've been here a few times.  The service is good.  The side items are great.  But the last two occasions I went there the fish was just average.\n\nThe prices are a little high for similar restaurants, but, if you need seafood and are at Tempe Marketplace, it's not a bad option."
0,"ATTENTION- SEE BELOW. BUT I WANT THIS 1 STAR BACK!\n\nI have eaten at this establishment quite a few times over the years ever since they opened. I would have breakfast meetings here, take the girls softball team here after games and other events. We thought it was a good place to suggest 3 of my friends join me last night. after a long day of diving over 900 miles in one shot and loading and off loading a 25 foot moving truck, we wanted a change from the spots along the highway.\n\nMy first impression when we walked in the door was it smelled like a greasy sewer. I headed to the rest room to wash my hands. It was gross and the rest room was even worse. I even noticed little deodorizers like the ones in the urinals in some unusual places outside the restroom. Humm. Makes you wonder!\n\nWe sat and waited for others to join us. We were parked in the second to the east corner booth, by the kitchen door and milk shake machine. We were hungry and tired. Once our party joined us, we ordered.  It was not a complex or difficult order.... 3 french toast orders and I had small diner salad, half tuna and soup of the day. \n\nThe place was far from busy and most other patrons were already eating. It took every bit of 25 minutes or more to get our food. The server Mike (receipt said a different foreign name)  had no clue how to serve, never brought us our utensils, forgetting parts of the order. \n\nBut the part I am really complaining and disgusted about and warning to others has to deal with what we all witnessed crawling all around us.\n\n First, while we were waiting for our food, I watched a roach, yes roach, la cucaracha, crawl on the wall under the counter bar where you can sit. He cruised all around there. Several in our party were somewhat grossed out. Still waiting on our food, a second person in our party notices another one on the floor under the table (booth) adjacent to us where a nice family of 5 were sitting. We did not want to start a panic and said nothing. Ok, this is getting a bit freaky. Then, just before our food came, the more squeamish in our group of us male outdoorsmen, sees a third one behind me, crawling up the wall. That did it. Several told the waiter to return the food to the kitchen and get the manager while the others 2 ate with reluctance.  \n\nBottom line, if you want a marginal meal served in a piss poor manner in a smelly environment, with a triple side of roaches, you got to try this place. By the way,  we were compt our meal and tipped our server a little something but this place has lost what amounts to or will amount to 50 patrons. adios la cucarachas!"
1,This review is generous after what happened today. This place is great if\nyou're going to get the tea service (best scones) but the regular food leaves something to be desired. The pork belly was severely undercooked leaving layers of raw rubbery fat. Both of my parents entrees had to be returned bc they were stone cold. My mother's food took a full 20 to refire and my father and I finished eating by the time her food came. Not to mention the waiter said the chef checked the food and it was fine. Bad move buddy. Rude. The service is PAINFULLY slow. I know it is short staffed but it's ridiculous. I usually don't mind the slow service bc the tea and scones are superb but I'm going to have a hard time coming back. So disappointing.\n\nPS - they didn't even want to make it right! They offered my mom a drink AFTER we were done with dinner! Such bad business. I work in customer service. You always take care of the customer.
2,"I recently had the choice of sitting home in an empty apartment (my stuff was being shipped from Miami) or hitting up the FREMONT for the .99 Cent Margaritas...\n\nI opted for the margaritas!! THEY win everytime!!\n\nNext time lets skip the \""\""Tea Party Bullshit\"" = order 5 & have them put it in a large glass & order a tequila floater to top it off. NOW You're talking!!\n\nThen again, some of you might like having a little tea party. I DONT!!...ALOT of interesting characters wandering around & watch out for the elderly in their souped up electric wheel chair as they WILL do a \""Hit-n-Run\"" on your ass & not even flinch (because they probably NEVER saw you in the begin with!!).... You've been warned!!\n\nAlso I might add that the old grey haired bartenders are quite CREEPY!! It doesnt help at all that they have NO PERSONALITIES & wear these \""Barber-like\"" smocks & have on 1 plastic glove like they want to give you a FREE prostate exam!! My advice is just drink that much more .99 margaritas & think about \""butterflys in wide-open feilds\""... OR SOMETHING!! Try to ignore them & NOT think about it!!"
2,"I like this location because they have a drive-thru. Even though there is almost always a long line, they get you on your way fast. The staff is friendly and competent. Also, they rarely run out of anything (other locations seem to go through their entire inventory of breakfast sandwiches and scones by 9am).\n\nIf you are the type that does not drink your morning coffee inside a moving vehicle, they also have comfy chairs inside and decent patio seating.  The patio faces the parking lot and drive-thru but it does have shade umbrellas so it can be very pleasant in the morning."
2,"I am a formal/dress clothes aficionado and shop around a lot, and see a lot of different environments for these types of stores. This Mens Wearhouse still reigns in my top for service. Unfortunately though I do not believe in the company anymore as my wedding was April 12th 2013 (this year) and they dropped my reservations for my best man and grooms man at the Arrowhead location and almost messed my wedding up. Luckily working in retail I know customer care would solve it and the customer care team got it to me on time. That was too close of a call to be comfortable in store anymore. Plus the prices even on there BOGO events that they repeatedly do, if you find the cycles on the better stores (Nordstrom's, Dillard's) you can catch the same price for better quality clothing. Pricey for the quality."
4,"Yes, it's all true what's been said about Jennifer. She is THAT fantastic and definitely knows skincare. I've had two treatments done with her and am looking forward to going back to her on a regular basis. I have finally found my official esthetician. Her prices are reasonable, her treatments work (none of that extra fruffy stuff I don't need), and best of all she's not a product pusher. Though with her wealth of knowledge on skin care products, I couldn't help but ask her opinion on things. I love that she gives me honest answers about skin care lines. \n\nBasically, if you're looking for an honest person who will help you achieve great results with your skin, go see Jennifer. I'm so glad that she's here in the valley!"
2,"In honor of today's ROTD , i convinced my daughter and sis to join me for dinner at Shuseki.  Overall, I liked it.  with limited exception, I tried everything Teri had except the takowasabi and the sashimi salad.  Did try one of the spicy ramen bowls - really liked the broth - the noodles, hmmm, can you say, TOP RAMEN\n\nsadly, had to knock it down one star because the salmon sashimi my daughter ordered was partially frozen !   Admittedly, i tried to convince her to avoid the sushi since my sense was this is not a place to go for the sushi.\n\nshould also knock it down a slight notch because the bacon wrapped asparagus was a disappointment ( raku is on a totally different level with this dish )  \n\nIt feels like a larger version of  Ichiza - larger place and larger menu.  \n\nIt's worth a 2nd visit to try some of the other items."
4,"I absolutely LOVE this studio!!!  I tried the location in old town first and instantly became addicted. I was counting down the days for the North Scottsdale location to open since this one is much closer to home.  All of the instructors are very well trained and make the class so enjoyable.  They all make a point to know your name, help with correcting if form is off, play upbeat music.....they really have built a very nice family unit.  They also create fun challenges with prizes to win....even better incentive to get your body moving and shaking.  This is the first studio that I have ever joined that created incentives like this before.  Also, think its awesome they offer the first class free....dont know of any other studio that does this either.  In addition, I have noticed a huge change in my body as well.  I used to hike and do pilates all the time and after joining Karve, my body became leaner, burning more fat and used muscles I didnt even know I had.  I highly recommend if you are looking to shed some fat, tone some muscles and/or simply just want to try something new."
1,"This was the first hotel I stayed in Vegas, and of course at the time I liked it (I didnt know any better), now that time has passed I can say that I really dont like the place (sorry) the area where it is sucks, I take a Downtown Hotel any time, and sometimes they are even cheaper. Oh and dont even get me started on the buffet, it made the person who was with me really sick."
1,"I wonder if this place is supposed to be like the \""dive bar\"" version of Hooters?  I'm reading all of these reviews plus knowing this place is a corporate chain (one need only enter their gift shop to see that) and I'm feeling it is.  My mom and I were there long enough to buy one beer and drink it down last Friday night before taking in the stomp stylings of the bikini-topped bartenders.  The place was way too loud and obnoxious for there only being about 15 people (this includes the staff).  Then there was some guy sitting on a chair at the front of what appeared to be a stage and all I could think to myself was, \""is he the grand wizard?\"" I wondered if they were having their Klan meeting there that night.  The blaring southern classic rock and hillbilly music is really not my thing per se.  I mean, it's great every once in awhile to get your white trash on, but that's why I go to NASCAR races.  \n\nAs far as \""dive bars\"" go, it's so not.  I am interested in knowing how they price their tall boys of PBR though.  If they're $7, Toto we're definitely in corporate hipster wannabe territory.  Ick!"
3,"While still great, Luxor isn't the amazing Egyptian place that I remember it as.  It seems to have been stripped a bit of its theme and leans more towards a \""normal\"" hotel-casino than an ancient Egyptian oasis.\n\nStill, it's a nice place to come.  I've heard that the nightlife is quite fun there.  The arcade managed to provide a lot of entertainment, although everything seemed to close down a bit early for a Vegas weekend, which seemed very odd to be considering the high profile nature of this casino."
2,"I tried Pita Jungle for the first time and I am deeply disappointed that I was not greeted with: \n\n\""Welcome to the jungle.\""\n\nWhat a missed opportunity! Seriously!\n\nI found the food to be pretty OK, not outstanding.  I had the chicken schwarma (aka Mediterranean chicken wrap on the menu) and it was no schwarma from Al Hana at Biaz Market, my friend.\n\nThe chicken was plentiful, and cubed. The lettuce was fresh and plentiful.  The sauce was some kind of garlicky-tahini-hummus tasting concoction that was fine.  The portion was just fair for the nearly 8 dollar price tag.\n\nMy server Valerie was a real treat so I would rate the service as 4 star even though that doesn't seem to jive with other reviews."
1,"I really love getting smoothies and checking out small smoothie shops but I was a little disappointed with this one. \n\nMy smoothie was bland, tasted mostly like the soy milk ingredient, and I noticed that all the smoothie are juice and sherbet based and don't actually have fresh fruit in them. bummer.\n\nI tried the acai smoothie, which had acai juice, raspberry juice, sherbet, and soymilk in it and it was ok. \n\nThese smoothies need fresh fruit ingredients!"
1,"After waiting for 20 minutes while the Manager (I assume) walked around without helping anyone, we were finally asked if we wanted something from the humidor.  We chose, and went to bar to get drinks.  This took another 15 at least.  \nThe girl bartending had no clue what she was doing.  2 other customers at bar.  pretty shameful display.\nGot a cigar and beer combo as advertised to make it easy.   There were 6 of us, 3 with cigars.\nWent outside to smoke.  Nice atmosphere.  Sports on.  Lots of fun.  Beer and cigars in Vegas.  No complaints here.\n\nWent by later at night, super loud house music, younger crowd...turned into a place I would NEVER want to smoke a cigar in.\n\nMixed review.  Worse than bad service, dry overpriced cigar.  Cool daytime atmoshphere, comfortable.  I expect the cigar to cost too much so that is a warning, more than a criticism."
0,"Yeah, methinks not. Vanity isn't even big and it's not even that nice. We came with a party of about 20 on a Sunday and the guys had to pay $40/each for cover charge. The drinks at the bar were more expensive than any other club in Vegas that I have been to--$20/shot. The music was sub par and the crowd was predominantly Caucasians. It was actually pretty dead, so I left after about an hour. I can careless about the decor and it's location. Customer service will make it or break it for me and the customer service here was terrible. The staff was bias and judgmental. They didn't give anyone else a hard time, except for us. Whatever, I won't be coming here again."
1,I only give this place 2 stars because the staff was great.  The food looks amazing but that's all. The flavor just wasn't there.  My husband's pork looked like over cooked bacon slabs. I paid extra for shrimp and scallops which were both rubbery in texture and totally tasteless.  Save your money and try someplace else if you're wanting Thai food in Vegas.
3,The service was great! I liked the cheese and meat platter we ordered. The main courses were fairly good but pricey.
0,No working bathrooms. No bueno :(
0,This place has terrible service. Their sales team tells you exactly what you want to hear and then it all falls apart from there. I purchased a couch/love seat/3 table combo set from them and told them I needed it delivered on a very specific date. The date I needed the items delivered was about 3 weeks away from the date I was in the store and the salesman guaranteed me that I would have them at the needed time. The day before delivery was scheduled I called to confirm and check delivery time just to find out they didn't have a single piece of the combo I purchased and that there would be multiple deliveries for seperate pieces. When I asked what could be done to compensate me for my trouble they told me they could give me $100 store credit or $50 returned to my card. First...why would you offer store credit to someone that has repeatedly voiced his frustration with your company and its services? And second...that $50 doesn't even cover the delivery fee that they screwed up on. Terrible customer service all around. I will never shop here again and I recommend you take the multiple terrible reviews they have in to consideration before stepping foot in their stores.
3,Pretty cool Vegas show! \n\nI don't want to give away much of the show but this guy is borderline scary. He can get in your head and guess what you are thinking about. \n\nThe theater didn't seem very big and Gerry interacts with the crowd throughout the show. Great for families as well.\n\nMy only tip is that if you don't buy the VIP seats show up about 40-45 min early to snag a good seat for the show. It is worth it.
2,"I've been here twice now. Once tonight and once they originally changed owners and names.\n\nToday started off well. They brought some complimentary fried bananas and some other root veggie. I thought they were really good. Reminded me of being a kid.\n\nTonight we tried a medium yellow chicken curry with white rice, beef pad se ewe, Issan sausage, and their combination rice bowl.\n\nAside from the free fried bananas the only thing I actually liked was the curry. The only complaint was the onions and carrots weren't cooked enough. The carrots were in huge chunks so they weren't soft. The flavor was really good and I would come back for this. Super flavorful! \n\nThe noodles I thought didn't have much flavor and the beef was kind of tough/chewy. \n\nThe worst part of dinner were the sausages. They had way too much rice in them. There was barely any actually discernible meat. I was really disappointed.\n\nAfter the first visit and the eh service both times I don't know if I'd ever rush to go back. I only did because my friend said the curry and Tom kha gai was still good. I'm not sure if their server had any experience in other establishments but they need to fix that."
3,"$20 or $25 cover for guys on a Friday night.\n\nThe view is nice of the strip, unlike anything else I've seen in the 10 or so times I have been out to Vegas. \n\nOur downfall was definitely ordering the Witches Brew without sharing (I guess there is a reason it comes with 4 straws). Each of these were about $30 but needless to say, you are set for the night if you drink it. Can't say with confidence I would subject myself to the same torture again, this thing isn't tasty at all.\n\nThere were a couple of dance floor in the place. Can't say I was super fond of the music being played or the crowd, but really, enough alcohol can make any place enjoyable."
4,"As an organized freak, this store is the bestest with the mostest!  To organize anything, they have got it.  Just walking thru gives me ideas to neatin up my life!!"
0,"Horrible family memory won't be forgotten soon enough!!\nWe went on ride with our 5 year old and his best friend's family.\nUnfortunately we shared the ride with older couple and their middle aged son.\nBrief acknowledgment from the older couple that our two 5 year olds were normal rambunctious excitement would be welcomed. However their middle aged son decided to have an episode halfway through the ride and literally yell at our 5 year old son to calm down. As any father would I got between him and my son and he did not calm down and continued profanities. I went on defense mode protecting my family from this clearly unstable individual who happened to be carrying a knife visible on \nhis belt. I pleaded with his elder parents to intervene and reason with their son as clearly this would escalate into a physical altercation. At that point they managed to bring him down but both my son and his best friend both in the clutches of their distraught mothers were clearly beyond having any experience other than us calming them and hoping that they will be ok. They were not ok. The ride ended and upon departure the elder couple and their Middle aged son bee lined for the exit. I got together with the other disturbed father and we went to get security to stop this maniac and get him to apologize. NO SECURITY IN SITE!!! I stopped the maniac and yelled for security to help with the situation. NO SECURITY IN SITE!!! These people walked out the door and I continued to yell for help. NO SECURITY IN SITE!!! Finally a Manager came out and wanted me to calm down \""not to interfere with anyone's positive experience\"". So I managed to calm down and after clearly explaining our horrible experience he offered nothing but a simple sorry. That is the best way to describe their security and customer care....SORRY.\n\nFunny thing is there is a sign on their front door with a picture of a gun with a line through it...what about a maniac and a knife \n\nProceed with caution"
1,I was sadly disappointed with this place. I had the chicken chow mein and it had way too much teriyaki sauce. I felt crappy afterwards too. For the price I expected it to be much better. There are better Chinese restaurants in the area that are half the price and much tastier.
2,"Good jukebox selection, but the tables here have seen better days."
1,"Airport? More like struggle bus. \n\nIt's a struggle to go from one terminal to the next. \nIt's a struggle to keep your nose closed (it's quite stinky.)\nIt's a struggle to find charging outlets.\nAnd, quite frankly, it's a struggle to even look at.\nThe bathrooms = struggle.\nYa, there are loud slot machines. Ya, there's an Einstein Bagel. Ya, I try to avoid layovers here! Talk to my husband who is currently playing the Wheel of Fortune slot machine later. If he wins some of dat cash money, I might bump to 3 stars."
2,"I've been here a few times for Spring Training. The facility is nice enough but seems a bit dated. The seating is not the most comfortable but I have to say that the last game I took in here was awesome because we got seats not too far behind home plate in the upper section....but the best part was the it was beneath the announcer's booth  and in the shade which was GREAT considering that I failed to bring sunscreen.\nThe concessions here are a bit limited and while I have nothing to complain about, compared to the other venues I've hit, Peoria is probably my least favorite."
2,"The Dowd has great facilities, large locker rooms complete with Steam and Sauna facilities, every fitness class you can think of, basketball courts, a pool...\n\nIt's the ideal place to go to stay fit.\n\nThe one drawback is that it's not without some sketchy activity.  Recently, I was changing after a workout, and I saw these two guys walking around the locker room.  I didn't think much of it, but someone who was changing beside me said,\n\""Hey - what are you two doing?\""\n\""Nothin man, we're waitin for ****\""\n\""I see you casin' the place, I left for a shower you were walkin around, I get back from my shower, you still walkin around\""\n\""No man, we're just waitin for ****\""\n\nSo the guy who is calling these two sketchy dudes out walks over to the emergency phone, picks it up and calls the front desk.\n\nThe two sketchy dudes, are acting all tough and cool about it, but literally proceed to walk out of the locker room, up the stairs and out of the building.  \n\nI happened to finish up around that same time, and walked out about a minute after them.  I saw them get into their car and drive off - so much for waiting for their \""friend\""!\n\nAs I'm watching them leave, another guy who left at the same time as me and was headed home or to work or something says to me,\n\n\""I can't believe it - they were definitely here looking to get into people's lockers\""\n\""Yea, definitely, I'm surprised\"", I reply\nThe guy says to me \""I actually had my locker broken into here not too long ago, my wallet was stolen...\""\n\nThe moral of the story is this - either bring a freakin masterlock with you, or don't change at the gym and just enjoy the facilities!\n\nOh and one more thing - for the money?  the Y charges you based on your income, so if you make decent money, you'll spend $100 a month for 2 people.  That to me is a bit on the pricey side..."
0,"I've been to the Old Fashioned several times - dinner and lunch. Very fun menu and a creative, fresh take on the supper club theme. I would definitely skip the lunch - they have a very chaotic process for ordering. You are seated, and then have to order food and pay at the bar. When I went last week for lunch, we were initially seated at a window table, which would have been great if it hadn't been for about 10 flies flying around. Gross. We asked to be moved. We placed our order and paid at the bar and waited. And waited. And waited. Ultimately, we waited for an hour and a half for our food, which was medicore when it finally came. Turns out that the computer system went down shortly after they placed our order (and a few other patrons' orders) and they couldn't produce the food. However, they never came to tell us this, we had to seek them out after about 45 minutes. They never offered us appetizers or complimentary drinks. And, to top it off, people who were seated 45 minutes after us got their food before us and we got to enjoy watching them eat while our stomachs growled. Eventually, they decided to take our order again manually and the food arrived. It was frustrating because we had paid for everything up front, including the tip. I had to ask for a refund. When it came, it wasn't a full refund, but I didn't have the energy to try and point that out to them. Suffice it to say, it's unlikely I will go back."
3,Went here today for lunch with work pals and got the pud khing sod with seafood and it was delicious. The lunches start with a light miso tofu soup and the main dish comes with rice and a spring roll. Love the hot sauce selection. The service is super speedy; small place so it's tight in there. Will try the pad Thai next. That's what everyone typically gets here because  it's so good.
4,"I think that from the previous reviews this bike shop has gotten a bad rap.  I, from reading the comments, was hesitant on going to the shop but was interested in Specialized bike and being a beginner/entry level rider had lots of questions.  I decided I'd give them a try.  I went in and seen lots of different bikes and was somewhat overwhelmed.  I was approached after a few minutes and asked if I needed any help or had any questions.  Boy, this young man didn't know I had a million questions. He was very happy and patient and answered all of my questions and even offered up several different bikes, and not the more expensive ones, but ones that would fit my budget.  He was more than happy to talk to me about the bikes and increased my knowledge of the road bike arena.  I asked for his business card and told him I'd call again and stop by next week.\nWell, the bike that I wanted was there and was reduced in price, but having to work all weekend and all day long, I wasn't able to get to the shop during shop hours.  I did call them and asked several more questions and the gentlemen that I spoke with this time were just as helpful, patient and courteous.  I'm convinced that if they treat me this way when I'm looking and haven't bought yet, than I'm really feeling confident that the customer service will be just as great.\nI think that you are doing a injustice to yourself and the business if you don't afford them the opportunity to earn your business."
3,"I gave this four stars because I found their concession stand prices outrageous, but the ticket cost was great. The quality of the movie was great, and the whole experience was great. Totally worth the nostalgia."
0,"Horrible HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Zero stars across the board for service. How can such a place stay in business this long with such aweful service?? Don't get me wrong the restaurant downstairs was amazing the best tacos i've ever had and the wait staff was great but the hotel staff themselves were beyond rude. It started at Check-in when the very unprofessional concierge was explaining certain rules and stating how \""stupid\"" guests are by thinking if they open something or break something the hotel wont track them down and charge them double. The WORST WORSTTTTT part was one exhausting evening we arrived back from a friend's wedding to find our room wasn't cleaned and there was this gross disgusting smelly dirty rag on our coffee table till this day \""no one\"" knows how it got there. I called the front desk to complain and I was treated like a god aweful criminal that apparently travels around with dirty rags in my bag and leaves them in hotel rooms. The concierge I believe his name was Denny, made it seem like it was all of our fault and that the hotel could do no wrong. On top of what I would call..hmm whats the complete OPPOSITE of great service?? He offered to clean our room himself which in it's self was extremely creepy. He became very defensive and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I packed my bags and left. We stay at the PALOMAR btw and that my friends is what I call great service."
4,"Easy review to write. Definite 5 stars from service to selection. Seriously, you can't go wrong with this shop. I appreciate the deals too!"
2,Not bad pizza.... Service is below par
4,"This place is the bomb! Please do not let the exterior fool you. It may not be in the best area but man is the food great. Having been to Thailand many times, I can atest to this being authentic Thai. Portions sizes are decent and the price is great compared to other Thai places. Service is excellent, although there is only one waitress. Lunch gets very busy as many people on base like to dine here. Try and avoid 12-2pm is you can. Wish they were open later than 6pm, but I guess since it is a mom and pop business they can't be there all day. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed!"
0,This McDonald's is really bad. They don't even open the play place until almost 11 am even though there are like 10 kids waiting. The manager said she doesn't know when they open. They rang up my order wrong and took forever to figure it out. The dining areas are dirty. What the heck is wrong with this place?!
1,"Walked here after having dinner at Liberty Market, since I couldn't have any of the desserts offered there.  After the friendly and very helpful female host helped to phone the pastry chef to address my food allergies, I placed my order of a slice of \""Dangerous Dilemma\"" and a chocolate-covered walnut strudel and was seated at a two-top next to a window with a view of a parking lot.  I decided to while away the wait on the dessert by looking at the baubles on display by the entrance.  A few moments later, the host notified me that the strudel had cornstarch, so it's a no-no for me, and that  I would not be able to dine inside since I should not have been seated with an \""outside drink.\""  \""Would this be a problem?,\"" she asked. I said no, paid for my to-go dessert, and settled on a bench outside the cafe.  While the two forkfuls that I tried of the multi-layered dense cake (cookie crumb bottom layer, dark chocolate fudge cake, white chocolate mousse, another layer of dark chocolate fudge cake, and then topped with raspberry coulis) were delicious, I inadvertently became the meal of ghost mosquitoes (so I had to pack up and leave, yet again).  All because I had a lidded to-go cup of Liberty Market drip house coffee with me.\nThe $6.54 (tax included) cake slice was tasty (although almost a bit too sweet), and I can't fault someone for following house rules, but I wished my drink could've been overlooked.  (There were only two occupied tables out of 12 to 15 tables.) Heck, I could've ordered a glass of wine, or another cup of coffee, with my dessert had I not been turned away..."
2,"The hubs and I stayed here four years ago, back when we could still call ourselves tourists, and The Plaza was a straight up dump.  Twelve seasons and thirty five million dollars later it's more like a butter face girl with a mall department store cosmetic counter make over.  Sure it looks better, but you can still tell under all the frills it's might not be something you want.  There is a strange mix of old and new in here and you can point out right away what has been there for a while.  \n\nI'll start with the old.  Thirty year old chandeliers stick out in a otherwise completely redone elevator vestibule.  Painted doors and hinges that stick in their frames next to poorly placed designer wallpaper.  Tiny bathtubs sit with shiny new faucets and tile.  Light switches and plates stained yellow from decades of smoke pop out from an almost completely renovated room.  There was a threadbare blanket tucked neatly between two new sheets instead of a comforter on the bed.  In the sports book you could walk between the new carpet of the casino that is a gray blend with red flowers to the old green carpet with shapes printed into it.  The buffet is now a sushi place, the layout is pretty much the same, but instead of the buffet line you have the sushi counter, but they kept the silverware.  Even the casino has mix of old barely working poker machines sitting pretty with shiny new reel games with fancy bonuses.  The worst of the old, the parking garage.  It looks like any day it could crumble to bits.\n\nThe new fabulous things are choices.  They have a sushi place, coffee joint, A Hash House a go go, a cupcake stop, Subway, a McDonalds opening soon and of course Oscar's steak house which will be arriving shortly.  There is an Italian place that is so poorly advertised that I can't be sure if it's open yet either.  Another thing that was missing those four years ago; ROOM SERVICE!!!  Yeah, it's probably not that great and is not twenty four hours but it's another choice.  They also house the only bingo joint in downtown.  Check in has moved from the second floor to a small spot right inside the domed area.  It kind of sucks having to walk from the garage all the way through the casino and then back to the tower with luggage in hand.  It would really accommodate someone who is being dropped of by taxi though.  The parking garage isn't in the best of shape, and being downtown, where you can walk anywhere you need to get to, one may not even need to rent a car if you choose to stay here.   \n\nOverall the experience was a good one.  The rooms are still missing a few things like a remote, hair dryer, chairs for the desk and some decorative pillows.  I wish there was a extra pillows or a blanket for the bed as it did get cold overnight.  The room was basically clean and we got a great deal for the night at twenty eight dollars on expedia.com.  I have booked another stay for a friend and I as a girls' night out for a weekend rate of ninety five bucks so you can see there is a big swing in the rates.  I think the best deals are through their own website, but only if you are booking at least a two day stay.  With plenty of dining options and tons to do on Fremont street, the Plaza is a great anchor to spend your vacation checking out the cool side of town."
3,"gorgeous gorgeous nightclub located in the Wynn hotel .... \nbe sure to get on the guest list --\nbe prepared to pay lots of cash for drinks...  like all clubs in Vegas -- \nthe music --- started off very top 40 ish -- then became more progressive House...\nI think....\nnights in Vegas are sort of a blur... you know!  \n\nat the end of the day -- as far as music and crowd.... all clubs in Vegas are somewhat the same...\nI did enjoy  Tao, XS and Marquee  -- a tad bit better than Tryst... \nfor a complete Vegas club experience -- be sure to visit at least one or all of the above!"
0,This place is so disorganized. Went to exchange some coffee mugs and the lady was so confused. They could not read there own receipt. All I wanted to do is exchange coffee mugs for a different color. Same price. But they claimed there was a $0.03 deference. I paid it just because I wanted to get out of there! I will do all I can to talk my friends and family from shopping here.
4,"I really enjoyed my dining experience here there is no better way to have dinner at sunset in Las Vegas with a rotating dining floor and seeing the spectacular views on a 360* scale! Service was on point, food cooked and served to perfection and delicious! Fun romantic ambience! Will most definitely return!"
4,"Delicious!! Had chicken, waffles, mac n cheese, greens, and cornbread. I'm stuffed. Excellent friendly service!!"
4,Been here a few times with friends and we got beyond drunk and turnt up !! LOL the mike Tyson punchout is delicious!
3,Good sushi.loved the lobster mango roll. They need a happy hour special. Huge menu if you're not into sushi. Don't get the tacos the shells are awful. Great ocean salad
2,"This tavern is great. You can choose between having a full meal or just snacking on bar food and the bar is full service. You can also choose between sitting in the main bar area (smoking) or sitting in the dining area (non-smoking). That is the only complaint that I do have. I would like to go and hang out in the bar area and play pool but it is constantly saturated with cigarette smoke. So I am banished to the smaller area with no recreational activities. Not really a place to go have a few drinks if your not really a smoker. \n\nI will be coming back to eat, but not to party."
0,"A couple months ago, I purchased a LivingSocial deal (that appeared to be the exact same as this Groupon deal) for an eye exam and $50 credit towards contacts or $150 towards. I had the eye exam, but then the company refused to give me $50) towards contacts UNLESS I PURCHASED A YEARS WORTH OF CONTACTS.....which isnt stated ANYWHERE on the Groupon, including the fine print, which I carefully read!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI called idoc, and spoke with two people, including a man named Ernest, who told me that the company couldnt make money if they gave me $50 bucks towards the amount of contacts I wanted to buy. Essentially, he told me I had to buy a years supply of contacts if I wanted the credit, according to him and the polite young lady I spoke to prior to him, who had told me the exact same info Earnest had. I will give them that: they were both polite.\n\nBut hey, polite or not, I still expected and deserved my $50 contact credit, so I pressed on: I told Earnest that IDoc set up their own LivingSocial deal, and exactly what they had relayed to LivingSocial when they set up the deal with LivingSocial reps wasnt my concern. Nor was it my concern how much money they would/wouldnt make from the deal. Simply stated, I told Ernest I was trying to redeem my coupon exactly as it stated on the deal; otherwise the deal was FRAUDULENT!\n\n\"".....um.....hem,haw\""......etc, was his response. \n\nThen Earnest asked me what I did for a living.....What?! You heard right, he asked if I was a writer for a sports magazine. I asked him what bearing this had upon me redeeming my LivingSocial deal.\n\""Oh nothing,\"" he said \"" I was just trying to remember clearly who you were.\""  Okey-doke.....So I redirected Earnest back to the issue at hand, and asked how this issue could be resolved.\n\nErnest told me there was nothing he could do; that the doctor would call me to discuss the situation........I never got a call back.\n\nCompanies need to set up the specifics of their deals clearly and honestly; otherwise deals like this will get a bad name and lose the trust of consumers. Thank God for Livingsocial customer service, though, because they were kind and helpful, giving me a refund for the Idoc fraudulent deal; Livingsocial stood behind their deal.......even when iDoc themselves didnt! My hat's off to LivingSocial.\n\nI just hope that anyone buying a deal similar to the one I purchased with any other company (Groupon, Yipit,Amazon, etc) will stand behind their deals with idoc, and refund customers if/when necessary........ because it looks to me like iDoc is putting the same deal I purchased on different sites.\n\nGood luck friends and savvy consumers."
3,"Went to Mesa Grill on a recent trip to Vegas, and was super excited about it... and for the most part it didn't let us down.  The breakdown:\n\nService: 5 stars.  Our waitress was fantastic and our food came out at just the right pace.\n\nFood: 5 stars.  The tiger shrimp and sweet potato tamale lived up to its reputation, and the salmon was cooked perfectly and had a delicious mole with a ton of flavor underneath.  The other fish we had was also cooked perfectly although the preparation was less unique (it came on top of crab with edamame, corn and a buttery sauce).  The cornbread and jalepeno bread at the beginning is a nice perk and yummy.\n\nMargaritas: 2 stars.  Bummer!  This is the only part that knocks it down to an overall 4 star experience.  Both margaritas we had (one was a cactus pear, the other was another \""speciality\"") were overly sweet, tasted the same, small, and couldn't really taste the tequila.  I was expecting a long list of tasty and inventive margaritas, and instead found a good tequila selection, but nothing more.  If I get the chance to go back, I'll leave the drinking for the casino!"
4,My dogs Oreo and Gizmo have been going to Bev for four years.  She is the only groomer one of my pups has gone to and the other has been going to her since he was like 6 months old.  I always recommed her to anyone  who asks me.  I hear horror stories from other people about groomers.  I am thankful I have never had that with Bev. My boys always look great and never have cuts.\n\nI love the fact that Bev always checks exactly what I want done with their hair and what number to call when my boys are ready. She also takes the time to answer any questions that I have.  I drop my boys off in the morning and get a phone call when they are ready to go home.  Sometimes they are ready as soon as 12 pm and if she is super busy around 2 pm.  \n\nShe is closed on Sunday and Mondays are by appointment only.  She does welcome walk-ins but I highly recommend making an appointment a few days in advance especially around holidays.  \n\nThanks Bev and Kayla!!!
3,"OMG! This place many, many, many years ago used to be where Miracle Mile was...now, it's in the boonies. It's so far out, outside of the strip. We usually get the Classic Pecan Brittle which is devine!!!! It's like $30 for 13 pieces though; so pricey, just like Godiva's. The factory itself is so cute and the staff is so attentive. They are trying to limit their white chocolate selection though...boooo!"
4,This location and staff are wonderful.  The food prepared here was great.  I saw one individual wash his hands about seven times in the length of me at the end of the line to paying for our meal.  This location gets a lot of cater orders so be prepared to maybe wait a little longer than normal around lunch hours.  Otherwise it'll be smooth coasting.
1,"This joint got great overall reviews here on Yelp as well as Trip Advisor. Now I concede- if you're paying $5.99 for breakfast, don't expect Gordon Ramsey fare.  I came here because after 4 days of paying obscene prices to eat a meal on the strip (e.g. $5 for A SLICE of pizza), my pocketbook needed a break. Moreover, after my class I wanted breakfast, and it was after 11 AM on a Saturday.  Now in New York you can get breakfast 24/7, no problem.  & GOOD breakfast at that.  On the Vegas strip you better get breakfast by 11 AM, and brunch fare is very limited.  I don't get this in a non-stop party city like Vegas that you can't get breakfast anytime of day any day of the week, but at least on the weekend. Smdh, but I digress.....\n\nSo my son found this joint that serves breakfast until 2 PM, & I really, really liked the prices.  It's a decent walk off the beaten path, and hence can feel a little unsafe.  But being from Brooklyn, it takes a bit more than that to scare me, but I digress.... Moreover, if you're from New York City you know: sometimes the greatest tasting food comes out of the biggest holes-in-the-wall; look at this Caridad restaurant by Woodhull Hospital in Bushwick, or Angie's Breakfast Spot also in Bushwick.  Anyway, I kept an open mind.\n\nYou have to pass through the small, dingy, smoke-filled casino to get to the dining area.  Mind you all public spaces in New York indoor areas, and even some outdoor spaces, are smoke-free & have been so for many years, so I am unaccustomed to eating around smoke.  As the dining area was not enclosed, the faint odors of tobacco is always present everywhere, including the dining area.\n\nWe had an expected 30 to 40 minute wait, and was seated about 45 minutes later.  My son ordered an egg white cheese omelet.  Problem #1:  egg WHITE.  I ordered safe: bacon & eggs.  Can't mess that one up. Our food came within a reasonable amount of time. What they gave my son was some round, pancake-shaped mass of (WHOLE) egg with 2 slices of what looked like Kraft cheese singles on top (!) (?).  So essentially he didn't get what he ordered, but I was not surprised that they would not understand how to separate out the yolk, and would not be the least bit surprised if they never ever had a customer request egg whites (only). & what the hell, a cheese omelet with the cheese on the OUTSIDE??  I cannot make this stuff up... Good thing he also ordered French toast, although I don't think that was anything to write home about either. \n\nNow my food was just that: scrambled eggs, uninspired but tasty enough albeit slightly greasy bacon, these weird potato things that taste ok/pretty good (probably microwaved from frozen), and toast that was heavily buttered and textured like styrofoam.  \n\nI get it: my breakfast was $5.99, and the whole bill with drinks and extra sides was $23 in total (I almost always tip 20%).  It wasn't like Wolf Gang Puck was back there slinging hash, but like I said before: in New York you can get some absolutely delicious food that is super cheap, so cheap you can feed your whole small family, and it's like you're stealing it-- you know what I'm saying\"" like a whole steamy, juicy, tasty rotisserie chicken from the Dominican Spot with Arroz y gandules or frijoles and/or Maduros for like $10.  And you leave the table rubbing your belly like, \""Damn!\"" Swearing you're not going to eat for a year because you ate long after you were full because the food was That Good.  And you don't have to go to Gordon Ramsey's Steak either.  \n\nAnyway, my point is that the dining experience was blah at best, more like peculiar, and just nauseating at worst.  It wasn't that the food tasted bad, but was not enjoyable. & although you do get what you pay for, that certainly does not hold true necessarily with the New York dining experience (& so I am a bit spoiled!).  Much better food can be found at IHOP, and even Denny's I'd bet, for a few extra dollars."
2,"I am only reviewing their pricing as I did not have this company do any work. I called Repair Guys for drywall pricing after some recent damage due to a leaky roof. They sent two guys out the following day to take a look and give me a price. They wanted to charge a ridiculous price to use a special camera to look behind the drywall which I had to keep telling them I didn't want them to do. I also had a hard time getting them to understand exactly what I wanted them to do. I got prices from 3 other companies and none of them had a problem understanding. It took Repair guys a couple days to put together pricing. When they finally called to go over their pricing they were 3 to 4 TIMES MORE than the other prices. When I told them how much more they were, they tried to justify their prices and even offered to take off $200. I dont know if they thought I didn't know better but there is NO way this job could've cost half of what they priced it at. I ended up going with a company called Accurate Drywall and they did an amazing job even doing more work than I originally planned for 1/4 of the price Repair Guys quoted me."
0,"Super slow! Don't come here if you are in a hurry! 4 registers, only 1 open and super long line. One guy standing there, watching the lady work who is working the only open register! Won't come here again !  Must be nice to just stand around WATCHING others work! DUMBASS!\n\nUPDATE:  WOW talk about R U D E! So I finally get to the front of the line only for stupid asian lady to give me the hand and tell me she is closed.  So I step over to the next line where the lady there was opening (so it appeared), when I stepped over she put up her CLOSED sign and walked away.  Before I could make it over to the third line that had just opened some old bat cut in front of me.  I didn't say anything to her since she was old.  She left and I walk over to line 3 where i was greeted by VIVIAN (she is afro-american), I set my box up on the counter. She flipped out on me stating what you just gonna throw your box up here, again I placed my box on the counter as calmly and nicely as possible.  Then proceeded to berate me saying what do you want me to do with it.  I calmly stated, well generally when you come into the post office to mail a package you place it on the counter and the clerk provided you with excellent customer service and handles the transaction from there.  She yelled at me stating that I needed to wait to be called! I said WHY, the lady you just helped cut in front of me.  Anyway, her ruddiness was uncalled for.  Apparently the Post Office needs to have a training class in customer service skills because she was clearly lacking.  In fact she if damn lucky to have her cushy government job and should be polite to ALL the customers that come through the doors there, without them she wouldn't have that job in the first place!  Just a warning DO NOT get in VIVIAN's line if you can help it, she is a rude BIOTCH!  Completely uncalled for.  THANKFULLY I don't live near this location would NEVER in my life go there again if my life depended on it!"
3,"If you love Mexican food... REAL Mexican food, and you don't want to go out to eat every night, you need to start shopping at a carniceria. Carneceria means 'meat market' in Spanish, or so I so I am told. Most carnicerias I have been in over my lifetime are more like a small grocery store... Los Compadres #3 is, in my opinion, the best in town... \n\nI have only gotten the pre-marinaded chicken and steak (carne asada) here. They pound the meat thin and use a very tasty, not too spicy marinade so all you have to do is slap the meat on a preheated grill for a few minutes on each side. \n\nIn the back of the store there is a service counter where you can buy premade food. Yummy taquitos and excellent rice. Great pico de gallo, and the guacamole is very tasty."
2,"Sketch-tastic. Just take a look at the neon lights and you won't argue.\n\nThis is where the east side meets willy street with a little downtown thrown in the mix. The crowd is very entertaining- anyone you could think of could be in at a given night.\n\nLots of beer, darts, and pool. All things considered, it's a pretty solid place. Plus - it brings back the innocence of smoking: a vending machine with candy cigarettes.\n\nRecently though- did the beer get more expensive or is it just me?"
1,"Ok, so I went to Andiamo Bistro because of the groupon and I can honestly say that I would never go back.  First of all, the place needs to be updated badly.  The seating and tables were fine, but the white paint on the walls was dirty and the shelving around the bar was disgusting.  I paid $20 for a $40 groupon.  We asked for prosecco off of the menu and they were out of it.  We then asked for 2 diet cokes and received 2 cans on the table.  We were surprised by that.  I ordered the veal picatta and my friend ordered the chicken marsala.  The dinner came and there was two small extremely rubbery pieces of meat and a small bit of pasta with very little sauce on top.  Normally veal is cut very easily, but I was barely able to cut mine with a knife.  The marinara sauce on the pasta was bland and tasted like it was from a jar.  My friend felt the same way with her chicken.  The portions were extremely small.  The check came - 2 diet sodas, one chicken and one veal was $43.00.  Extremely overpriced for the quality of food.  We had no problem forking over the groupon and I was very glad that I only paid $20 for it. It was worth $20, no where close to $40.  Dont even waste your money at this place."
4,"Been there three times, twice dinner and once for coffee and dessert. This is the best restaurant within Mandalay Bay. The tatsing menu are terrific and best value on the strip. The staff goes out of their way to make you welcome. They even accomodate our twin infants and make them feel welcome."
1,"When a place is called M:Brgr, you're going in there for the burgers and that's what I'm rating this place based on.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's an EXCELLENT place to go, order a $50 pitcher and enjoy it with your friends as hot waitresses come and ask you if everything is alright. With the music, fancy walls, tables and bar - it's a great pub-like place.\n\nAs a restaurant... Eeeeeehh... Not so much.\n\nAs always, when rating the burger I go for the classic to have a level-ground with all other burger joints in Montreal.\n\nHere, the burger is either a $10 regular burger, a $15 or something slightly bigger regular burger and then it whizzes to a $40 Kobe beef monstrosity with fois gras, blue cheese black truffles. You can even customise your own burger, adding shredded white truffles for $10, blue cheese for $10. Really, it is in the realm of possibility to make a $100 burger.\n\nThe regular burger: Meh. Meh. MEH! I got the regular burger and an apple cider (I've never tried that before - I lived in a country where buying alcohol was not permitted outside of a 5-star hotel). The sauce, whose name I can no longer remember, which they put on the burger is basically ketchup and mayo. Not so great. The meat? Tasted like McD's. Again, this is THE CLASSIC, REGULAR BURGER. I'm not paying $40 for a Kobe beef BURGER! If I'm gonna pay for Kobe beef, I'm having it as a steak, damn it!\n\nReally, I haven't got much to say about this place - the service is slow as HELL!! It's completely ridiculous. The food is expensive and the drinks are even more expensive.\n\nLike I said, you have some money to spare and want a really fancy bar to order a $50 pitcher of vodka and lemonade, then this place is by all means a place to go to. If you want to go for their Brgr (cheap shot - forgive me) then go, but the \""U\"" and \""E\"" are missing from the name because the burger is also lacking in contentment."
4,Best hot and sour soup in town. OMG.  You can't go wrong in this place.   Best customer service.
3,"This brunch buffet is very different from other Vegas buffets.  It's hosted only on Sundays at the steakhouse in Bally's.  They have a smaller number of stations that most buffets, however the quality and content of what's served is really great.  They have 8oz lobster tails, snow crab legs, caviar, gourmet desserts, champagne, and other breakfast/brunch items.  Let's face it, you go for the prime rib, lobster, crab, and caviar.  If you like those four items, it's worth it to pay $90+.  Otherwise, you might be disappointed.  I really enjoyed it, and would definitely return."
0,"If I could give this place a negative star rating I would. Food is awful and service is the same, awful! Save yourself and go somewhere different."
3,"So, hubby and I got stuck (literally) at Town Square last Halloween due to Town Scary (Halloween event on Sunday, October 31st).  You know, where kids walk past stores and trick-or-treat, etc.  There were ton of families milling about. Seriously, I've never seen so many people at Town Square before. We tried to leave at some point and realized that it would take us a good hour just to get out of the parking lot. At that point, we re-assessed plans to eat dinner at home and decided to eat at Town Square instead.  So we decided to check-out Kabuki because it was one of the restaurants at Town Square we hadn't tried.\n\nAdmittedly, I was a bit resistant to the idea of chain sushi restaurant at a big retail shopping center. So I didn't have the highest expectations. But -- big but -- I was pleasantly surprised! We sat at the sushi bar and had the following rolls:     \n\n--Vegas roll\n--Spider roll\n--Baja roll\n--Spicy tuna tempura roll\n\nTwo initial thoughts: the Vegas and Baja rolls were the bomb.  The Baja roll was not only different, but excellent.  It had jalape\u00f1os and pico de gallo on top. It was sooooo good! It was light, fresh, and flavorful. Same goes with the Vegas roll. I am a big fan of tempura sushi and cream cheese in rolls (which I know not everyone is a big fan of), so this was the best of both worlds.\n\nI've subsequently visited during Happy Hour. The Happy Hour specials are off a smaller menu, but still nothing to sneeze at. I had some cucumber concoction and it was delicious. \n\nHighly recommend!"
3,"I live right around the corner from this new brunch spot.  Finally tried it and it's my new favorite!  Very friendly staff and yummy food!  I love their biscuits and their homemade strawberry jam is to die for.  Haven't had a meal I didn't like yet.  The only thing I did not like was the giant glob of butter served on the cinnamon roll.  This is personal preference though, so I certainly do not fault for that!"
1,"OVERALL:\nGiven the popularity of Girasole, I was disappointed that this place didn't even come close to living up to the hype. Although there were some highlights, there were plenty of negatives to counter them.\n\nSERVICE:\nDespite having a reservation, we were made to wait for over 45 minutes for a table, standing outside in the cold. Also, we were only given cutlery for two of the three people in our party. Not a good start. Once seated, though, the service was good. Our server, Vito, was pleasant and attentive.\n\nFOOD:\nDisappointing. The bread brought to our table was stone cold, and the accompanying butter was rock hard and still in the commercial packaging. I expect to get butter in little plastic tubs at a diner, but not at a relatively upscale restaurant like Girasole. Furthermore, the fact that the bread was cold and the butter was practically frozen made it impossible to spread. Not a good start. \n\nFortunately, it improved from there. The salad course was the highlight of the meal - the greens were crisp and the addition of sunflower seeds and bleu cheese crumbles gave it wonderful texture and flavor. This was the best part of the meal.\n\nMy steak was tender and the meat was of good quality. However, it was a tad under-seasoned and the accompanying risotto was undercooked and quite bland. The polenta that was served with my wife's chicken was also bland and under-seasoned. \n\nDesserts were average. I had the chocolate mousse cake, which sounded delicious, but ultimately the quality was on par with what you would get at a supermarket bakery. My wife had the coconut cream cake, which turned out to just be yellow cake with some coconut frosting.\n\nAMBIANCE: \nProbably the best thing about this place. It is quaint and intimate. The decor is charming and it's in a lovely location.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nProbably a better bet on an off-peak night and when the weather is nicer, but if it's a busy night and it's cold out, I'd give it a miss."
4,Great food and fun atmosphere! Great place to get together with friends and family. I love the cheesy cheese burger and mini donuts. Excellent service!
1,"wow, i was kinda disappointed with this place. my stomach even feels kinda queasy, we just got home. \ni expected more - we went on a friday night, the place was busy. i didn't think it was hard to mess up sauces with coconut milk. i love coconut milk. \nwe ordered: the potstickers (steamed) they were fine. one person ordered a soup-it was ok. it came with potstickers though that wasn't listed in the menu. \nsomeone ordered the curry fried rice with tofu-probably the best of the bunch.\ni ordered the squash curry. hubby, curry duck. Both came with red curry. we know duck in general is fatty, but this was really fatty, and fried. the squash and thai eggplant in my squash curry wasn't ripe. My dish wasn't spicy at all.\n\ni think there are too many items on the menu. Maybe editing down the menu would help?\nwe've had Thai in DC at dozens of places and all were better than this.\n\nconsidering my positive experiences at many other Madison restaurants, i was surprised by how bad this place was."
0,"Underwhelming. The entrees (steak fajita salad and veggie enchilada) were bland and mostly, well, whatever a good synonym for bland would be: tasteless, flavorless, dull...beige. It's basically Mexican food for people who like Mexican food but don't like all the flavor and spices and all the other stuff that makes Mexican food worth eating. At least the steak was stringy and the choice of vegetables was odd. (Who puts broccoli in fajitas?) \n\nI will say this in Juan's favor: True to their name, the fajitas were indeed flaming when they got to the table. But once the flames were extinguished so was our enthusiasm for the food."
3,"The lunch buffet is a good value at $7.99.  There was a standard selection of typical dishes, from tasty samosas to tandoori chicken and chicken tikka.  I appreciated that some of the dishes had a little kick and weren't dumbed-down to cater toward an uncultured American palate.  The buffet also came with some very plain but fresh and warm naan.\n\nThe service was average and the decor is very basic.  A small Indian grocery store is also located within the building."
3,"If the fresh corn tacos are there. You need to get it. ASAP. Amazing with beef and pico de gallo. \n\n-Lamb was also excellent, even for a buffet. Medium rare and very flavorful. \n-salmon and tuna sashimi were on point. I usually never trust sushi at buffets, but it had me coming back for more. So fresh.\n-udon was a bit off. So was the ramen. I thinks the soups went bad or something.\n-miso cod was hard and extremely salty with the miso.\n-try the TRUFFLE SCALLOPED POTATOES. I was crying tears of joy after the first bite.\n\nWent here on a Thursday and got in after 15minutes. Wouldn't dare coming here on a weekend. Some people wait up to 3 hours. I don't think it's worth that long however."
1,"the food was better than i though and it was cheap. come here of you are not picky, if you know real mexican food you are going to be dissapointed but for the price what the heck"
4,"Delicious cappuccino.  Good strength (not watery) espresso.  Mine was done up with whole milk in the 5.5 oz \""for here\"" ceramic mug (vs to go paper cup).  Soft, clean and relaxed industrial style.  Open atmosphere.  Seating indoors and out.  Friendly baristas, reasonably priced.  Busy enough, yet easily found seating.  I'll definitely try to visit this nice little shop again."
1,"We've been to Foodies Festivals before, but this was the first we'd been to at the EICC. Unfortunately, we went on Saturday, and it was beyond crowded and verging on dangerous. They should have allowed much more space between stands to reduce the crush, making grazing more pleasurable, and rendering it safe for pushchairs and wheelchairs. \n\nWhile there was little knew in terms of exhibitors, the quality was high and the samples good. The Extraordinary Sausage Company, in particular, was doing a roaring trade throughout the day, with some excellent produce; I recommend their sausages with Scotch Bonnet peppers. Unfortunately, the crowds they generated added to the crush. \n\nA good time, then, but disappointingly badly organised."
2,Store is always fully stocked and clean.\n\nThey finally got the mini Starbucks area finish and open!!
0,"I am sick to my stomach... I have to submit a star as a way of rating this %# hole!! I opened this YELP account for the sole purpose of writing this review...... I will follow up with pictures, but do not have time as enough time has been wasted... I am not sure how to put it.. I waited just 40 minutes for my car to go from the gas pump to the Auto-wash area talk about speedy service... After 40 minutes I made the manager aware of the long amount of time it was taking for my car to get into the bleeping wash.... He explained the reason was a car in front of my car was full of dog hair that needed extra attention and it took 35 minutes to vacuum...40 minutes to get it in the wash....!!   I am not exaggerating the times here!! To put this in to perspective you know the point where they complete the glass and interior well 70 minutes had gone by and I was at the 3rd car back in this line!!! This is even after notifying a the manager KEVIN Duche!!! All in all my car never made it to the interior cleaning or glass cleaning area.. It simply finished drying in line in line... I had the manager pull 2 cars out of the way so I could leave... The chalk is still on my windows from where they documented my wash and the time I arrived 12:31 PM... I didn't leave until 1:46 PM and my car STILL  didn't get dried or the interior cleaned... COME ON MAN!! FIRE KEVIN THE MANAGER... This GUY IS A FN JOKE... THIS CAR WASH IS A JOKE.. THIS PLACE IS GARBAGE bring the immigrants back holy %^&^!~!  I am so pissed off I wish we lived in mid evil times ... NEVER TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE EVER!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED..."
1,"Place is lovely, got a great gel mani from sabrina. The first time. Was ecstatic to find a good place near Central. \n\n Today i returned for the third time, excited once again. They close at 7, but I came in amd there was only one girl who was taking her last client- at 5:30pm, was borderline rude. I think she just wanted to go home early. \n\nThis place is not good for walk-ins at all. They'll give you looks if you don't have an appointment- i know because i came back three times and each time there was always a reason why the couldn't take me."
4,this is my go to bank. im suprised that this bank has such a low yelp rating.mthe store manager benjamin actually helped me open 2 savings accounts and taught me quite a bit about emergency savings and main saving. i am forever grateful as i am still very young- 16. and i dont know too much about money management. after spending an afternoon here talking with ben he was very helpful and understanding and met all of my banking needs. i go here to cash my checks every couple of weeks and i always put a chunk into each savings account.
0,"Apparently, under new management - FAIL!!!! Gas and inside store OK and friendly. Stay away from the unprofessional and lazy car wash area. Left me sitting in hot car while chatting with car in front of me. Took my prepaid ticket, but left me standing next to car so there was no conversation about what I expected to have done. I paid to have car washed, inside and out. Been going there for about 4 years and expected excellent job as usual. Gave guy $5 tip and wasn't until I was driving down the road that I realized they never did the inside of the car. I wasn't going back, because they were backed up busy, since they're so disorganized. I'll take the $150 that I spend a month there on gas, snacks and car washes to some place else."
4,"Best shrimp tacos ever! Best cerveza preparadas ever! Awesome service! Nobody ever gives me a hard time for not speaking Spanish.....probably cuz I'm Asian. There are places that expect me to speak Spanish cuz they assume I am Latina but it's all good over here.\n\nTheir fish and shrimp tacos are battered and fried, served with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, and a white cream sauce with a lemon wedge. If I can recall they are huge and cost about $3 - $3.50. Not bad at all cuz they are not greedy here. The campachana cocktail with shrimp and octopus always tastes so fresh. I have yet to find it better anywhere else.\n\nTheir cerveza preparadas are made with a concoction of shrimp stock, lime juice, hot sauce and whatever beer of your choosing. They are served in a frosty goblet that makes the beer so delicious on a hot day, after a long day at work, after a long night of partying--the morning after of course, or just any old freaking time they're open. The first few sips have that icey layer of frost on them that I just love so much. Almost like a beer slurpee, kinda....not really. Just go there and get one. Only then will you know exactly what i mean."
4,"Everything was excellet!!! Food, Sake, service and etc etc...  I can't wait to come back."
0,"Casino: plenty of new games to keep players amused both old and new. The two floor layout means the upper level tends to get less smokey. Lack of washroom facilities (there's only one near the check-in desk) on the ground floor can be problematic for those playing on the far side.\n\nRestaurants: Ground floor McDonald's and a Krispy Creme. Upper level a Steak House (which has been closed every time we visit for the last five years.. we must have terrible timing lol..) and an open restaurant that has a buffet for some meals and also menu ordering.  \n\nOther: Nice that it's on the Fremont Street Experience. Parking is free for guests, you just sign your ticket with your name and room number. Others get 4 hrs free but I believe they have to be validated at the hotel desk before you leave the hotel. When we were there one of the two elevators to the parking garage was out of operation so the waits were pretty long. Only two towels for the bath so if you need an extra one for your hair after you and your spouse have showered, you're out of luck.\n\nHotel: Never again! Like I said we have been coming here for years. It's always been on the slightly yukky side, odd stains, bathroom corners not really clean .. I'd *never* go barefoot .... but it's definitely gone downhill from there. This time we found bedbugs which totally grossed me out. We should have checked the bed and headboard before we unpacked but did not suspect them. I will never stay in this hotel again."
1,"I had to bring my son here at the last minute to get his arm checked out for a basketball injury.  This is the only place that had an opening on the Tuesday after Labor Day, so we came here instead of UMC Quick Care.  Well, wouldn't you know it took us probably longer here than UMC?  We arrived at 2:30pm for a 2:45pm appointment and waited two hours to be seen by a nurse practitioner.  The staff here was friendly and we did leave with a prescription for steroids for my son, but I don't think we'll be back.  I really need to find a good family doctor when we're healthy, not when we're sick."
0,"Not a fan at all of this place. Sure I'm biased as I grew up in New England, but seriously this is just terrible food, terrible service, and really not worth the money. I was trying this place for a second time to give it a fair chance. My fiance and her friend love this place so I went along to give it a second shot. When I pointed out to a friend that was eating the shrimp that if he peeled off the breading and looked at how much shrimp was in there he would be suprised... He did it and just as suspected there was a little piece of shrimp about the size of a maccaroni elbow stuffed into all of that breading. All we could do was laugh... this place is a joke."
3,"I really enjoy Village Inn and being back in Glendale, it's nice to have one near me.  And by near me, I mean about two blocks down the road.  This location was the same one I had my graduation dinner after high school.. yeah I know.  big spender.\n\nWe decided to go for breakfast on Sunday morning.  Showed up and as expected there was a large crowd.  Mostly older people and a few young families.  This place is kinda cool cause you can see that the staff has worked there for many years.. kinda reminded me of the old Smitty's restaurants.  Remember those?\n\nWhat i ordered for breakfast was an iced tea and an omelet with a side of cakes.  I decided on the California omelet.  I really didn't like it.  not because the eggs were bad or anything was not cooked or anything.  It had onions and I'm a huge onion hater. By onion, i mean the large slab slices.. not sauteed or anything.  Along that was cooked spinach.  Yeck.   \n\nDoesn't change me eating there.  This place is still great, I just will get something else next time. :)"
4,"They make my Manolo Blahnik's purr - nuff said!!\nI have risked my shoe collection at many local repair shops - but he is an honest, hard-working man who knows quality. They are reasonably priced and turn-around times are quick!\nLocated on the NW corner of Scottsdale Rd and Thunderbird in the strip mall a couple doors down from Enterprise Car Rental."
0,"Wendy's has gone waaaay down hill.  Ever sunce they changed the menu to sweet pickles, frys and red onions its hard to enjoy a meal here.\nWendys change the menu back!!!!!"
4,"Okay a local favorite for many years. if anybody's ever eaten at the omelette house they know how good the food is. If you haven't eaten at the omelette house what a shame you missed out all these years. \n\nThey serve breakfast & lunch with lots of delicious omelettes, good sandwiches and of course the banana nut bread and the pumpkin bread is worthy of going just for that. The names for the different omelettes are pretty funny\n\nIt's tucked in the back of a shopping center. From the looks of the exterior you would never dream of all the delicious things behind the doors. Family owned and operated it has kind of a grandma's kitchen feel with wood d\u00e9cor and pictures of the family on the walls as you walk in the door.very busy around lunch time so come early. Lots of seating and they get you through during lunch pretty quick, it's just busy.\n\nI had the Californian omelette and it had sausage avocado and Jack cheese the home cut potatoes are thin cut like chips with seasoning. My wife had a omelette with peppers and cheddar make sure you order the baby omelette unless you're extremely hungry the omelettes are big! \n\nGreat for breakfast"
1,"Meh. \n\nThe Buffalo (a place in America) wings were very good but had absolutely no heat.  The Viking (a guy from Norway) hamburger had absolutely no flavor--NONE!.  If this is what food is like in Norway, I understand why so many Norwegians moved here.  Furthermore it explains why Vikings were pissed off all the time.\n\nDid I give it too many stars for a meh?"
0,"We've given this establishment our dollars on many occasions since this location has been opened.  The visit on Sunday (9/21)  will probably be our last. We were looking forward to watching football in a fun, group setting.... eating some awesome fall off the bone ribs and having a couple of beers.  A portion of the bad experience can be faulted towards other customers - screaming (like bloody murder) kids, parents who ignored them and a much older guy who kept staring and inching his chair closer to our table.  Eww.   But I digress.  I'm here to talk about the food and service.  After finally being seated (because of the football crowd), we waited for 10 minutes at our table before anyone even acknowledged we were there.  Then we ordered our food... which we waited... and waited for.  When it finally came, the ribs were fatty and barely warm. The fries were cold but the ranch dressing was good.  The garlic bread could have been used to replace a roof tile. To round it out, the zucchini was fair to middlin.  The beers were not that cold... so that couldn't even save the day.  We left before halftime - and to you other sports fans out there - you know it had to be bad!  While the restaurant cannot control who walks in their doors, they can provide good food and proper service.  Bad on them....  disappointing."
4,"Hands down, the best tailor in town (and I've been to many).  Are they the cheapest?  No...but if you enjoy quality, Zizzo is the place to go.  The best part, if you want something altered ever further, there is no fuss about it, they just do it.  My dress shirts and sport coats fit me like they were custom made.  I will never go anywhere else..."
2,"I came here because of the good Yelp reviews.  My initial impression was good.  It was decorated for Halloween and has a cool vibe.  The have a few booths on the far wall which kind offered a bit of privacy.  \n\nWe started with the dumplings which were large and had a nice sear on them.  The problem for me was the filling.  I am not a fan of onions and they were full of them.  Speaking of onions, we ordered the corn with cheese.  I expected corn and cheese, but not tons of onions.  The corn was sweet and I would have enjoyed it without the onions.  \n\nWe finished with the bibambap.  It was large and not bad, but I would liked to have had an uncooked egg instead of a fully cooked one inside.\n\nThe food was ok, but the service sucked.  It is not a large place...come around once in a while and check on your guests."
2,"I was kinda disappointed. Was our first time eating here. Although we tried to eat here a week or so ago, but they apparently closed early and weren't taking any more orders at 7:30pm. \n\nWe ordered a pizza, salad, and a sausage sandwich.  \n\nWe tried to order their Sicilian pizza but they said they were out. So we had to eat a regular pizza. \n\nThe pizza and sandwich were ok, the sauce was very lacking, like a plain tomato Sauce. I will admit I am picky with pizza sauce. \n\nThe sandwich had the same sauce I believe as the pizza, which kinda made it not so enjoyable. But it was pretty good size and filling. \n\nThe salad was actually pretty decent, we just got the regular house salad and added cheese. The ingredients were all fresh and crisp. I would consider ordering just a salad from here in the future if they were still open at the time we wanted to eat. \n\nAll in all I wish we had ordered dominoes instead, but they don't have salads."
3,"Last month was my first time checking out their happy hour. & let me just say.. amazing!! Great prices on great drinks and food. Bahamaritas are my favorite. A must try! The sangria was ok.. not the best, but hey I drank it anyway. I also got a Blue Moon which I love. As far as food goes, we ordered most of the happy hour menu. Lots of food! The only reason I'm giving them four stars is because the service was pretty slow. It took foreeeever to get the check and then even longer to pay. But overall, very nice happy hour experience. I've been many times not during happy hour and I always get the jerk chicken pasta. It's soooo good!"
4,"Excellent local flair. Just had to go reading all the other reviews. The new location is brightly lite, warm and welcoming. Thought it was great that Carlos was there and chatted with the customers. We had the buffalo chicken wrap and sandwich. Both excellent and the onion rings were out of this world!!! Love this place."
3,"Rented a subcompact car from this Enterprise location. Arrived at scheduled time and there were no sub-compact cars available, but they upgraded me from a Chevy Spark to a newish 5 door Toyota Yaris at no additional charge, which was great. No problems with the Yaris, returned it with slightly more gas than it had when I picked it up. The manager offered me a ride home so I didn't have to call a cab -- on a 115 degree day, I'd recommend this location and will use this branch again."
1,"Never leave any - and I mean not even a piece of cheap jewelry in your room. I had a $30 bracelet taken from my room after we left for a show at 8:30pm! Called security filled out report and they said \""we will get back to you in 72hrs. Never heard back. I know it's a cheap piece of jewelry, but it's a matter of principle! Also left my iPhone charger in my room and of course \""it was not turned in\"" . What goes around comes around. Where are all the honest people? Not in Vegas!  This never would happen in The Mandarin, next time I'll stay there!"
0,"It's interesting that we have to sign a waiver but can't jump together as a family. We have a 2,4,5 and 12 year old, I recommend flip and out!"
1,"Same concept as Salsarita's, except it's Mongolian bbq...save your money and go down the block to Hibachi Grill if you want customized cooking...the ingredients are better...the people that have given Genghis Grill a star above 3 are fooled by the gimmick of being your own chef...it's hit or miss...hello, you can do that in your own kitchen...not worth the money, after the newness wears out, this place will go under...I give it 3 years, there are better options people!"
3,"A tasteful restaurant for the Montreal hipster vegan  with money to burn!\n\nThat said, all the items of the menu that we tried tonight were well worth the money, including the 12$ margarita \u00e0-la-Santa-Barbara. Non-vegan options include fish, lamb and mussels -- I tried the mussels and they tasted great. Kale is on the menu, in case you were wondering. \n\nThe place is an upscale offshoot of the celebrated breakfast place Le Vieux V\u00e9lo, located in the same area. Santa Barbara also does brunches, but we tried it only for a 7pm Friday dinner. By 7:30pm it was already packed and they don't take reservations. Arrive early!"
0,"I will never go in to this store again. What a bunch of snobs! I went in to buy a mountain bike and needed to get all the extras as well. This was the only shop open at the time and I should have just walked out and waited but I was anxious.\n\nThis being my first real bike, I did mot know the correct size I needed. The snob worker only showed me one bike and said it was a perfect fit for me. How was I supposed to know? I trusted him. It turns out, it was too small for me and it was also the only bike they had in stock that day so that is why they sold it to me.\n\nI did not realize it was too small until I was riding downhill and felt like I was on a children's bike. I went to another bike shop to ask what size I should be using and they said much bigger than what I had. SHAME on you McGhie's for selling me a $2,000.00 bike that is useless to me.\n\nWhen I called to complain, I was treated like an idiot and again you were a bunch of snobs. Now I need to purchase another bike that fits me and I am stuck with this bike. What a waste of money. You will never get my business again or business from anyone that I know."
1,"The food was delicious but the service was dismal. They rush you through the line expecting that you know exactly how it works even if you have never been there. If you ask a question they look at you like you're a bother, and don't take the time to explain how their menu works. The bathrooms were in bad shape and there was no changing table. Not sure if we will return. Overall not happy."
4,Great Food and Great Service.  Our go to restaurant in Cave Creek!!   Sad so many schleppers come to CC to review OUR restaurants and leave bull shit 1 star reviews.  This place is a gem and we LOVE the food and service.  \n\nPretentious Yentas from Phoenix leave your 1 star reviews at home!  Cave Creek is a tough town to exist and we do not like people disparaging our establishments.
3,"I live down the road from it and it's the closest place to still offer a salad bar. The salad bar is great and you can get it for a reasonable price as a side item along with your main course.  \n\nThe menu prices are very reasonable and the service is good. The quality of the food is as expected for a typical mid priced national chain, not great but not by either."
2,"Despite it's name (which gave me moment for pause when deciding if I wanted to check it out), Xtreme Bean is a hip coffee house with a college feel (they even have a \""study room\"" with quasi-cubicles that is ironically placed in what used to be a bank vault). Further, for those of you that spend hours on end in coffeehouses, THEY HAVE FREE WI-FI :-D\n\nThe \""coffee flavored coffee\"" and tropical ice tea are good (I personally tend not to stray into more interesting coffee drinks, so you'd have to check those out yourself) and the entire selection of both food and drinks is very reasonably priced (compared to corporate coffee).\n\nAs of this post, there is ragtime piano on Monday nights as well as performers on the weekends.\n\nThey have a drive-through window.\n\nOh yeah, they don't appear to have updated their website in quite some time... most importantly, their hours of operation. The website says they are open 24-hours on the weekend... but I *think* they are closing at 1am in the summer.\n\nEDIT: Go for the pumpkin muffins... they are most excellent.\n\nEDIT 2: Due to the recent rise in popularity of this coffeehouse, I can no longer get my beloved muffins as they all sell out long before I arrive at night. *tear* Oh yeah... and all the employees probably think I'm that crazy muffin guy. *shrugs*\n\nEDIT 3: I'm officially downgrading my review from a 4 to a 3 as it's now difficult to get a table indoors and I have no interest in sitting in the smoker's lounge which is their patio area. *sigh*"
1,"My girlfriend and I usually eat breakfast in, we decided to go out for a late breakfast the other day and she suggested we'd have a good breakfast at Toast. I could have been more disappointed. I'm not much a bread eater so I went for an omelet, it came out cold and I had to have it remade. Even warm it was rather lackluster for the price. I told her I'd consider giving it another chance, but I'd much rather go to one of my favorite breakfast place.\n\nTo be fair, I tried some of my girlfriend's Avocado omelet and it was better than mine and didn't come out cold. My omelet was the Usual and I don't recommend it."
2,"I stopped in late on a Sunday afternoon and only 2-3 other tables were taken besides ours. Despite the tavern's emptiness, the hostess wanted to seat us at the bar (we refused) and when other patrons came in, they were also directed to the bar (including an old couple). I noticed that there WERE some reserved tables, but not all of them, so I don't know why everyone was asked to sit at the bar.  We were also told we had to be out of there by 7:30. Considering we arrived around 4:30pm, I think the hostess jumped the gun a little. I mean, why not just tell me to go elsewhere while you're at it? The wait staff wasn't exactly warm and welcoming so I can't say that I wanted to spend an extended amount of time there anyway. My friend and I were in our Lululemon gear because we'd walked up the mountain, so I'm not sure if this impacted the level of service that we got, but anyway. We weren't impressed, especially considering how much they charge for food and drinks. \n\nThe decor is gorgeous - I loved it! It's very classy and reminds me of old-school British pubs, with bottles lining the wall, a wood bar/furniture etc. Visually, this place is very appealing. It's also quite quite large, and has a small terrace.  \n\nIn terms of food, I wasn't impressed at all. I ordered the beet salad with goat cheese and it was very ordinary. The beets were good, but they were served with lettuce and ranch dressing, and the beets weren't even warm. The goat cheese also wasn't crumbled. Typically, if I see a beet salad on the menu, I'm expecting warm beets and crumbled goat cheese, with some kind of light dressing.  I was aware of the rand dressing scenario but I guess the salad wasn't what I expected. Overall, the salad was bland and overpriced at $15. I also ordered some fries that were served in a small bowl. The fries were crispy and good, but way overpriced at $6. I can get an entire basket of home fries at any other pub in town for about the same price or less. My friend also felt that her beer was overpriced. I had a Pimm's Cup, which was delicious but I can't really comment on the price ($11) because I've never ordered this anywhere else in Montreal.\n\nI would say it's definitely a great place for drinks, but save your cash and dine elsewhere."
3,"I've ordered 2500+ rounds online from SGC and have always been satisfied by their prices on FMJ .45 ACP.  I'm interested in the 360, programmable target movement and Machine Gun Adventures at their club.  If ever in the Phoenix area, I definitely will plan a visit to Scottsdale Gun Club."
2,"Great food, but go during lunch if you can it's a lot cheaper. Atmosphere was just ok but the food makes up for it"
0,"First let me say I will never come back to this place and they jacked my Coach sunglasses!! I was impressed upon initially walking in b/c it smelled great. They offer you a free taste of bread as you walk in. My bf went w/ red, white and blue. It was good but not spectacular. I went w/ Coconut Walnut. OMG really good. but the service RUINED it for me. \n\nWe came in for a brkfst sandwich of which they only have 2 options eggs and ham or eggs and bacon - seems simple enough right? you also (acc'd to the paper you write your order down on yourself ) to add tomato or green pepper. Odd combo but ok. mybf ordered \n1) ham, egg, cheese, tomato and green peppers\nme i ordered:\n2) bacon, egg, cheese and green peppers\n\nwell first she came back .. do you want cheese? \nyes.. i circled cheddar.. ok\nthen she came back.... we are out of wheat bread do you want another?\nwell.. yeah (i dont want to eat a bread free sandwich)... what do youhave?\nher: we have xyz and soudough\nme: ok Ill have soudough (my bf ordered white)\n\nwe finally get our order - both were on sourdough I might add.. \nNeither had tomato or green peppers... \nmy bf took his bk and asked about it and she just looked @ him and said well.. what do you want me to do?\nthe BF: he said well can you fix it? \nshe started  um... well.. um.. and um... er... \nfinally my bf just said well can you give it to me on the side? \nHER: yeah that's a good idea. you can see the photo on the side.\n\n\nI walked out and realized I had left my Coach glasses on the table. I went bk in and they were already gone. This was not a place I'd ever go back. After this neither of the girls would look us in the eye. it seemed like 2 girls that had no idea what they were doing.. One of them commented to my bf that they had been there since 5 am to bake bread.. um.. so that means its ok to mess up our order b/c you start your workday early? \nThe fact this place was empty should've tipped us off. As we left there was an elderly couple walking in, I said whatever y ou do just stick to the bread - the sandwiches are TOO COMPLICATED for them to make and they've been working since 5 (she said it, me.. so this was not an insult, just a disclaimer I was passing along)"
0,"I'm a huge fan of most ***bertos type joints. I occasionally enjoy having lard drip down my chin after biting into a questionable beef taco...       NOT HERE. \n\nThe oil very obviously hadn't been replaced in who knows how long. It was pure sickness. I am not a picky eater by any stretch. Growing up with little $ has it's perks in that way. Something has to have zero redeeming qualities for me to not just eat it anyway.\n\nI usually love fish tacos at places like this but these were fucking awful, not crispy, sauce tasted like straight mayo tacos from Hades.      blech!\nI won't return. I'm taking a long break from any ***bertos as well after this experience. My heart and cholesterol levels thank you Eribertos."
2,"I've been to 5Church a couple of times now and it's A-OK in my book. \n\nThe one thing that stands out to me is the great smelling candle that was burning in the women's bathroom. Aside from that, I'm not sure 5Church is really for me. Clearly it's received great reviews and I quite like it's sister restaurant, Nan & Byron's, but just because I like one sister, doesn't mean they are both alike. The restaurant itself is a bit dark and doesn't have a warm, inviting feel. The first time I was here was during a Yelp event and it was too crowded making the second level hot and stuffy. \n\nThis last time I went, I made reservations before a show and they got my guest and I seated promptly. We both ordered the lamb burger and it was good, but it doesn't really work as a burger. We both found it to be messy and ended up eating it with our forks. Also, the energy of the place was dull. Perhaps it was because it was cold outside and during the afternoon. In any case, I just wasn't feeling it. Although, I can definitely see the appeal for an early 20s crowd on a Friday or Saturday night.\n\nThe food is good, the location is close if you are seeing a show at the Belk Theater. If, however, you are looking for a more warm and inviting place, try their other restaurant."
4,I called Macias Landscaping because I got a letter from the town of Tempe saying they were going to fine me because of my palm trees being overgrown. They were able to come out the day after I called them and was even able to come particularly early because of my work schedule. The palm trees look great and I really appreciated the quick response and fast service. I would definitely recommend Macias to anyone needing their palms trimmed.
4,"YUM!!  Mac's was exactly what I wanted it to be: welcoming, noisy and smells delicious! I had the smoked turkey with mac and cheese and grits.  The turkey was juicy and flavorful.  The sides were delicious and grits were perfect.  The service was great and moved surprisingly well for how crowded the floor plan is as well as how many patrons were there! Recommend to anyone!"
0,"Well the fun continues with verizon. That refund that ballooned from 2 weeks to 3 months. Their customer service in irvine California called to apologize, of course that apology turned my past quote of 5 days to 2 weeks into an additional 4 to 5 weeks. Sounds like a sound apology to me. Um yes you were told um 2 weeks max but I got on that right away and it's only going to be 4 weeks minimum from this point instead if the 2 you were told. Isn't that great. Hopefully yelp and the 5 consumer advocacy groups I contacted can get the ball rolling, or maybe each one will keep adding a month as is tradition in verizon land. Guess my grand kids can get that measly refund sometime in their lifetime. My previous comment about verizon being good but not that location, I take it back. It's a scam. Tony soprano would be envious. Two cans and a string would be far better than verizon and their customer care."
3,"Been wanting to try this new place and finally got my chance tonight.  We've driven by numerous times since they opened last spring but the crowds always kept us away.  Monday night was quiet and easy to get in.  Unfortunately we just missed Happy Hour (3-6pm) but looks like they have a nice offering with a reduction of price on many tempting appetizers & drinks.  I saw some mighty tasty looking appetizers passing by and I look forward to trying the bruschetta board on a future visit.\n\nWe both had sandwiches - I tried the Capri with mozzarella, prosciutto, pesto & roasted peppers on thick sliced honey wheat bread.  There was an insane amount of prosciutto and half a sandwich was more than enough for me.  He had the turkey & cheddar Panini and French fries, neatly consumed and thoroughly enjoyed.  \n\nI liked the atmosphere of this place, kind of hipster but relaxed & comfortable.  In cooler weather it would be nice to dine on their ample patio.  I appreciated the bottle of chilled water promptly delivered when we sat down.  We did not find noise to be a problem here and the server was excellent, all the way from the friendly hostess to our very efficient waiter.    \n\nI noticed quite a few takeout orders being placed and/or picked up.  On Tuesdays they offer $5.99 dinner-plate sized pizza w/ purchase of a beverage.  Yup, I'm already looking at my calendar and planning my return visit."
0,"There was a 15 minute wait when we arrived at noon. It was Dan, Kai, and myself. I ordered a delicious cup of freshly squeezed apple juice for Kai and I, coffee also for me, Dan got a regular 'ol iced tea. We ordered our food- I got eggs bacon red potatoes and pancakes, and Dan got their corn beef hash. We ordered pancakes for Kai, and as usual, planned to share our nutritious portion with Kai. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. During the 30-40 minutes (seriously) we were waiting, Kaiden, like all toddlers, had portrayed varied moods and sounds. After people that had come after us were being served, we started getting a little frustrated. This frustration on our part coincided with Kai's worst mood yet of course, so there we were, all hungry, bored, tired and irritated. I think our server serviced us twice during the whole stay: Once when he brought our drinks early on and the other while Kai and Dan were outside waiting for me to finish when he needed to clean up. Never did he stop by to refill our drinks or to even ask if we needed anything at all. Another section's waitress, who noticed that we weren't doing so great (we are generally subtle when we are displeased) asked me if I wanted another fork bc Kai kept dropping silverware on purpose, i politey declined but wanted to give her a hug lol! To Kill more time I began spinning kai around in his high chair since it had wheels and the floor was concrete. I had to keep him from crying bc he was very hungry, bored and tired. Our waiter hadn't offered any crayons and acted as though Kai didn't exist. I presume he doesn't like children but there were a lot of kids there... This place did NOT seem kid friendly! I'm sure it was just our waiter but I guess we'll never know bc that was the first and last time we'll be going there! I asked our waiter for coffee and he said okay but forgot. The food fiiiinally arrived and was served to us by a man we had not yet met, I think he was a bus boy. I asked him for a refill on my coffee but he too had forgotten. During the meal Kaiden was finally quiet but even that couldn't make our waiter stop by. It took me 3 attempts to flag him down and still, I'd politely asked for a refill. The FOOD: Dan said his was bland, not anything great (mind you, this place costs even more than Good Egg & they their bacon is smaller than Good Egg' s). I liked the food, the pancakes were almost as good as Good Egg's. Their food is very simple. At this point Kai was getting loud again but I wasn't quite done with my food and my expensive coffee was still too hot to drink so Dan took Kai to the car to wait for me. Now that the boys were gone the waiter stopped by, but, it was only to drop off the check :-( He did ask me if I wanted boxes though.... But this just made me feel like he wanted me the hell out of there. We could've been out there quicker if we had a waiter that'd existed. I'm a sappy chump though so I still tipped him 20%. The entire breakfast bill including tip was $50.... Yeah... That's expensive for what we could have done at home ourselves and better!!! Save your money and your mood for a few hours by avoiding this place... Or just the waiter... Idk..........."
2,"Ah yes! A new baseball park. I decided to make the trip from Chandler as it is my goal to see all the Spring Training sites. First, the ballpark seems to be out in the middle of no where and I found it slightly strange the seemingly abandoned planes adjacent. \n\nOkay. Traveling in there were slight detour signs and lots of cones. My first impression is that there was a lot of traveling around and that it was so new that they are still working out the \""bugs\"".\n\nParking = $5 = SUCKS!! Normally you can park around stadiums for free if you are crafty, but there didn't seem to be any alternatives close by. As I wanted to get it to the game I just paid it. One thing that was weird about the parking \""lot\"" was that it was grass. I have my thoughts, but sort of cool. \n\nWalking up be prepared to wait in the ticket line. There were only a handful of ticket windows and they were running a tad slow. My friend and I went prepared to buy the lowest ticket, which was $8. We were then told at the counter they were running a outfield reserve for $6. We jumped on it. Our seat were 3 rows back on the 3rd base side. AWESOME! \n\nThe stadium itself was sort of modern looking. Lots of metal and urban looking. I am not sure if I like it, but it was new, big, lots of shade and green! There is a huge grass picnic area with some tables and room to play catch. \n\nFood price is the same, beer prices are the same as everywhere else. Total cost for ticket, beer, parking, soda and hot dog was $24. Not bad. \n\nI will go here again simply for the fact that it is new. Far for me, but could be close to you."
2,"I've heard that this place is going to be taken over by a super-huge Circle K, so I figured I'd better try it while it's still there.  The service was super-fast.  Chips were warm, but the salsa was incredibly bland.  It tasted like plain tomato sauce.  I ordered the #2 combination: a hard taco and 2 cheese enchiladas.  The hard taco was a fatty, generously stuffed with tasty shredded beef, lettuce, tomato, and cheese.  The enchiladas were also generously filled, but the sauce, while tasty, was sparse.  The beans and rice were good.  They have fountain Pepsi, which earned them an extra star.  If you're the type who appreciates quantity over quality, you'll be happy with this place.  For me, the best thing about it was the murals outside.  The waitress gave me a hopeful \""See you next time\"" when I checked out, but I doubt it.  Oh, and no bike rack."
4,"This is a fantastic radio station.  Wake up and listen to news on NPR; fall asleep after a long day at work listening to great jazz.  Plus, the selection of jazz the station plays is fantastic, including a nice variety of jazz vocals, which I've never really heard much on other jazz stations.  I'm not big on modern, free jazz (a la John Coltrane), but I haven't heard much of that on this station, so I'm happy -- this is definitely a 5 star radio station."
2,"Ok I have been to a couple, few in AZ and Cali. Honestly its ok the staff is nice, and place is always clean. I had double double fries and shake. The Double double bread had a weird texture sort of frozen but not. The fries normally I get them cause there really great however I was really shocked no flavor places I have been to sometimes but a spice rub, this was just overly salt and pepper and lightly cooked. the shake was good. There are other really good burger joint out there but worth checking out. While I do admit this was first time being left kinda disappointed in a in and out burger place."
3,"Great place to shop for farm-related items,  western clothing, farm animal feed, etc. Lots of interesting things not normally found at a Walmart. Service is friendly. Seems out of place off Jones Ave from the 95 freeway. Would come back again if in the area."
0,"I thought this place was unimpressive. I don't know if everyone else here just came on a better night with a different staff or what, but this was not the dining experience you all described.  But the worst was the service and attitude of the staff; we were ignored all night. \n\nIt took us a very long time to get seated despite it NOT being full and having a reservation. Not a big deal, but a party of 8 walked in ahead of me and was immediately seated. I guess CPH would make more money off of a larger party, so they were made a priority over someone who had the common sense to make a reservation.\n\nThe server was affable and friendly but would disappear for long stretches of time.  It seemed like everyone working there was more concerned with enforcing the cool hipster vibe than actually doing any work.\n\nI was pretty excited to eat here because they had a great rating. However, my entree was a major disappointed and it took a major dent on my wallet. I will pay anything for good food. However, nothing makes me more angry than overpaying for a crappy entree. I ordered the short ribs based on a recommendation. They were extremely fatty, tough, and nearly burnt. Furthermore, the sides were also a disappointment. I don't think pureed parsnips are particularly expensive, but the portion I received was a joke. I was done with them within 2 bites. What a way to waste my time and money."
4,"The veggie burger here is one of the best i've had at any restaurant.  I love that it had pumpkin in it.  And the whole wheat bun was the best I've had ever.  The sweet potato fries were also great.  It was cool that they had a \""vegas vegan\"" portobello/vegetable option too and a vegan shake with soy whip."
3,"The contemporary and American art sections of this museum are 5 stars, outstanding! I also loved the overall museum layout and architecture."
0,"Overpriced!  I was very surprised at the expensive buffet price.  Around $80 for three of us on a Wednesday night.  Same price for a weekday night as a Friday or Saturday. It was late and we were hungry, and couldn't decide on what we wanted so we gave it a go.  Terrible! Let's start with the salad. It was a little wilted and browning on the edges. (not terrible if you cover with dressing and cheese)\nThere was a cold turkey or chicken (can't remember) dish near the salads that was pretty tender and good. Next stop my favorite Crab Legs! They were terrible! Decent sized, I guess. But they tasted as if they had been slightly opened and submerged in water for several days.  Soggy and tasteless. I've never had soggy crab legs. It was disgusting. Even drowning in butter didn't help this mess. \n\nPrime Rib was ok. No real complaints there. \nHowever, I was really disappointed that they didn't have Banana Cream Pie, that's like a buffet staple. Instead I had a fruit torte and a carrot cup cake.  Both were pretty good. The dessert station definitely looked the best.\n\nThey do have a $10 add on for all you can drink. If you eat here, I think you should go for the all you can drink, because maybe being drunk will help the food taste better.  Also, the soda was terrible. It seemed like the carbonation was out, but they changed it and it was still not good. They also wouldn't give us bottled water \""because we weren't Diamond Plus  members\""  Ridiculous!"
0,"All I can say is \""What the hell\""? I'm so embarrassed by some of the reviews that point out this is the best soul food they ever tasted.   They only could justify that untruth if they did not grow to in a family that cooked with love or never been to  a Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The food and service was horrible.  My guest and I had to ask for silverware, cornbread and refilled....again \""what the hell\"".   I was raised on soul food and know the difference between store bought and homemade.  Oh sure they doctor it up but totally got the prescription wrong.  The food has absolutely no flavor, lacks salt, lowreys seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, mind you these are staples in cooking soul food especially Fried Chicken.  I'm African American so this next statement is not intended to be racist but come on black people, how can you tout yourself as the best Fried Chicken and truly taste horrible.  Again, \""what the hell\"".   It's very easy to make gravy....especially if you have the drippings from your fried chicken so why did this gravy taste like it came from a can.  What surprised me most was to see the tourist eat their food like it was the best food they ever tasted.  Poor visitors, this is not soul food.  Save your 17.00 per plate and drink  and go have Kentucky or better yet Jack in the box.  Yes almost $34 for two plates of chicken and two drinks.  Honestly people \""what the hell\""?"
4,"I would love to see the bar scene  here more vibrant .  Savor already has the perfect bartender, Toni, and amazing drink specials. There is no reason why the bar shouldnt be swarming with yuppies from the Wesley Heights, SouthEnd and 3rd ward neighborhoods! Savor only uses the freshest ingredients and their handcrafted cocktails are standout.\n\nWed: Half price martini's (my fave is the St. Germain: Champagne and St. Germain)\nSat: $4 House Drinks (keep in mind their \""well\"" isnt bottom shelf)\n\nThursday and Friday Savor offers wine and beer drink specials as well."
4,"\""Tammy Wilson-Teeter Saved Our Dog's Life!\""\n\nWhen we adopted our 2 year old Chihuahua/Poodle from a local shelter he was very shy and introverted. So we were very surprised when he showed aggression when we encountered other dogs. We signed him up for obedience training immediately.\n(with another dog training facility)\n\nI left our first session In Tears after being told by the trainer that \""My little dog was Very Aggressive and Beyond Hope!\"" When I arrived home, still crying, my husband went to work looking for a trainer who would work with difficult dogs.\n\nI called Wiggles and Wags Pet Resort the next day. Tammy responded promptly and I was able to bring Baxter in a few days later for a one-on-one appointment with her.\nShe was wonderful with him and happily endured countless questions from me. She gave us homework and told me to call anytime if I had more questions. Being a first time dog owner, I took her up on the offer... Repeatedly ;)\n\nA month after meeting with Tammy we began obedience training at Wiggles and Wags and Baxter passed with flying colors!\n\nWe started bringing him to daycare once a week to help socialize him. Though I felt it would help I was apprehensive about leaving him at first. As promised, Tammy started slowly, introducing him to calm compatible dogs. Now Baxter is easily paired with a variety of breeds and sizes and when we encounter dogs on our walks he cheerfully greets them (most of the time).\nBaxter is an only-pup so he loves to go play with his friends at daycare and he always comes home pooped-out and happy.\n\nI leave him for daycare (and boarding) on a regular basis, confident that he is in good hands. He also gets the full spa treatment at Wiggles and Wags, complete with regular nail filing and teeth brushing. \n\nTammy, Howard and the entire Wiggles and Wags staff are always helpful, positive and welcoming. It is clear that they are all animal lovers!\n\nI've been to a variety of doggie daycare's (while traveling) and Wiggles and Wags is head and shoulders above them all!\n\nI trust them completely with our now 'Polite and Confident' baby boy!"
3,"great services, great people."
4,Food was good and place was clean.
0,"Wow. I am blown away by some of the positive reviews here. I have eaten a lot of Chinese food in my life and the difference between the best and the worst has always been fairly close. Its all generally pretty good. I went to the Golden Harvest 2 weeks ago, while trying to tour local establishments as a new resident. For the first time, I actually had BAD Chinese food. First, my daughter is a big fan of Orange Chicken and the childs menu only had a couple of choices, orange chicken is not one of them. Asked if we could have a childs portion and the waiter (owner?) said no. That's a problem because the adult portion is huge. We should have just left right then and there. Second problem, Sweet & Sour Chicken was terrible. Sauce was terribly watered down and tasteless,  which made the chicken soggy after only 5 mins. Rice was edible, but below par. My father had the beef and broccoli and could only manage about half. I've never seen this guy not finish...he said it was gross. I am a big supporter of local places, but unfortunately I wont be able to come back to the not so golden palace."
4,"Fried pork cutlet is very good and authentic, just like you eat in Japan! The sashimi is decent.  We also try the kushiage. Price is very decent for lunch specials. Prompt service. Clean and comfortable decorations!Good and big portion !!! We definitely will come back to try more foods!"
1,"I've been here for lunch and its good. Not great but good. They have a very limited lunch menu, which is annoying, but the food is good.  Tonight I decided to order the delivery food. It has now been an hour and a half and no food. I have been charged (thank you online banking) but no food. When I called the guy said all the delivery orders have gone out and that it should be here soon.  Soon would have been at 8:30, only an hour after I ordered it. Now we are approaching 9:30, I'm starving and annoyed. I do not recommend ordering the delivery, ever!"
3,"Love this new outside open-air shopping and dining area on the Strip! Adds a great new and clean place to enjoy.  With the super cool High Roller observation wheel! It is located in between The Quad and The Flamingo casinos. And it conveniently has its own parking.\n\n\nThere are many great places to stop.... Sprinkles Cupcakes, Kitson, Brooklyn Bowl (bowling alley, music venue and bar with dining and plenty of live music), and some great restaurants- Chayo, Flour & Barley, Tilted Kily, Yardhouse, The Haute Doggery, and many fun lil shops to visit along the way.\n\nI recommend checking the Linq out- and I do hope this spot continues to grow and offer many new and exciting options!"
0,"After strolling in here to mail a package... I walked out. The line was out the door, the place was \""tore up\"" and it seemed to be staffed with the typical postal employees who make it known that they want a paycheck, but don't want to work... then they are the same to complain that the postal service is losing customers to the competition, and need a government bailout... and cannot shut down on saturday's... poor employees might lose a day of pay for work they actually don't want to do... This office is a clear example of why they need to be replaced by competition... or be run by a business that wants to serve customers."
4,"I came into into Cabo with my fianc\u00e9 and friends. Our server was Yesenia. She was on point with everything, went above and beyond for all of us. From appetizers, to meal, and drinks. She was very attentive and friendly, made us all feel very welcomed and important. The margaritas were very tasty and Sammy  tequila shrimp amazing."
3,"The only other choices you have if you want a sandwich in the area are Quiznos and Subway, so they have an advantage right there, but they're still pretty looks - there's some nice soup options and they have a pretty decent vegetarian menu as well. Some things I like here are the Pesto Chicken Sandwich, the Southwest Sizzler and the Summer Sandwich."
3,"Just like any other pregnant woman this is my go to store. I have gone on weekday mornings, weekday afternoons, and weekends. Let me tell you the best time to go is on weekday mornings any other time of the day is WAY TOO BUSY. I will never go on a weekend ever again unless absolutely necessary. Customer service can be really good or really bad, so like I said go on weekday mornings lol. Also take advantage of their 20% off coupons it can save you a lot when it comes to high ticket items."
0,"The amount of time you have to wait for assistance at the pharmacy is ridiculous. You would think that if there was a line in the drop off section the folks in the pick up section would float over and help.  Nope. Unfortunately I'm stuck here because my insurance dropped Walgreens, which really could have been a great opportunity for them.  Oh well.  20+ minutes and still waiting.  \n\nIf your insurance carries Walgreens, there's an excellent one across the street.  I would highly recommend going there instead.  As for me... I'm going to try the Walgreens on Chandler Blvd next time."
3,"An excellent restaurant for foodies.  The simple salad was not simple at all, the halibut was perfectly cooked and the presentation and extras on the plate enhanced the meal.  The tastes, cotton candy and parting cookie were all nice surprises.  I would definitely return.  The only complaint was it took a long time in between courses and while my company was delightful it made for a long evening."
1,I know I'm in the minority here but I just didn't get it. The sushi was not bad but it was nothing to write home about. I didn't think the conveyer added anything to the experience. But I can see coming here if I worked nearby and had a sushi itch but not a lot of time for lunch.\n\nIf I could I'd go 2.5 stars but not quite a 3 for me. Not bad enough to say avoid at all costs. But just not somewhere I'd go back to except with friends if they wanted to go.
3,I love Dave's Q! In search of some comfort food? This is the place. Bummer they stopped happy houring food. What were you thinking Dave?????
0,"Great location and good atmosphere, but over priced and the food is nothing special at all. The salads looked ok, but the sandwiches are boring - I even had to asked for some kind of dressing for my turkey sandwich after they brought it out dry. I would've rather made lunch at home."
4,"My wife and I travel in and out of Phoenix frequently. After renting cars, driving ourselves and paying for parking, getting friends to take us to the airport, we finally tried ExecuCar. Over the last three years, they have been excellent with on time pick ups, comfortable and safe vehicles, and almost always safe and courteous drivers. We can count on them to get us to the airport and be there to pick us up when we return.  My only wish would be to have a \""frequent flyer\"" kind of sign in program. I usually sign up for a trip on the web, and it doesn't recognize me even though In have used them six or seven times already in the last several months. It would be nice to have all of my pick up and drop off info entered automatically. That being said, it is a reliable and safe transportation option."
3,Best fried clams in Phoenix.
4,Every table filled at 8 pm on a Thursday should begin to tell you about this little hole in the wall Mexican Cocina. Reasonable prices and great service. Fresh chips and salsa was a great way to start. My husband ordered the ribeye and shrimp fajitas and I ordered the shrimp diavlo. Amazing! For dessert we shared a cream filled churro served with ice cream topped with caramel and chocolate sauce. We highly recommend and will be back again soon!
0,"I cant believe! I came here with my friends.someone took a lot of our money. Around 1000$.I asked a security what wrong with a door,its locked last night and opened in the morning.he said he didnt know, he had to check everything and let we know if he know  something.oh my god.they dont have camera and we cant check .i never come back again."
0,"Sat outside , was given water and a menu and never heard from a waiter again. We waited 20 minutes before leaving."
2,"I was so excited to eat here that I headed to Lo Lo's directly from the airport. I had 1 waffle with 2 thighs and I added cornbread and fried okra cuz they looked soooo good, but all of it was just average. That being said the food was hot and fresh and that's important to me, so I would eat here again but I'd try something different. The waitress was nice but it took 20 minutes to be seated and there were empty tables, I'm not sure why we had to wait, but eventually they decided to seat people. There was no toilet paper in any of the stalls which was frustrating and unsanitary. Kinda wish I had tried the Scottsdale location. \n\nMaybe my expectations were too high :/"
3,"This is a nice Starbucks location to walk to, as the parking isn't great, and the lines can be long, depending on when you go. But, the baristas are always friendly, and they have never made a mistake on my drink order!\n\nTry an espresso machiatto over ice in summertime. Yum!"
1,"Not impressed with the food, for the price it should have been better. Orange Chicken was dry and no sauce. The Pad Thai was tasteless. 3 of 4 people in my party could not eat it. The server asked what was wrong and we explained, he took back 3 full plates and never offered to remove them from our bill. Maybe we hit a bad night, doubt we will be back."
1,"Decent grub, pretty poor service (okay it was her first day, she said) and mediocre atmosphere... Thinking you either have to be a true dive Mexican place with awesome food, or hit Cantina instead."
3,"I didn't think I'd like it, but I've eaten there several times and enjoyed everything I've gotten. The straw is good, the new yorker is great, and my favorite is the brisket on sourdough with swiss. The chili is also good, and I hear great things about the burgers. \n\nI agree with Jim W. - fast and quality\n\n(this is not a date place)"
2,Food was just average. Service was very good and attentive.
3,"Can't go wrong with La Bocca!\n\nThe Garden Pizza, is my absolute favorite. Their sangria is yummy, whether its red or white! \n\nThe cucumber water is a little plus for me as well."
1,"I work not far from this place so of course I have eaten there because it is within walking distance. I was not that impressed. Their burgers, I feel, are too greasy and thing. The onion rings are just like any ordinary onion ring. The fries are okay. I have had a salad there and I wasn't that satisfied I ended up not finishing it. \n\nI could do better by going across the street to Carl's Jr."
0,"This hotel is a DUMP..!!! Rooms are the size of broom closets \""Tiny Uncomfortable Double Beds\"" IE \""Two Queens is Considered a Suite\"" and commands a very inflated premium, the linens, sheets towels & blankets are ALL Walmart Quality very poor quality furnishings... Construction everywhere \""Very Noisy\"" at 8am.. Room design is dismal at best curtains don't even close correctly to block out light so @ sun-up its like daytime in your room- very poor design... Everything seems very cheap and SMALL SMALL SMALL unless you want to pay $800+ for a crapy suite... We booked for 4 people 2- Adults 2-Children and were told it was 2-Queens which it WAS NOT..!! They did upgrade us to their version of a \""Mini-Suite\"" which is very far from being any kind of suite at all, very small regular 300sqft hotel room with 2-Queens is apparently a \""Suite\"" in their book, NOT MINE..!! No coffee pot, everything there has a cost $46 a day resort fee yet ITS NOT A RESORT and has literally NO AMENITIES, NO POOL, Everything has a Cost, nothing is included they even charge for the airport shuttle $7 per person which is absurd, taxis are cheaper and on-demand..!! Hotel staff is Rude & unaccommodating at best. they stand around waiting for tips when they don't deserve one at all, you'll wait 15min for a Valet guy OH and that's IF you can even find the Valet/Hotel entrance due to all the construction and lack of any signs or staff to guide you..!! Then they are rude if you don't tip or only give them $2-$3 after waiting 15min for someone when the place is empty not cause they're busy..!! This hotel SUCKS and there are plenty of better options for your money..!! I wouldn't stay there again if they gave me the Presidential Suite Free for a week I'd say NO THANKS..!!!\n\nLocation is OK that's the only good thing I can say, not great though just OK.. OH and the building is hideously UGLY..!!! This is just a quick and very poor remodel job of the Old Debunked \""Imperial Palace\"" \n\nDO NOT STAY HERE...!!!! I've stayed all over Vegas and this is one of the worst places I've stayed yet..!!!\n\nOH and it has MOTEL style Floor A/C units super ghetto, which some genius put literally 6-inches from the bed so it blows freezing air at your face all night and is extremely annoying & uncomfortable as well as loud, so you cannot sleep with any AC on so be prepared to sleep in a Hot Stuffy room unless you want to wake up with a sore throat and frozen like an ice sickle..!!!!! AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE..!!"
1,The burrito was salty and so was the enchilada that my husband had. It looked nice enough inside and our server was very nice but the food didn't do anything for me or my husband. There are better Mexican food places in the area and I suggest you explore them.
2,"I spend more time in Hilton Hotels than my own home which usually leads me to selecting an Embassy, Homewood or Home2 property.  I like the multiple room layout, living and sleeping areas accompanied by a kitchen or bar.\n\nLocation: Not very familiar with Charlotte I had no idea what the location of this property was like.  Had I know I probably wouldn't have given it a chance.  Morning and Evening the streets surrounding the property are beyond capacity.  The traffic is enough to raise your blood pressure and need a drink from the Managers Reception.  The neighborhood is not much better, it's pretty much \""The Hood\"".  Other than the onsite Steak house, which is great, your options for dinning and shopping reflect the economical make-up of the locale.\n\nInterior:  Like all Embassy's the interior Public area is light and airy.  The rooms are outdated and dark but at least they're clean.  The staff is extremely attentive and courteous."
4,"Unfortunately our discovery of Sandwich of Earl was only on day 2 of our Vegas stay. How were we not aware of this 24 hr piece of heaven on our many trips from the casino to our room?! Either way we finally stumbled upon this goodness and then proceeded to eat at least two times a day - either lunch or a snack and then def at 5AM after the clubs. \n\nWe tried the tuna melt (this is the most amazing thing I have ever eaten at a sandwich shop), the caprese sandwich, and I believe the club (?). You know how you eat at a place once and its amazing and you come back and it's not so good? Well it was as good every time as it was the first time. Grab one before you head to the airport for sure!"
4,"Some of the best pho I've ever had. I tried the rare beef pho and would definitely order again. I went with my mom and she had it with chicken, also delicious. All of the add-ins (bean sprouts, cilantro, mint and jalape\u00f1o) were very fresh.  The veggie spring rolls were delightful and came with a tasty peanut sauce. Best of all, the prices are great. $7 for a HUGE bowl of soup.\n\nYes, there is a small language barrier but with a little patience and some gestures, it wasn't an issue. I wouldn't fault them for that, especially when the food is so good.\n\nThe interior is plain, but it's clean. Service was fast and they came by multiple tomes, always keeping our water glasses full. I would definitely go back."
2,"Good food.  They have some interesting and pleasant variations that aren't normally found around here.\nThe beans and salsa are always excellent.\nThe Happy Hour is good, but the service in the bar area is really bad (sat in the bar several times and it is always the same....slow, inattentive and sometimes downright rude!).  Also, as is typical in the Phoenix area, they have two light beers, one wheat beer and a dark beer on tap, but no regular beer (you know, a lager or pilsner!).  What is up with that?  So now you have to either order a bottle or go with a soft drink.\nAll in all, we like the food and go back often.  If the service was better, they would get at least 4 stars and if they had a regular beer on tap, maybe 5!"
1,"Oh my, where do I start? let me say it this way. We tried this place because we thought service was going down in our regular Thai place... well, I will be happy to take the old place slowness anytime, compared to how rude the people at this place were to us.\n\nI honestly am not sure if they know we are paying customers, it was a combination of people with bad manners doing you a favor, and being reprimanded at school.\n\nThe food was good, but not awesome to put up with this. And the worst part is that our party was 5 and they included the gratuity in our check. I think people are entitled to have a bad day but I really could not believe it. I would never tip a penny, but if I ever did, this was the time.\n\nThe coconut soup is good, I think that is the only item I had. So, about 3.5 stars for the food, 1 for the service. \n\nNow, if you are not sensitive as I am, give it a try : P"
1,"I am not a fan of staying on the strip - food, drinks, everything is pricey! I was recently here for a conference, therefore stuck at this hotel. The rooms were clean, beds were comfy, bathroom was spacious, and I had a luxurious view of their HVAC system from my window with glowing green alien lights. If the prices don't drive you crazy here, then the green lights which you can't shut out of your room...that'll do the trick. \n\nThe food choices are OK - if you have $80 to spend on dinner every night..then the restaurants at this hotel are great. If you only have $10...you're in trouble. $10 will get you a cup of coffee and doughnut from Starbucks downstairs. Gambling is obviously high on the strip too.\nThe pool costs money to go to also. I think the only free thing here to do is to visit the Lion Habitat - where poor lions are displayed in faux environments behind glass for you to see. \n\nOverall...if your pockets are dripping with extra change and you don't want to save any $$$ - welcome to MGM!"
3,We ordered a variety of things. Pleasantly surprised by the tacos de cabeza and the mar y tierra sushi roll. Definitely coming back.
1,"Boring big box stores that you can find everywhere else, yet again.  Yawn.  \n\nThumbs up for:\n\n* Dave and Buster's\n* a handful of unique restaurants and independent stores\n* interesting layout of \""The District\"""
0,"I got red high lights here, and every time I sweat or got my hair wet it dripped red on my clothes and towel. I had red high lights done before and this is the first time it happened.  I don't understand all the good reviews here. I looked at many of them and they look like fake ones because they only reviewed one store....?!\n\nI went there at 9am in the morning when they were not busy. But the stylist did not pay attention to the job. As she's cutting my hair, a lady came over and started sweeping the floor, she would use the broom to touch my leg and sweep my leg as well. I am not sure why they do that there.  The hair cut was not that great too. \n\nThis is by far the worst salon experience I have had.\n\nI WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!"
0,Curbside valet is terrible. With the parking deck down its slow and backed up. $18/day for terrible service and a 2 hour wait?! Child please! Not sure what I should've expected though from a bunch of teenagers and a manager who appears to not care. DO  NOT USE. Maybe if we stop using them they'll get the message.
1,"I came here after a news story about how this is the only theater in Las Vegas that has a true IMAX screen.  Sixty feet high instead of the newer smaller so-called imax.  However, they didn't play the movie using the whole screen, so why in the hell did I pay more for a supposed IMAX movie?  \n\nAlso this place was opened in 2001 and it's starting to show it's age.  Some the seats are getting pretty worn out, and the back floor (in my theater) looked like it had never seen a mop.  There are no bathrooms in the halls near the theaters, so keep your ticket and be prepared to walk your ass off and miss quit a bit of your movie if your bladder happens to bust during your show.  Don't even get me started about the rude little kids that work here.  From the ticket booth to the snack bar I was run down by three employees.  (Must have been break time.)  I will never waste my time to drive all the way out here again."
2,"Six months ago I'd have given this place 4 or 5 stars, but things have been changing.\n\nI do like the selection of fresh and ready to eat products, such as heat and eat meals, hummus, and salads. Their meats are good, but too bad they reduced the selection of meats in order to carry a full aisle of beer.\n\nThe half-off items are good, especially the two-serving breads. Prices are reasonable, and selection is generally good for my needs. I do wish they would allow me to pick my own vegetables (I don't need 4 sweet potatoes or 6 onions, only one). \n\nThe service is on the down-swing, unfortunately. It used to be easy to find an employee, but it's getting harder. Even the free samples, which used to be a fantastic way to try a Fresh & Easy brand product, are often missing or the same thing over and over. This store is barely a year old, and already it's lost its appeal."
3,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while. I think it was Dan T's former favorite Thai place. Thanks to Jade W's UYE, I finally got to try it out with a large group of Yelpers. I'm glad because it's certainly not in my part of town.\n\nSo what's the verdict? It was good, but I didn't find any compelling reason to drive back there. The one dish that stood out was the Green Curry. I'm not sure why, but it had a unique flavor and was absolutely delicious. That is the reason I'm handing out four stars.\n\nLike I said, the rest of the food was good too. We all ordered individually, but I got to try pretty much everyone's dishes. My go-to dish, Panang Curry, had good flavor. I still prefer Archi's, of course.\n\nFor such a large group, the owners did well in serving us. The food came out staggered, which is understandable. Overall, we had a great time and Thai Grill gets my seal of approval."
4,"4.5 stars\nVery good pizza by the slice and great service and people! Quick, inexpensive, and tasty meal."
4,"This is the closest TJ's to me. The people are always friendly as usual with allTrader Joes stores. I regularly go on Sunday nights super busy, I buy the pre-made salads for my weekday lunches. I am a vegetarian so my favorites are Greek, Shrimp and southwest Yummy!\n\nWine lovers go here for great deals on good wine, Some of my favorites I can only get here, organic Well Red, Zarafa Pinotage, the Sangiovese  for under 3 bucks. cant be em. \n\nFrozen veggies are a good deal and the meatless meatballs soo good with spaghetti squash and or just plain BBQ sauce. \n\nAlso buy the hummus Eggplant or roasted red pepper.\n\nProduce is a little pricy. so I buy elsewhere like Sprouts or Sunflower. \n\nCant go wrong with free samples and wine tastings daily."
1,"This review is by default getting 2 stars.  The Frozen Hot Chocolate should get like a 3-4 stars but I can't do it.\n\nMust warn people of the horrible service here... at least the outdoor patio.  I get it, sort of, that it was Labor Day weekend.  But seriously it should NEVER take 15 minutes to get a glass of water.  When its 95 outside you seriously should try and keep your customers happy.  I guess they do not want any repeat business.\n\nI believe the table we were sat next to left in the middle of there lunch because of the service.\nEasy to leave this place w/o paying which I kind of felt like doing.\nSundae we order came out super melted and all over the place.  We ate a few bites & the FHC we shared was good but not to die for that I was thinking it might be.\nMaybe my expectations were to high.\nOh I put moderate pricing that is if you share... I would say more on the pricey side if your eating your own meal w/drinks.  \n\nMay try to have a FHC @ the window again but will definitely not be dining at this restaurant again, ever! \n~With so many other places in Vegas there is no reason to have bad service twice."
2,"Another pizza joint that I wanted to love and another meh.  I have upgraded from a Meh to an A-OK out of charity.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was WOW either.\n\nOn my continued quest to find a white pizza that I love, I decided to try Libretto's after attending a Yelp Elite event that I didn't eat at because I arrived late, after already eating.  Everyone there had nothing but good things to say about the food, so I put Libretto's on my list.  \n\nWhile running errands today, I ended up on this side of town.  In Ballantyne shopping center, at the corner of Johnston/521 and Ballantyne Commons Pkwy, there is plenty of parking at the end that Libretto's is located at.  Arriving around 4:00 pm, there were a couple of people at the bar, but other than that, the place was empty.  A few folks came in and out retrieving takeout orders.  There is outdoor seating, indoor seating at bar-looking wooden tables and chairs and then a back area with tables cloths and a more formal setting.  There are 4 TV's in the bar area and they were tuned to golf on my visit.\n\nThe hostess, who was also my waitress, was pleasant.  I could have done without the singing/yelling from the kitchen area.  It's a mostly open floor plan so noise carries.  Even with practically no one in the restaurant (off hours on Father's Day), there was a hum to the place that made it rather loud.\n\nI ordered a Diet Coke and a 10\"" Pizza Bianca (white pizza) which totaled just under $13.  The crust was thin and crisp (too hard for my liking, but that is a personal preference) but didn't have much flavor, it also had a burned taste to me, though it was only black in a couple of places.  This may be exactly how it is meant to be, as some folks may like it, but I didn't care for it.  The ricotta for the white pizza was in blobs on the pizza.  While the ricotta was smooth instead of curds, the pizza was zzzzzzzzzz.  White pizza has to have an extra effort put into it since there is no sauce and I didn't care for this.\n\nI shall continue my hunt for a delicious white pizza in Charlotte - so far, Hawthorne's holds the crown for the best to me."
4,"I had a fantastic time, didn't wait long to get in, the staff was friendly, everyone from the hosts to the bartenders to security. The club is gorgeous and the various rooms make it easy to change ambience. Mary is one of the best hosts I've had, she took care of me and made sure me and my party were taken care of. Highly recommend Hakkasan to anyone that wants the Vegas nightlife experience."
1,"Coming to a Store near you; \""Close Encounter of the Zombie Kind.\"" The check out clerks at this location have the worst attitude zombies I have ever encountered., not to mention, the whole foods market, charges twice or three times the money for the same produce elsewhere. When you are committing highway robbery at least have the toll collectors smile...to soften the shock  ( Ben 'Bugsy' Siegel:  Bend your knees, Harry:...Bend my knees?.. Ben:.. When you are jumping off a train, bend your knees- to soften the impact.  Harry: ..Bend my Knees..sure thing Ben ! )\n\nLas Vegas, is known as a service town and you automatically expect  the check out people are nice and courteous but not here (we need some research into this abnormal social behavior)  Greeting is a luxury they can't  afford. and they don't seem to care if you buy or drop dead as long as you are buying enough groceries to feed Nicaragua or enough to choke your dog with organic pet food.(in which case you can expect a little crack in their veneer.)\n\nThe place is clean and the variety is admirable, I come here for cooking wine like Madeira and Marsala wine (also don't believe the uninformed chefs, who tell you that you can use regular wine for cooking which is about 6% alcohol but the cooking wine like Marsala wine from North of Sicily has 18% alcohol-and it is dry wine ideal for cooking,) which you cannot get anywhere, but rest of the products you can get in any ethnic grocery store for lot less and smiling check out clerks as part of the package.. Sometimes I wonder if stepped into a fantasy land called  \""Zombies in the Whole Food Wonderland\"" where alien zombies are not supposed to be kind or courteous to the human kind."
3,"This is not listed as one of the glamorous hotels in Vegas, but it is worthy of a stay.  Harrah's is in a great location right in the heart of the strip. It is within walking distance of all of the fancy hotels and casinos and is typically a fraction of the cost. The rooms are big and comfortable. It is also a convenient stop for the monorail. \n\nThe casino itself is something to be desired, but you are never a 5-minute walk from a casino in Vegas."

4,A sports fans dream!!!!! Such a fabulous place to watch football! Sunday Funday for sure! Tons of screens all around and a variety of seating options. You can belly up to the bar or reserve VIP booths or stadium seating or what we did was reserve a table of 11. Of course in true Vegas fashion to do anything cool we had to spend a minimum of $50 each on food and drink to stay for a 4 hour time slot. They cater to the different times the games play. \nWe all wore our favorite team jerseys as we were having a girls weekend in Vegas and girls flew in from all over. It was a perfect Sunday in Vegas. The good was good I had the gush and chips yum perfect hangover food lol
0,"Horrible food! They reheat their meats by adding oil. The guy at the counter never said hello, thank you or smiled once. After we sat down the guy at the counter and one of the guys in the back started wrestling around on the floor. A la lucha libre. The salsa bar was nasty and dirty.\nSuper burrito is so much better."
2,"I think this deserves 3.5 stars & maybe more esp since I'm not a fan of fried food so I didn't try any.  That may be a mortal sin at this place but they still offer prime rib which I had medium rare with asparagus & spinach.  My hubs had the ribs with a dinner salad & side mushrooms.  Surprisingly, we went in at 5pm & the lot was full & it was essentially crowded due to (probably) the east coasters eating early since it's really 8 pm for them.  By 6pm, some were done & had left & even more couples were arriving for dinner.  I think we'll be back since Herb, our waiter had even mentioned that happy hour is 2-7 with 1/2 price drinks & apps so how could you go wrong?"
4,Great finds for next to nothing. If you are looking for a good deal on designer clothes and shoes this is a great place to look. It can get a little cramped in the isles but not a huge issue.
2,About as average as you can get. It's probably the closest Chinese place you can get to CMU or even Pitt otherwise. Good for takeout or even for groups. The food is okay ... not particularly mind-blowing but also not bad either. Standard Chinese fare ... the Meal Specials are soft on most wallets.
0,"This used bookstore is impossible to navigate, and even as an experienced thrift shopper, I really cannot stand it. The books are in piles on the floor throughout the store, and there are no section headings or any kind of categorizing system, whatsoever.\n\nGranted, for any good thrifting experience, you have to take your time and really hunt for a bargain. However, there are no bargains to be had hear. Despite the twin cities of Urbana-Champaign being a college town and bursting at the seams with academics, it does not seem that many sell their used or unwanted texts here. There is just a lot of nonsense between these stacks. This also suggests to me that perhaps they do not buy books for reasonable amounts, while I would say that comparably they overcharge for the generally very damaged fare.\n\nIf you are looking to buy or sell used books in the Urbana-Champaign area, I would highly recommend the Jane Addams Book Shop (www.janeaddamsbooks.com). They have a huge selection--three whole floors--which are clearly organized, provides an extensive leisure and academic assortment, and everything is a bargain buy. This is all not to mention the extremely helpful service of the new ownership, something that cannot be said of Priceless Books."
1,"I went on my lunch break and had the special 4.99 two entree special. Initially, I was impressed by their Salt and Pepper Chicken. Unfortunately, I tried the Chow Mein, Fried Rice, and Orange Chicken and was disappointed. The breading on the orange chicken was excessive. \n\nIt feels like more of a burger spot, because of the seating and d\u00e9cor. I didn't feel like I was in a restaurant that serves Chinese food. I might go again to try other entrees, but no future visits planned for the near future."
4,"Came here for happy hour and I had a good experience! It was my first time going here with a few of my girlfriends and it was fantastic! Buy the first drink, get the second drink for free! We shared the White Gummi and this other drink with banana in it! They were in goblets and there were nine shots in each goblet. White Gummi was my favorite drink. It had gummy worms and dry smoking ice which looked cool. Me and my girls got a good buzz from the drinks. The bartenders were so nice and fun to talk to! We enjoyed walking down the strip afterwards. Good times!"
1,"Hey have you heard have you heard that White Rabbit opened a brick and mortar location right here in Vegas? Where you say? Right off Jones between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn, the same plaza as 168 market.\n\nI've only had White Rabbit candy. Anything from this White Rabbit or the food truck prior to this? Nope, but I've heard a lot of great things about them. They do have a good fan base a lot of people like them. They may have been featured in some tv show or newspaper/magazine. Honestly I don't even know, just heard their a foodtruck and that people like them. I liked their customer service.\n\nA group from work went here after having heard they opened. I told the staff that we've never had them and wanted something they were known for or was fans raved about. The sisig was suggested without hesitation. So I was hoping it was gonna be amazing. No one in the group liked it.  It was pretty bad that I had to eat sisig somewhere else to satisfy my craving. It was pretty dry and didn't taste right at some parts, mushy at others. It remembered me of a overcooked mixture of canned corned beef and some other items. What I got, the rice bowl combo with drink was about $8-9 food truck size and price, wasn't filling. \n\nI probably wouldn't go back. But at least they have other items other than sisig and have a fan base."
0,"These jerks towed my car when we were eating at the brass rail on 40th st and Thomas.....there were no signs that said \""NO RESTURANT PARKING\""   we have been eating at the brass rail for years and parked there numerous times.  the tow truck driver had to have been sitting in the parking lot, because they towed the car 3 minutes after we parked.  BULLSHIT!   These guys should be out of business!!!"
2,I enjoy this Starbucks and believe me all of them are different. Love how they make chi tea lattes here but their service is just so so sometimes I prefer the drive through at this one.
3,"Excellent food and service! I have been here twice so far, and both times have been fantastic. Food is extremely fresh tasting and cooked with skill. The small grievance I have is that the second time I went, they were out of the roast chicken I really wanted to try. However, it's worth mentioning I went at 8 on a wednesday. Considering that, I don't hold too much against them. So I had the paella instead, and am glad I did. It says \""good for two\"" on the menu, but I ate the whole thing myself. I will definitely be back."
0,I have to say they gave me the worst haircut I have ever had. I will never go there again.
3,"Yes it is \""gimmicky\"".. isn't that what Vegas is all about?  It is really beautiful, and a fun place to see and visit.  We perused all 3 levels, settled in at the top (it was 2 in the afternoon, so \""ambience\"" did not matter so much to us at this point).  Temps outside at 117 deg. F., so we were hot and thirsty.\n\nTodd was our bartender, and did an excellent job of attending to our needs.  My hubs ordered a Mojito, which he declared to be the \""best I've ever had\"".  \n\nI actually only drank Seven-Up.. was too hung over and hot for anything else.  But loved visiting here, really spectacular."
3,"Ok, most of these stars simply go to the fact that these guys took a theme and ran with it. Ran like a tiger beast! And while kitchy/quirky/weird usually doesn't get me going, my time has been pretty enjoyable. I dig the vibe. \n\nI don't dig that it's cash only and there's no ATM machine, and the closest is across the street, but other than that, it's a fun place to meet someone for happy hour, though I can't imagine ending my night here or staying more than an hour or so."
0,walked over there for dinner saturday night and they were closed!
2,I love America's Taco Shop.  I only gave this location 3 stars due to lack of service. I am used to ATS taking pride in their service.  You can tell this location is a franchise.
3,"Came here on a Friday night and the girls got in for free!\n\nBut when we came in, it was still pretty empty and not many people were dancing. The music was kinda ehh at first but it got progressively better throughout the night. The entire atmosphere of the club definitely was beautiful, especially the outdoor area by the pool. \n\nWhat I didn't like though was there's really nowhere to sit unless you get bottle service. And there's no big dance floor! You just have to dance in the small spaces between the bar and the gogo dancer stages. \n\nIn my opinion, Surrender is just alriiiiight. Worth checking out once for sure, but XS is definitely the best!"
1,"My family and I went here on a recent Wednesday night to redeem our $35 groupon.  There were a lot of other \""Grouponites\"" dining and the restaurant clearly was not prepared for the crowd.  There was no hostess up front and we waited about 5 min. before someone came to seat us.  We were told that we could pick from a booth and someone would bring our menus.  We sat down and got our menus when they told us our server would be right with us.  A server approached our table and said, \""I'm here to get your drink order and your server will be right with you\"".  So, apparently she was not the designated server for our table but she came back with our drinks and we were ready to order so she took our order and ended up becoming our server.  Number one pet peeve of ours is when we order an appetizer and it comes out at the same time as our food.  This happened.  My husband ordered wings and a Dip and I ordered the blackened tilapia sandwich.  My two kids split a kids meal.  My fish sandwich was far from blackened. It appeared to be thawed out and thrown on a grill for about 2 minutes and put on a sub roll that was not toasted or anything. It ended up being soggy.  I did not get the lettuce, tomato and onion as the menu described.  I waited for about 5 minutes to flag someone down because I didn't want to start eating it until I had dressed it up with the tomato, lettuce and onion.  So, the manager came by and got it for me.  My husband had way too much food and did not finish it.  The dip was mediocre at best but he did say the crispy chicken wings were good.  I just cannot believe my fish sandwich came out soggy on an untoasted roll that appeared to be a French's roll from the grocery store.  I would not be surprised if that fish was previously frozen and thawed in a microwave.  Our server (who was probably a hostess or food runner) was doing several other jobs was probably assigned to our table because the regular server in that station was slammed.  Isn't the whole point of Groupons to intice new customers and hope for repeat business? Well, that won't be the case with us.  Everyone was super friendly and apologetic for the wait, etc. but seriously, if you are a restaurant owner and considering a Groupon, please be prepared for the crowd."
0,"Service was mediocre at best. Food was incredibly poor quality: literally had a freezing cold French fry served to me. The only thing they have going for them is good beer selection. Thus, one star for the beer."
2,"The zoo is definitely small, but it is free and their is a good selection of animals. Don't expect this to be the pride of the United States, but if you or a person you know is into animals, check out the zoo."
0,"Repulsive. It's plain white rice with Teriyaki sauce and some disgusting bits of chicken. I made the mistake of not ordering the bowl \""white meat only\"" and ended up with a bowl of fat, gristle, skin, cartilage, and odd-tasting bits that I couldn't identify. This is a $6 bowl of disgusting crap. I'm told that the \""white meat only\"" option is important. I don't care. Nobody should serve that, ever. \n\nIf you want a decent teriyaki bowl that won't make you want to vomit, go to Costco and get their frozen bowls. I can't remember the brand, but it's got veggies, delicious white meat (with a lot of flavor), rice, and sauce. It comes out to about $1.30 per bowl. \n\nI'm eager to finish this review so that I can stop thinking about that disgusting bowl. So that's all."
2,"Ate here with friend, while in Arizona to judge horse show.  Noticed that many exhibitors were also here.  Smelled great--waiter very attentive-wait maybe 10 minutes, on a Friday night.\nGood bread and olive oil escarpeta-parmesan.  I had lemonade, she had iced tea-OK.  Had whitefish that was really good.  She had chicken w/proscutto & cheese-center was a bit raw--was taken away and re-cooked.  Chef came out and was polite, but dancing---\nHad it not been for that, would be  4 stars--would go there again"
4,"The Keg Steakhouse and Bar was a pleasant surprise!  I was looking for somewhere to meet my friend after work, and happened upon The Keg at Tempe Marketplace.  I love the dark atmosphere inside, and there is also the option of a very comfortable and inviting outdoor patio.  The service was great, the servers were friendly and conversational, and the food was to die for!.  My friend and I ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops and the warm goat cheese rolled in almonds and served with tomato basil salsa.  Both were delicious, but the goat cheese and salsa blew me away!  In addition, for those who drink they have an extensive (and reasonably priced) drink menu, with some unique and interesting concoctions (some day I'll have to try a martini with egg white froth), and wine by the glass is half price during happy hour.  I enjoyed a lovely white zin in the \""Keg size\"" 9 oz glass for only $4.00!  All in all, it was a very pleasant and sophisticated atmosphere, the food was great, and the prices were in line with your typical TGI Friday's or Applebee's, both of which pale by comparison.  Actually, they more than pale, they turn ghastly white and keel over from the pressure of even trying to come close to comparing...The Keg Steakhouse and Bar FTW!"
1,"Food was alright, but sub-par, even for bar food. Fish n chips was below average. Service was reasonable. Wife didn't care for pizza. Would not likely go back."
3,This review is for the banana cream pie we picked up to bring to a picnic today. We were pretty skeptical of going after seeing all the awful reviews but took a chance. My boyfriend and I miss the banana cream pie we used to pick up from Marie calendars in California and hoped this would be a similar substitute. The lady that rung me up was so friendly and reassured me the pie would be great. It turns out we had a hit item at the picnic we went to. Everyone kept talking about the pie as we were making our way through the savory main dishes. And boy did it disappear fast. The pie was just as delicious as Marie's. Still skeptical on dining in though...
1,"Found this place at restaurant.com where they Jade house that claimed they were voted one of the top 100 Chinese restaurants in the country according to _____ .    \n\nThe decor is rundown and had a layer of grime and dirt.  The bathroom faucets were broken and the health grade was nowhere to be found.\n\nHaving a restaurant.com coupon here guarantees bad service and its not the language barrier.  I asked for hot tea and brown rice and didn't get what I asked for.  A couple of families that came in 15 minutes to half an hour after us were served first.\n\nReally disappointed by the food.  It was typical, greasy fare.  I would be willing to tolerate the service if the food was exceptional.  Oh well..."
2,"I always end up eating at this Subway.  I really like my chicken teriyaki salads.  However, some of the workers are really... interesting people.  There is an older man who literally takes ten minutes to make a salad or sandwich because he doesn't understand English very well.  Then there's another young guy who doesn't listen and puts the wrong things on the sandwich (even if you repeat the same word over and over... if I say \""pickles... pickles... PICKLES!\"", I probably want pickles).\n\nStill, this is down the street from my apartment.  It's clean enough.  The service is lacking, but not enough for me to avoid the place.  Whatever.  It's Subway.  If I want a gourmet meal, I'll go elsewhere."
0,RUDE!!!!! this guy never showed up for our appointment!!! Seriously how can he be such a badddd businessman...not even a callback to me to apologize nor did he call the receptionist back! Won't b getting my business nor my 50 friends I always refer! Glad u didnt get my awesome tip: YOU SUCK DOUCHBAG !!!!!!
3,The apps are awesome...\nThe menu is somewhat hard to read.\nBoth worth it...\n\nIt is very ... very hard to find to find.
3,"We came for lunch while waiting for check in. We are trying out a vegan diet and our waitress was extremely accommodating. We got the Fajitas and the Black Bean Burger and she made sure they removed all hidden butter/cheese/etc. The meals were good: nothing too fancy - delicious pub food. It's expensive, but it's Vegas so that's not surprising. \n\nWe came a second time around 1 am on a weeknight and were surprised to see that they still served food. Get the fries!"
4,"The sushi is the best. Try the tuna poki, spicy rainbow and yum yum crispy tuna"
4,"Lovely interior, just enough comfort-to-hip ratio. Went there for the first time Monday night got 4 empanadas and a desert for take out. The food was delicious!!! and we will be going there to eat in next time. As I was waiting for my food I noticed that the staff were engaged and informative and customers were enjoying the atmosphere as much as the food.\nGo there to eat and hang out it will make a wonderful evening. Ps the food is mostly somewhat Puerto Rican & Caribbean style -ish and tastes just like you hope it will."
3,"Incredibly friendly, I had 2 others in front of me and was out by about 15-20 minutes so not slow. Just went in for an oil change. They arent expensive and they have different levels of oil changes depending on the car. From $15 to $50. Mine was $22. While I was there one guy pulled me to my car and let me know my battery was going and should be replaced. A lot of places like this try to sell you more things and I feel its what he was trying to do which is why I gave it 4 stars."
1,"I really just can't get it up for this place.  It wasn't horrible, but was also nothing exciting.\nIt is a lovely place.  I have walked past it a few times and admired its beauty.  It is clean, and crisp and bright. Really really nice.  \nAlso small.  Not good for groups at all.  \n\nThe drinks were really good too.  I'll give 'em that for sure.\n\nUnfortunately the food just doesn't live up to the decor.\nI had the Oriental grilled tuna and my husband had the burger au poirve.  Both were completely boring.  \nThe fish was grilled fine... the sides were completely lack luster... the only thing with any hint of flavor on my plate was the wasabi.  I like it hot man, but that green devil paste was (to my complete and utter shock) the hottest wasabi I have had.\nI kept trying to liven up the blandness of my dish with the hell fire paste, but alas it was either too little and drowned out by the soy, or the equivalent of 100 tiny Chuck Norris' round house kicking my sinuses.\nI could have used little red riding hood to sniff out that just right amount she is so fond of.  \n\nMy husband was equally unimpressed.\nI just don't see a second trip in our future."
2,"Should be 2.5 stars...\nTheir chips and salsa, delish. I die. every time.\nThe pollo queso something something...yummmm, so greasy and cheesy and spicy and chickeny and fried \n$4 dollar margaritas? ok!\nThe food here is typical yummy greasy Arizona Mexican food. It's nothing extraordinary, but it isn't terrible. What's terrible about this place is the service. Yikes!\nEvery time I come here I am first ignored by the depressed 19 year old side bang lip pierced hostess. She really never makes an effort to say hello. I feel I need to overcompensate for the brattiness she exudes by being overly nice. Hello? I'm on the opposite side of the hostess podium, do your job biotch. \nWe are often sat at some odd random table, on our most recent visit being one with 2 or so extra chairs, that also doubled as the iced tea, water, and to go container station. I think it's best if you come here with large groups for this reason. They seem to reserve all the \""nice\"" tables for them.\nOur waitress is usually a moody 40 something woman, that acts like everything she does for you is a favor. Literally, the waiters and waitresses here don't even bring your food, drinks, take your plates, etc. Now the men that do all this, I like. They're friendly, and helpful!\nI think it's a large extended family that still owns and operates this place. Which is most likely why the service sucks so much. \nI still occasionally eat here, as my boyfriend loves the food, but the service needs some upgrading. If this wasn't such a tourist trap this place would have gone out of business long long ago"
0,It's tough living in Charlotte. If you have to check a bag it usually takes the bag longer to make it from the airplane to baggage claim than it takes to fly it from MEM to CLT - must be the highly efficient union labor...
4,Great food an great service.  Had the meatball sub  and ny friend had the bolognese pasta.  And Danielle was great!
3,"I love this place, they are fast and they do a good job. The staff is really nice. Yes, it is true that they want to sell you every product and promo when you are there, but you can just say that you are not interested.\nI really recommend EWC!!!"
1,"The Blackbird is new and seems to be popular, but it's not somewhere I could recommend to eat, based on our recent visit. The burger was really poor. Tollcross has lots of good dining options, so this place is for pre- or post-prandial drinks, only.\n\nOverall, we said: \""while the Blackbird is quite a smart place, and I thought the service rather good, it needs to get to work on improving its menu. The burger I had was one of the saddest I've tried, to date. It was way too lean, and pretty much just a waste of good beef. As it stands, I'd say come for drinks, but eat elsewhere.\"""
2,"I'm not really sure how to rate the buffet at The Bellagio. It's good quality, but if you don't like seafood you are having your options cut down significantly and your enjoyment will largely depend on what interests you out of a limited selection. Sometimes it's OK, sometimes I end up eating the same 2 or 3 things and filling up on the very good desserts.\n\nThe non seafood eater is simply subsidizing everyone else at this expensive buffet. Not only is there a dedicated section full of fish and other seafood, the Asian food is strongly fish themed. \n\nSeafood lovers rejoice. Seafood haters are probably better off at a Station Casino."
4,"Every time we visit Arizona we always go to Tom's. There Italian Beef is fantastic with peppers and grilled onions, makes my mouth water just thinking about it. We also had there Vienna hotdogs there great as well."
3,"Ok, about a month ago I came across a picture of a new food truck posted by Local Foodnik Joel LaTondress, known to the Phoenix food community and the twitterverse as @AZHotdish.  Not often does a simple picture cause so much commotion, but since the snapshot in question was of a food truck focused on Northeastern seaside cuisine namely Lobster rolls and other such briny delicacies, foodies began buzzing, posting queries clamoring for further details.  Further information about where to find this culinary treasure or whether it actually existed was thin and the discussion seemed to end.\n\nA quick check of the URL www.mainelobsterlady.com got me a contact number to call which led to a rather pleasant conversation and information as to scheduled appearances.  Today, after almost a month of waiting, I went into stealth mode to get into the Arabian Horse Show (who cares about the horses when there's lobster to eat?) and get myself a lobster roll.\n\nThe Maine Lobster Lady operates out of a very tidy, well equipped trailer.  As you approach you can almost smell the salt air and then theres the menu... Two different styles of Lobster roll, shrimp puffs and lobster chowder to name a few.  Barely able to control my glee, I ordered a tradiditonal lobster roll and an order of shrimp puffs.\n\nServed on a hot, butter grilled roll sat easily a half pound of some of the best prepared, most succulent lobster i've ever eaten.  This sandwich is the epitome of simplicity with the barest hint of lemon aioli, chunky lobster tail and claw meat and a buttery sweet roll. I cant even begin to describe how tasty this sandwich was and the $18 price was well worth it.\n\nTo accompany my sandwich were an order of \""shrimp puffs\"" ($8.50), think of hushpuppies stuffed with succulent bay shrimp, a crunchy exterior and soft, well seasoned, piping hot interior.  Oh yeah, this was just melt in your mouth delicious when dipped in creamy tartar sauce.\n\nI dont know if you have any interest in horses but if you value your tastebuds and the happiness of your belly, get out to the horse show or find the Maine Lobster Lady at one of her other events this spring and indulge, If you arent able to find her, stay tuned as I eat my way through her menu.  You may live vicariously through my culinary adventures!"
2,"My lemon ricotta and apple cinnamon pancakes were AMAZING, but the service was horrible.  Very very slow, and maybe the waitress was not experienced enough to figure out what I need before I asked for it.  For example, she sat my group which was a table of 3, and only had one menu for about 5 minutes before she brought out another one.  Also only had two sets of utensils before I asked for another setting.  5 minutes after she delivered my pancakes, I had to ask for syrup.  If the service was better, I would have rated this restaurant with a 4.  Maybe next time."
3,"After having a bad experience at the paris buffet, we decide to go walk off all the unnecessary calories off by going to the new Cosmopolitan hotel and see all the shiny bling and art. \nIt was indeed impressive. After a brisk walk through long open hallways and a cluster of 5 foot tall dog statues pointed towards each other, then a giant high heel we came across the Wicked Spoon buffet. Even though were we were full we wanted to do  walk through. We were impressed by the tapas style method of serving and the food looked good as well. Then we passed by the dessert section which is FULL of fudge, pastries,  chocolate covered crab apples and strawberries, ice cream and gelato, and fresh berries ( you can tell i have a major sweet tooth) that was the point we realized we made a huge mistake by eating at the paris and were planning a return trip there to actually try the food that was making our mouths water.\nFast forward 2 days, we arrived there at 5pm for sunday brunch which was reasonably priced at $27.\nAmbiance was very comfortable and the decor was cool. luckily we were seated next to the food since we made many trips back n forth seeing how you can only fit 3 small (2-4 bite) plates onto the normal plate you carry. Ii tried 3 different salads which were all fresh and yummy.\nTruffle oil infused potatoes were nothing to write about. they love lamb at this buffet because there were 3 different dishes there, not a huge fan of lamb but they were ok as well.\nI didnt expect much from buffet sushi but it was actually surprisingly good since it was being prepared fresh constantly by the chef on site. There was a Pho station which was nice too, you don't usually see these at buffets. \nI also liked the brussels sprouts, and fingerling potatoes, red wine mushrooms and the pork bun.\nKinda dissapointed that you have to pay $15 extra for king crab legs, i opted out since i wanted to focus on the regular menu items there.\nthey did serve 2 kinds of king crab, (not legs) one in a butter sauce and the other in a bernaise sauce. both were overcooked and rubbery.\nI even tried the new batches they brought out to find the same result :(\nI didnt try the meat carving stations.\nDessert did not dissapoint though, berries cherries all juicy and sweet.\nHuge tasty chocolate strawberries, great Gelato, i tries the pistachio and salty peanut flavors.\n\nI'd go back for sure.\n\nCurrently the M is my favorite buffet but this may take that spot.\n\nBTW if youve got $90 to spend per person check out the sterling buffet at the Ballys! only open 1 day a week but its the Ultimate. top notch shit there"
1,"Not a fan. This place has tons of potential, but looks as though the owners ran out of money. They have an awesome outdoor beach element, but I have been there 3 times and never seen it used! The place is also huge, but rather empty on most occasions and somehow the place is super smokey even when only a few people are present. The girl's restroom is also far from up to par.\n\nThe plus side would be if you are looking to play a good game of darts or pool the area is almost always up for grabs."
3,"Last night was the fourth time for us to go to Haciendas. This time we felt good enough to bring some good friends in from Seattle. We took advantage of their Happy Hour and sat on the patio. Good beer prices,  the only down side was they didn't have oranges for our Blue Moons.......by the second round they came through with them. Nice touch! We tried almost every app on the menus and loved them all and you can't beat the HH prices @ $4 each. The nachos were a hit with all of us and the chicken street tacos were the favorite. Love this place because the HH is great and you cant beat the prices.......and its so close we could walk if we wanted. Happy to see this new place open and hope it stays for years to come. Oh and the service was good as well. Would have given 5 stars but on the first few visits we had a hard time getting quick service on the patio. \n\nOne of our new favorite places in Scottsdale"
4,"New Location, same great food (with a couple menu changes). The new spot is right next to the movie theater on Sahara and Ft. Apache. It looks to be larger than their original spot but only half of the dining room was being used the night I went. \n\nThe wife went with the kiki burger -- always a good choice. New to the menu (at least since the last time I went to Bachi Burger) is their lobster roll ($15). It's two mini buns stuffed with lobster mixed with fennel and a curry spiced aioli with lettuce. It may not be a traditional lobster roll flavor, but the curry creates a unique and tasty asian-inspired version of this classic. The freshly fried taro chips that accompany the dish were delicious as well.\n\nService was good, especially considering that the place just opened earlier this week. Although it was odd that my wife's burger came out several minutes before my food or our son's food did. But, I'm sure minor issues like that will improve over time.\n\n4.5 Stars"
2,"Tao restaurant is like PF Chang's with tighter skirts, louder music and higher prices. (In case you didn't pick up on it - I didn't use PF Chang's as a positive reference). \n\nI went with the fixed price menu and had the salmon which was okay. Definitely had better for half the price. \n\nI did REALLY like their filet mignon. We subbed out the wasabi that it comes with but it was a damn good filet mignon. \n\nI know Tao nightclub is upstairs but DAMN it was loud in the restaurant and I'm one of those people who always tell others to relax when they say a place is too loud. It really was way too loud. \n\nFixed price menu is $55. \n\nHonestly, it was only worth it so we could get stamped to get into the nightclub."
2,"The price is so huge difference, I found something so cheap like 20$ next to sth 1200$... It's a little weird for me, kind of not sure about the real value of all the clothes. Hope they can sort it in a better way. Most of the clothes are cheaper end."
1,"the wait was long. ordered the lobster omelette and crabcake something. wow, don't even remember, that's not a good sign. I'm particular about my crabcakes. Not too much bread crumbs, that's good, but the crab was all shredded. I'm looking for lumps! Had a mimosa, that they forgot. I don't think i need to go back ;/"
1,Service is ok!!!! Nothing good.... Food is just ok nothing special... I won't come again.
0,"I'm all for makeup stores and like to look through each and every product to see which would be the best color for me, etc. and since Sunday's are the best time for me to go I just brought my debit card in, that was all! No purse and I was just wearing a tank top and jeans. I asked 3 employees for advice & 2 of them were rude and no help at all telling me very vague advice but the 3rd girl really helped me and genuinely cared what I needed help with. So I carried on looking at eye shadows and I saw the manager eyeing me down and sending her associates to help as if I was stealing! Like hello I don't even have a purse what am I gonna take? Eventually when I reached a cashier with a couple of eyeshadows and hair serums I heard the cashier talk into her mic saying \""the girl in the white tank is at my register buying now\"" I felt so disrespected when no one even wanted to help me and thought I was stealing because I only had my debit card in my hand?? All those girls were very stuck up & I'm definitely not going there again."
0,"Okay, definitely one of the greatest food disappointments I've experienced ever. For years I have heard of this infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate that I so deeply regretted opting out of during my visit to NY a few months back. So even after an enormous buffet lunch and an almost as equally large Thai dinner, I made sure that I could squeeze some of this drink in me. I am so sad to have wasted my stomach space.\n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate is nothing but a glorified Starbucks Frappuccino for triple the price. The cup size is way smaller than I had expected for an $11 drink. Perhaps you pay for the ambience and experience when you sit in the restaurant, but the to-go line is a definite no-go. The whipped cream is also coming out of a generic brand can, so it's also great knowing that you're paying for such fine quality. And the worst part of the night was the unfriendly worker who wouldn't give me a cup of tap water so that I could somehow manage to finish the overly sweetened, overly expensive, overrated cup of chocolate in my hand!"
1,"OK so what did I think of this place. Well first off after reading these reviews I thought, doesn't sound so bad, so what the hell. So tonight my partner and I went there for dinner!\n\nOK this place says its a Seafood Buffet, someone says its like the Rio SeaFood Buffeet  in Vegas, HARDLY! The Rio is in a completely different and A LOT better.\n\nThis place is hugh, and if you do not get there by 6pm forget finding a placeto sit  its packed. The food was just OK, when you walk in you see this very large boat serving center, that is where the Sushi is at, nice selection for a buffet, but then again not the best,\n\nThey have a section that is like a BBQ area where you pick what you want, and the cooks will cook it for you, a nice selection. They have a meat section its OK, the beek is over cooked, as well as the chicken. They have the same selection of the chinese buffet as any other Chinese Buffet in PHX, in fact there are better places.\n\nThere is a lady who brings the food as well as broadcast to the cooks in the back what is needed, the speakers are so loud in the kitchen that it sounded like a train station anouncements in a chinese train station, This same lady \""bumped\"" into my many times while she was bring out the new food, I understand that she is in a rush, but when there are people in front of me who is overwhelemed by the selection of food I have no place to go, \n\nThe atmosphere is nice, very airy but very loud, when you have a large gruop of people trying to talk to each other, it gets very loud. The wait staff need help, they take forever to clean away dirty plate and to get refils of your drinks.\n\nSo, lets talk about price....  Total for 2 adults with drinks (non alcholoic) was $39. WOW, I couldn't beleive that price. Yes, they serve alcholoic drinks, that is a nice part I saw.\n\nOver all, we wont go back to it, for that pice, I would rather eat some place else. \n\nSave youself from this pace and go some place else."
1,"The food took forever to arrive.\n\nThe steak/lobster tail combo was OK. I liked the steak more than than the lobster tail.\n\nThe chinese chicken salad is tasty, but the wontons get soggy fast.\n\nThe ahi tuna salad is good, but perhaps not really worth it.\n\nOverall, nothing is amazing. I don't really like the atmosphere, because it reminds me of a cleaner Denny's or comparable diner. The food is not really worth it and there are just better options on The Strip. You must get the 50% off meal ticket in order for this place to not be severely overpriced."
0,"Nice facility, no wait.\n\nBut, after calling to find availability of the 50 cal Golden Eagle - and assured it was there and I could shoot it - I drove out there to shoot the promised firearm.\n\nThey could NOT deliver - but they were trying to up-sell to a package deal that included a T-Shirt.  Even after I called - they claimed they had no ammo for the 44 cal version and \""it would be the same\"".  No - it's not !\n\nI walked out - I am not going to pay for the downsized version of the reason I came."
0,"Disgusting food, got food poisoning on my birthday from eating the arizona burrito here yesterday."
3,"J'aime beaucoup ce petit resto du Mile-End d\u00e9j\u00e0 pour sa nourriture qui est tr\u00e8s bonne et vraiment tr\u00e8s fine. Il parait que c'est de la bouffe Fran\u00e7aise m\u00eame si j'ai jamais go\u00fbt\u00e9 de c\u00f4tes lev\u00e9es de bison en France, mais passons sur les d\u00e9tails... L'important c'est que c'est bon! Jusqu'ici je n'ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7ue par le service m\u00eame si j'ai vu dans d'autres commentaires que \u00e7a pouvait \u00eatre in\u00e9gal. A vous de vous faire votre opinion sur le sujet je suppose, mais bon en tout cas, moi j'ai toujours trouv\u00e9 que \u00e7a allait. Ah et puis notez bien que c'est un Apportez votre vin."
4,"I can't believe this is the first time I've tried this deli. I've lived in NYC for 12 years and this place reminds me so much of my favorite delis in NYC with how amazing their sandwiches are. Huge portions, divine bread, fresh toppings, delicious sauces (and their soups are terrific as well).  Can't say enough great things about this place!"
4,"Parking is a little odd if you're just running in. I \""borrowed\"" one of Joe's BBQ's 15 minute pick-up spots and ran up the street to Bergie's. I didn't see till after that there was a parking lot and more street parking behind it! \nThis is a really cute shop made out of an old house. It has a huge outdoor seating area in the \""front yard\"" and is easily handicap accessible. The whole family was in today and my seasonal iced salted caramel coffee was made by the owner. It had the perfect amount of creme and caramel flavouring and was totally worth the $1.75 I paid for a large (Usually only $3.50 but it was half off when you checked into Yelp for the first time!). Also be sure to grab one of their little scones for just over a dollar - cranberry nut, chocolate chip and bacon cheese were today's offerings. The choco chip one had a generous amount of chocolate and was very soft and not overly sweet. Perfect!\nI wish this place was closer! I'd definitely recommend it if you're in the area."
1,"The service is so very slow.  It took far too long just to get our drink orders in.  Then another millenium went by waiting for them.  Then the food came out so much later.  Our server was friendly, but it could not make up for the tremendously slow service.  No, it was not that busy either.\n\nThe food is just ok at best.  I ordered an omlette and it was edible, but not much better than that.  Just no flavor.\n\nI knew better, but I let friends make the choice.  Never again."
4,"The staff is absolutely friendly. It's like home!!! The fish is very fresh and they can make anything you want. The selection of sake is pretty big, the price are not bad and you don't have to wait forever to get your food. I highly recommend."
2,Have only come in for drinks and I was impressed. The selection of drinks is massive and I had no idea what to choose. I love the themed drink list such as Star Wars and Back to the Future. Staff is nice and know what they are doing. They also put the football match on for me when I was there. Kind of pricy and hipster but still not to bad. I like this place and look forward to the next time I come to it especially since I will be trying the food.
1,"Rachel's review was right, exceptionally friendly staff, great service, and my glass was never empty.  20% tip was justified and paid.  Where the discrepancy starts is with the chicken.  \n\nI had stopped in at the souvenir store across the way and had asked if the food at The Horny Toad was good, then gotten the \""Yes!, people come for their chicken & ribs\"" so decided to try it.  Asked the friendly food server what she recommended and revealed it was my first time...Chicken was the answer with a full justification as it was pressure cooked like a fryer and came with Cole slaw and fries.  I had been focused on the Reuben but thought that two local recommendations should be enough to convince me, so ordered the half chicken.  \n\nAgain, service was fast, sitting on the patio was relaxing, and had a very pleasant atmosphere.  But when it arrived, the chicken was really greasy...I guess that pressure cookery was an oil bath too.  Nor much flavor and the breast meat was dry.  No hint of garlic, no touch of lemon, no light chili flavors, just bland dry chicken in oil.  Thank goodness they included a moist towlette to wipe the oil off your hands.\n\nThe bill for the half chicken and a soda with 20% tip was $18.66, a bit pricey lunch to say the least.  The Reuben sandwich lunch was half that.\n\nI'm convinced that I made a wrong choice, should have trusted my instincts and gone with the Reuben, so I'll look forward to the next visit."
1,"Thought we would join friends staying at Lake LasVegas for dinner at Sonrisa. Margarita pitcher was over-priced at $40! Chips and salsa were average. Entrees of tacos, enchiladas and burritos were below average. Next time we'll bring friends into Vegas for Mexican food. Very disappointing."
2,"This place is so close, I come here for last minute, however, this is about the movie and not the \""experience\"" when I come here...\n\na.  Location -  5 Star - If you live in this area, it is great. Huge parking spaces, great restaurants like Jun's Korean and Lemongrass Pho Noodles!  Oddly, the Roundtable here closed. Easy access to freeway and all streets!  Never too crowded.\n\nb.  Service - 2 Star - I would say based on the results of the service, I would say that their goal is to have great service, but management does not set a quality standard.  For a weekday matinee, what possible reason is there to have only one line open when about 10 people are waiting in the 100+ weather to buy tickets?  Then, the air/con inside the ticket room is so powerful that it pushes money and tickets around at the little hole they use to interact with the clients?  At the concessions, why are there about at least 6-7 cashier/ordering spots and only 1-2 open? What would cause you to have a line of 12-15 and not open another cashier???\n\nc.  Stuff - 4 Star - OK, like all places all the normal food. I do like the fact that the large popcorn is in a tub and not a bag. Free refils on large popcorn and soda.  That is a pretty good deal.\n\nd.  Theater - 3 Star - If you are lucky to have a movie in one of their large auditoriums, you get a great cinematic experience. Unfortunately if you get one of the small auditoriums, you get a rinky dink theater screen and it is a just average experience.  The facility is old and getting wornout. It is due for some kind of basic upgrade. Why not let you roam through the lobby and order food while someone else is ordering the tickets? Here you have to use your tickets before you get to the food area. Not efficient\n\ne.  Prices - 4 Star - Now I don't remember, but on Tuesdays they have a great deal on movies and their other prices are similar to everywhere.\n\nOverall , 3 Star - this is a tired place and if you want to full experience, I would say that AMC 16 (rave) is the place to go and perhaps Brendan Theaters.  \n\nI like coming here for a quick movie, but otherwise, I like AMC 16."
1,"The pizza was ok. The sauce was pretty sweet. The wait was 30-35 minutes but it was totally fine, we just sat outside and waited. The guy who was our server seemed a bit...off but he was prompt with service. Not sure if I'll go back."
4,"I'm yet to find anything on the menu I don't like, but the Pizza is top notch.  Wings, deserts, and salads are also fantastic.  My Thursday is not complete unless it includes a fresh pie from Hawthornes!"
4,"I've had BBQ all over the Bay Area and in the South but this was the best I've ever had.\n\nWe had ribs, pulled pork, chicken and brisket.  I couldn't believe how moist everything was.  I didn't use the sauce because is was absolutely but needed.  Its a new \""must stop\"" on our Vegas trips."
4,"My husband took me here for my birthday along with two friends.  It was my first Bobby Flay experience and so I was looking forward to it.  I had little expectations just because it's in a hotel and I didn't know how Tex Mex would be in a casual fine dining atmosphere.  \n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere is great.  It's bright and welcoming.  This place is busy so definitely make reservations.  \n\nWe showed up early and we were told that they wouldn't be able to seat us until our reservations (completely fine), so we left and came back about 3 minutes before our reservation.  They were behind a little.  10 minutes pass and the host let us know that she didn't foret about us but tables were turning slow (loved that she acknowledged us) and then after another 5-10 minutes she came up to us and said that the restaurant would be buying us drinks for the wait (okay!) we sat about a half hour after our reservation and they immediately sent us out an appetizer to again apologize.  I was impressed with how they handled it.  I worked as a host for years and was happy to see that these hosts worked the front so well.\n\nAfter we sat down we were greated by our server and started ordering our food.  Everything came out perfectly from the corn bread to the filet mignon.  The rock shrimp tamale was oh so good!  I am not a Rib Eye fan but the flavor of the cut was so good!  I also had the duck pancake.  I would have eaten those all night.  I would stray from the double baked potato and get the corn if they have it on the menu as a side.  It was like eating candy (not sweet, just you don't want to stop eating it!) \n\nThe chef's in the kitchen are trained to perfection.  People it's NOT Bobby Flay cooking your steak and it's not him making your menu!  Give credit where credit is deserved!  A lot of people don't realize it's just his name and face sometimes but his executive chef's and sous chefs do a lot of the grunt work and creativity! The presentations were beautiful as well.\n\nAnd I can't forget the backwaits.  Our water glasses were never empty, our plates were whisked away silently and we were never bumped into when they were clearing other tables (even though the tables are very close together).\n\nThe prices of the food and drinks are expensive but what do you expect?  Other than the quality being top notch you are in Caesars eating at Bobby Flay.  If you don't like a perfectly cooked filet at $44 then go to Denny's.  I think they have a $2.99 special from midnight to 6am.\n\nThis was a great meal. I would tell anyone going to vegas to try this place because you will not be disappointed!  I love seeing other foodies enjoy this place as much as I did!"
4,"I love this place. The menu was thick with a lot of choices. No matter their class  dishes or bakery, everything was yummy."
4,"Amazing lattes. The baristas are chill and friendly, and the whole place feels like a narrow hollowed-out ship with the wood elements and pseudo-nautical theme.\n\nI especially like the small drawings that adorn the register and walls, including one which poses the question, \""Why do cats purr?\"" with an accompanying doodle of a purring cat seen to have bees on the inside. Because obviously."
4,"I have been going to Dr. Hansen since 2006 & I will continue to see him for all my foot and ankle needs (I even drive all the way from Central Phoenix now to see him).  He is simply amazing!  He listens, he talks WITH you about options instead of talking AT you.  He's compassionate & comforts you if you have a little panic attack or a breakdown like yours truly!  I honestly cannot say enough about him."
1,"I've been waiting almost a year before my GF finally agreed to take me to the Heart attack grill; I'm so conflicted; I wanted this to be the best burger in Vegas but it's definitely not; it's actually pretty close to the bottom of that list. On the other hand if you want a dining experience you get your money's worth so that is where I'm conflicted; \n\nFirst the food; everything is super greasy; cooked in lard/fat and there is no such thing as \""diet\"" or \""healthy\"" here; that would normally be music to my ears and as we were sat and handed our menus I could just see myself going crazy ordering one of the huge coronary burgers but I've been losing weight and didn't want that to stop so I stuck with the regular sized burger and I'm so glad I did; \n\nThe burger was a very thin patty cooked way past well done and could have been used as a hockey puck. I like my burgers thick and juicy so this was highly disappointing; the bacon was left on the grill about 5 minutes too long as well and the burnt texture really distracted from the rest of the burger.  My GF complained it was by far the worst burger she had ever eaten and I disagree with that but only because I've eaten some really bad burgers in my time; I do have to say this one is going on that bad list though! the condiments on the table (mayo kept at room temp is scary)\n\nThe Fries were super greasy to the point they were soft. I know it's the theme here but come on guys you have to go with what tastes good over what is the most unhealthy thing we can put on the menu and I was disappointed with both the burger and fries.\n\nThe milk shake or lard shake or the artery clogging concoction they are calling a milk/lard shake tasted the best but that had a lot to do  with the fact I spent the last 4 hours outside on Fremont Street watching a parade and the coolness of texture oozing down my throat, yes oozing as our meal lasted about 40 mins and the shake didn't melt much you can only guess how much lard they used to make the buttermilk shake;  out of everything this was the best but my suggestion is to pick the vanilla over the chocolate one as it was just too rich for a regular persons pallet; \n\nThe other thing we tried was a syringe full of a frozen shot/slushy; it wasn't bad either and I wish we had ordered more than one or that they had more than one flavor available at a time; I really think they would sell more of these things if your customers could each order a flavor and pass it along  to the other people at the table; \n\nOk, so now the experience.  The food is lacking in taste and quality so why is this place so crazy popular?  In a country as overweight and out of shape as the USA is; this place is popular Because if you weigh a certain amount you eat for free! Walking in you are greeted by nurses who force you to put a hospital gown on and walk you over to a table; yes the staff is on the OMG hot side so if you have a nurse fantasy this is a good place for you; and guys word of advice is your girlfriend asks if she could work there don't hesitate, just say yes with much enthusiasm as she is judging your answer and response time;  Oh and if you aren't able to finish your burger the wait staff will beat you with a wooden paddle; after what happened to me at another restaurant I was more than happy to point out that my GF didn't finish and that I would tip extra if there was a bruise; you would be surprised how eager they are to whip you like a dog; my GF got one spank for every bite she left so keep that in mind once ordering (yes, I finished mine and was saved) \n\nThe entire set up is a bizzaro world hospital; there are no healthy products, you get chastised for asking for a diet coke so don't bother trying.  There are great reproductions on the walls of classic pop culture icons and movies all with a burger/hospital twist so feel free to walk around and look/snap photos; you don't want to miss anything;  the entire event was fun and cheesy in a good sense;  if you have some big hearty eaters in your group they might enjoy trying to take down a double/triple coronary burger but all in all you can easily stand on the outside of the restaurant and peek through the shades/door to see everything of importance just take my word for it you will be sadly disappointed with the food as my GF and I were.  \n\nAll in all our meal was expensive (we did buy a t-shirt) and I won't mention other restaurants by name but if you want a burger you can go elsewhere and get a great burger at a huge savings; I would only recommend coming here if you want to do a food challenge and or you have a nurse fetish/like to be whipped;  \n\nI still haven't figured out how I'm going to rate this restaurant; I want to say 1.5 star for the food and maybe a 3.5 for the ambiance/experience.  So I guess if I average that out it's a 2.5 star restaurant? It seems low but I'm sticking with it.  I'd love to have given it higher marks but even sexy nurses couldn't save the low quality of food"
1,"I specifically went to Yelp to find an Italian restaurant while in Vegas.  I am shocked at how many fantastic reviews are on here.  Either most people have never had real italian food OR they had an off night because my husband and I were thoroughly disappointed.\n\nI had the carbona, and despite it being made with pancetta, it really needed salt!  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was just ok.  It was also kind of difficult to find.\n\nSorry guys..."
2,"Sedona is a good place to have in your happy hour rotation. They offer good drink and food deals, and when it's warm, they have a wonderful outside seating area with fire pit. \nI will warn that if you're not in dating mode, beware of the dating meet ups they have there. It's why I prefer to go when it's warm and not have to run into that. ;)"
4,"I throughly enjoyed my meal and experience at Allegro, located inside The Wynn in LV.  I went with a group for an early dinner before a show.  The sangria is some of the best I've ever had- light and fruity.  The pesto and bread basket served before the meal are both delicious- I usually don't eat too much bread before the meal, but I couldn't help myself- sooo good!\n\nI ordered the pasta carbonara- it was rich and creamy.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals too.  My friend's veal chop literally took up an entire plate. I also enjoyed some pistachio and chocolate gelato for dessert- yum!  I definitely recommend."
2,"I tried Shanes after being recommended by a co-worker and I must say i wasnt that impressed. The food is OK, tried botht he chopped chicken and the smoked chicken. The smoked by far was better. The sides are not tasty at all, the fries are even sub-par. The best thing on the menu is ironically the peach cobbler. I know its nice to have something on that side of town, but good food is worth a drive. Its not horrible but just dont go jonesing great BBQ. Service was good."
1,"I used to enjoy their cold sesame noodles and fried wontons years ago but I have ordered them more recently and have not been impressed. Their entrees lack crave-ability and I've left unsatisfied many-a-visit. \n\nBubble smoothies are good if you want something cold and refreshing. Otherwise, standard menu, sub-par food, and sub-par service. Yes, it's affordable but you can get better food at a similar price elsewhere."
1,"As far as teppanyaki restaurants go this one isn't top of my favorites. 2 stars for good service and a nice setting... I'm docking 3 stars for my food being over cooked and not being offered anything to replace it, and our chef not doing any sort of classic teppanyaki cooking tricks (making oil light on fire, flipping shrip at people, bouncing his utensils around.. ect). Decent place to eat, but not a value for what you pay for."
3,"Growing up in Pittsburgh, I heard a lot about The O but never went in due to the bad rep it got from some violent late-nite incidents that happened there. Walked in on a sunny, safe day (& noticing the black-globe security cams), I got a large to-go order of fries & man, the bag weighed a ton. I felt like I won the lotto walking out with that bag & got a lot of knowing 'Mmmm, theee Oooooh' looks from people on the street who saw me cradling that hot oily bag like a big healthy baby in my arms. Could not wait till I got home so I sat on a bench & had my 1st taste & It Lived Up To Its Hype. Crisp warm golden mealy deliciousness with just enough oil & salt to keep you finger-lickin' happy. Fries came w/ 2 small ketchup bins (free) & 1 small cheese bin ($1.84). Was disappointed with the condiments especially the cheese...$1.84 for a small bin of Cheez-Wiz when you've given me all these fries?!?! (I've always wondered how they make a profit giving you so much food, now I know it's made from the cheese.) Does not compute, but I made do with what I had & the fries lasted 2 days & even tasted better cold. I eat a lot of Los (LocalOrganicSustainable) Hipster food & I'll take The Dirty O over those ironic pretentious twats with great stylists-publicists-social media strategists any day of the week. Needless to say, I will be back.\n\nThe O is everything great about Pittsburgh. Don't overthink it, just do it: Go to The O, consume mass quantities, & fall in love with Pittsburgh again for the very first time."
1,"I agree with other yelpers that this place is overhyped. I liked the big portions because it allowed us to share, but the flavor was lacking and over powering at the same time. Our server was great, but our food was not. My brother and I split the roasted chicken hash and man, was the rosemary super strong! I like rosemary, but it tasted almost bitter. The potatoes were nice and crispy and the biscuit was tasty though. The famous chicken and waffles was disappointing. The presentation was awesome and looked promising, but the chicken was tasteless. The waffles were ok. All in all, it was just ok and we waited a long time."
3,My wife and I just love the food and atmosphere of this quaint restaurant. The service is outstanding and the live entertainment is great. It reminds us of the food we have eaten during our vacations to Uzbekistan and Russia. I would definitely recommend Kavsar to anyone.
3,"Before we left our Vegas trip we wanted to go to Fremont Street for a fun last day. Handsome's parent met up with us and we decided to grab lunch here and do some gambling before our flight. We all liked our food. Handsome, my FIL and I got burgers and my MIL got a club I think? Everything was good! It's not gourmet burgers but it was good for what it was!"
1,recently moved to las vegas so i have been trying all of the local hot spots.  obviously has seen/heard of hash house's fame.  decided to give it a go when my parents came to town this past weekend.  \n\nMEH.  Not impressed in the least.  Seems like the type of place that tries so hard to be non-conformist in their technique/service/menu that they end up coming accross as pretentious - which is laughable for a breakfast place.  i attempted to sub mashed potatoes for crispy potatoes and was told that there were no substitutions because it was a chef inspired menu.. HA!  if i am at Joel Robuchon or any place with a Michelin Star than i understand.. but this was silly.\n\nall in all the food wasnt anything special unless you are impressed by large portions on average food ala claim jumper.\n\nIn my three months in Vegas i still havent had a better breakfast than what can be found @ Black Bear.
4,"I have been to Verde a handful of times now. I agree with some of the earlier reviews that the service was not perfect when the restaurant first opened, but I it has gotten consistently better and my last two experiences have been great. Being a huge fan of the food at Verde in general (especially the Guacamole, Tacos de Camote, and Tres Leches), I was super excited when I heard they were introducing a brunch menu on the weekends. \n\nIn general, the food is a unique twist on traditional Mexican food, always surprising me with an unusual and unexpectedly pleasant combination of flavors that I would never have dreamt up on my own. The brunch menu is consistent with this theme, making it tough to narrow down the choices. In the end, I ordered the Camote Hash (sweet potato hash) and Chilaquiles (almost like a breakfast version of nachos). I was not sure I would like the Chilaquiles when I ordered it - (tortilla chips and a sunny side up egg together in one dish?) but again, I was right to trust the chefs at Verde to fuse these ingredients with an amazing poblano crema sauce into a delightful and extremely satisfying meal. \n\nAlso, I highly recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice. Fresh squeezed juice is hard to find in Pittsburgh, and it is definitely worth the price (so much so that I ordered a second glass). I did not try the Brunch Bottles, but they sound perfect for a group brunch, or just a couple planning for a lazy afternoon."
2,"Convenient late night pizza at the Cosmopolitan hotel. Indeed is a \""secret\"" as it is not listed as one of the hotel's restaurants, and is hidden in the back of a sushi restaurant.\n\nVery basic pizza, tastes good if you're drunk with all that grease. Ate it again when I was sober and found myself not wow'd by the pizza. They don't have Hawaiian pizza. =[ Cousins & I ordered a whole pizza in advance, asking for pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers, and basil. They gave us a pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives??? We didn't want to wait any longer to get the right pizza, but come on... but yeah, bottom line, convenient if you're drunk in the middle of the strip and it's late and you want some decent pizza to help sober ya up."
0,We went because my kids were good this week. We bought the refillable large popcorn and when my 11 year old went to refill it they marked it in front of her refilled then refused to fill it. Why are they trying to screw a child. I am very disappointed in this bad business ethics. I will never be back. If they screw children out of things they have paid for think what they will do to you.
2,"With the name change (formerly Enoteca San Marco) came a blow to the quality of this comfortable eatery.\n\nThe menu is the same.  You get to select the number of items you want to try or share from a well chosen list of cheeses, cured meats, salads, fried items and if you like, add pastas or pizzas to your starter.  Fun.\n\nWines by the glass are still 250ml pours making them a great deal.\n\nThe slip in quality is found in the service and quality of the prepared items.\n\nI am a regular and several managers and servers know me so I have never had any problem with service however, another guest sitting at the bar next to me was told that she had to pay $5 if she wanted an extra marinated cherry with her cheese course.  Another asked for additional olive oil for his bread, his server told him that they give you enough for your bread and wanted to be sure that he would not waste the additional oil.\n\nAs for my food the fried cauliflower was heavily coated in uncooked batter and the pasta was extremely salty.  I sent the pasta  back but thanks to a language barrier (the busser did not speak good English), my dish returned with NO salt.\n\nOh well.  They took it off the check and comped my wine so I was satisfied.\n\nThis is still a good place for a quick bite, especially if you want to enjoy the show that is the Venetian."
2,"I ordered the porky and I'm not sure what it was but there's something about the flavor inside the pasty that did not sit well on my tongue. The order itself was pretty hefty and despite my first misgivings I was able to give into my hunger and gobble the whole thing up. \n\nThe BEST thing about the meal was the desert- strawberry pavlova. The meringue shells were exactly as advertised; crisp, airy, and full of homemade goodness. I hate overtly sweet deserts and this definitely was not that. The fresh whipped cream and fruit were a perfect complement to the meringue shells. \n\nIn fact, I would actually think about returning just for the desert."
1,"Decent fish. Online menu is vague. Mac and cheese is awesome but small portions. Biggest complaint is drive thru window...beyond slow, give yourself 30 minutes"
0,"We have come to the restaurant a couple of time and have had delivery and I am sick and tired of every single time something being wrong. Tonight was the breaking point. We decided to order for delivery because we had 4 kids and dint want to drag them to a busy restaurant on a Saturday night. Every single thing was wrong with out order besides the 2 philly sandwiches. I order a #1 with no tomatoes. Well I got tomatoes and no dressing. We did not receive any of our ranch dressing for our 3 orders of chicken strips or our kids drinks. I decided I should call and get my sandwich fixed. Yeah bad idea! The manger (or whoever) decided to tell me that the delivery guy was \""pissing him off\"" (real professional). Then told me it would be another 20 min before I would get my dressing, drinks and new sandwich. Finally the delivery guy shows up, pissed off at me, and delivers me a ICE COLD sandwich. SERIOUSLY??? I will never ever eat at this place again."
4,"I've been to downtown Tempe a lot since moving to Tempe in 1994. I don't know how long Stan's has been on Mill Avenue, but this place is GREAT!! I took the light rail from downtown Phoenix and exited on Mill. I began walking south on Mill Avenue, craving a good submarine sandwich. I think I've passed Stan's many times, never knowing it was there. I walked in and was shocked that other than 3 guys sitting at 1 table, the place was empty. I was promptly greeted and I asked if I could get something to go. She handed me a menu, and I asked her recommendation between the turkey or roast beef. She recommended the turkey, which I ordered. What a sub! It was by far, one of the best submarine sandwiches I have ever tasted. The reason I was shocked that the place was nearly empty was this was the first week of school for ASU. As I said, I don't know how long Stan's has been open, but their quality of food is fantastic, and in the poor economy, I hope they make it. It's a great place, with a great menu and variety of food. They are open for breakfast, too."
0,"Service was good,  BUT THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE,  MADE ME VIOLENTLY ILL.  I had the '' World famous lasagna''  and as one who makes a mean lasagna,  was NOT impressed with its taste,  but fought thru it anyway,  thinking I was just being overly critical.  Salad was poor,  overall rating should be '' Shut down and make a kiddie playground inside ''  If could give it no stars,  I would..."
2,"I really enjoy staying at this hotel chain whenever I can. It has a nice feel to it. This specific location is in a good location for a lazy traveler. I was visiting Charlotte on business and didn't have much time to get out to some of the neighborhoods that I would have liked to so I appreciated being able to have all of the bars/restaurants right in my own back yard at the Epicentre. My only complaint about this hotel is the elevators. They were a little slow to come and go and one of them was even out of commission when I was there for a few hours. This was beyond the hotels control, but it caused travelers in the morning to be reliant on one elevator for the shared complex. All in all, nice rooms, very clean, and great service."
0,It's a beautiful restaurant in a fun location but the food was not good. The margaritas were Ok but overpriced.  I had tacos and they were very small. You get 3 in an order but they do not allow you to mix and match. Why? I would have liked that option and most (if not all?) Mexican restaurants allow that. My husband ordered fajitas and they were also not good.  There was a large grilled onion on top which was weird. Are you supposed to make a fajita with a big piece of onion then have no onion left for the rest?? He didn't think the meat (what little there was) was very good either. Next time we go to the linq we'll try some place else. There are too many great Mexican restaurants in town (Javier's I'm thinking of you) to ever go back.
4,These gentlemen are amazing.   My son loves barber shops and when we moved I was worried I would have a hard time finding a new place.   This place is perfect and my son came home very happy with his haircut.
1,"This place has potential...\n\nWent to check out this place with Pratik W. a few days ago cause it was in the neighborhood. We had living social deal, which is pretty the same thing as the Yelp! deal they have now.\n\nWalking in, the place was totally empty. Considering it was effing hot outside, I thought the place would be packed. I came in and told them that we had a living social deal and the two girls working there explained in long detail all the different stuff they had. Concretes seemed the same as any other custard place. The gellati from what it seemed like was just soft serve with a slurpee like frozen ice underneath. Unfortunately, according to the two working there, the our living social deal could really only get us a standard soft-serve custard (from the machines you pretty much see everywhere) or a gellati. We ended up going with some soft-serve. I was thinking about getting some mix-ins but each one was a dollar and was not under the deal... \n\nWe were served large tubs of the soft serve. I was disappointed in the fact that there was so actual gelato here. The custard was good, a step-above what you get a dairy queen, but it wasn't even close to Luv-It's frozen custard. I would have been happier with some golden swirl.\n\nI couldn't help but laugh at the big cup of what is essentially soft-serve frozen yogurt we had. Realizing that I had  $10 credit, each one of our cups would have been $5 bucks each w/o the deal. Don't get me wrong, the 'custard' tasted good, but it was definitely wasn't 5 bucks good...\n\nThe serving was huge and to be honest, I got tired of eating it. We ended up dumping about a third of our cups and headed out. The whole experience was \""meh\"" I might return and get a concrete, but then again part of me figures that if I am gonna spend $6-7 on ice cream, id rather go to golden swirl or Luv-It."
3,"This gig has been going on for quite awhile now... This place is all about volunteer workers (service & kitchen work) and about giving back to the Montreal community.  They support 4 local charities (La Chainon, Le Refuge des Jeunes, Jeunesse au Soleil et le Santropol Roulant).\n\nOn the food side, I had a risotto dish which was very good and also as a drink, I had a spicy bloody caesar type drink (don't remember the exact name) which was also interesting (I recommend to try it if you like spicy)."
4,The pancake thingee was amazing. Pho hit the spot. Nice. Clean. Delicious. What more can you ask for?
4,You've got to try the watermelon BBQ sauce on something. I had it on the wings and wish there was room for the ribs. Sounds weird at first but the watermelon isn't over powering or too sweet.
0,"Like the other reviewers, a LOT of hidden fees that you are not aware of until AFTER you book. We live in houston and live 5 mins away from hobby airport but to get the *special deal* we had to leave from bush which is an hr away. Of course, once the fees hit it us, we should have just booked with southwest. I've never heard of an airline that *charges* you to pick your seats?!? Wth? Never again"
0,"This is the third Capriottis I've been to, but the first in Las Vegas. An this was by far the slowest service I have ever received!  Don't be stupid enough to ask for them to give you a hot sandwich, it takes 20 minutes!  We ordered and they served four parties (three ordered after us) before our sandwiches came up. Would have been more, but it was slow, and only three groups ordered after us.  Cold food is the only option if you have somewhere to be, or a limited lunch break."
0,"Disappointed!  This place is a half step up from a Subway.  I sure it's ok for those who have not had the experience of a true New York Deli.  The confusion of where to place an order was the first thing I noticed, as well as the next three unlucky customer's.  A deli that does not serve fries; what's up with that? Sorry Jason's Deli, you flunked the test."
0,The place had a smell like an old stale theatre. The food was blah so I had to salt everything. Soup left a metallic taste in my mouth. Prices were not bad. Had the all you can eat soup and salad. Waitress was not very attentive. Ordered a bowl of one soup and she brought me the wrong one
3,"last time i went to vegas to see my buddy play in the VEGAS bowl \nGO WiLDCATS !!! lol\nand my family wanted to eat here for lunch. i said okay.\nthank god we did.\nthis place is soooooooo good !. \ni mean i know theres certain ways to eat sushi idk ..to get the freshness and blah blah ....\nwho cares im mexican !!! i just eat it , stuff it down my throat lol !\neverybodys so freakin proper. JUST EAT ! \ndef. recomend this place !"
2,"Great view.  If you've been to the observation deck at Stratosphere, then you pretty know what type of view to expect.  \n\nThe food was mediocre for the price.  I ordered the 16 oz. rib-eye ($54) with a 1/2 lb lobster tail ($26) and an added foie gras ($10).  \n-Rib-eye: soft but a little too fatty (and I like the fat on my meat)\n-Foie gras: small (what can you expect for $10) and good but nothing special.  A little too much liver tang in the flavor\n-Lobster tail: NO NO NO.  It was just completely wrong -- the flavor and the texture were just off.  One of the driest lobsters I've had.\n\nAs for the service.....well, it took nearly 20 minutes for someone to come around.  Then another 40 minutes for the food to come out.  And another 15 minutes at the end of our meal to get the Snoot face.  \n\nA cool part of the experience to note, however, is that the restaurant rotates very slowly so diners can partake in the \""360\"" view.  The sudden awareness that the room was spinning gave me a split second feeling of drunkenness..until I realized that the room was actually spinning.  \n\nOverall, romantic ambiance.  Next time, I'm just going to hang out at the lounge upstairs after dinner elsewhere.  Same view and ambiance but better service."
0,"I needed to schedule and review session after being referred to an outside specialist.  I was told to fax or bring over the paperwork and the doctor would review the information without me and then schedule an appt. This was completely inconvenient to me and my time much less 2 trips to doctor's office which is 40 miles total.  If they are too busy to review information with me and respect my time, I can find another clinic or doctor that is willing to spend time with me and my child."
3,"Love this place. What can I say and it is not because of the fact that I can walk to it. Now granted the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the fact that it desperately needs a remodel. \n\nThe food is excellent and the service is seriously so good, you almost want to tuck one of your little Asian servers in your pocket and take them home with you and make them an indentured servant of some sort or slave.\n\nBut on a serious note, this is one of those hidden little gems you almost don't want to yelp about due to the fact that you don't want a ton of people to find about it and ruin it."
0,"This has been my worst experience at any boba spots ever. The customer service was horrible. Everyone on staff had no clue what was going on and missed a bunch of orders, including mine. They left me waiting for forty five minutes before proceeding to make my order after I told them many times. And the last thing that completes it is they messed up my order. This location sucks and the service sucks. Opt for another boba place when you're in Vegas."
4,I been here few time and I love the Himachi Kama is good. You Gotta try the Osaka roll it's awesome and the staff little funny :)
2,"For the price, the pizzas is pretty good. A WHOLE lot better than Dominos, which costs about the same. Their wings are good too. Unfortunately they raised prices recently. Wings are a bit on the high side but the pizza is still competitively priced. Still pretty good pizza."
4,"we took a weekend off, we live in tucson, got a nice hotel in phoenix and tried a couple of new to us restaurants.\n\nthis place is both eye-awesome and taste-amazing.\nwe watched them make the bread, walked around looking at the walls and listened to conversations in a half dozen languages...wow.\n\nobviously a place for Iranians to eat.\ngenuine tastes, lots of food, mint on the table, a bit overwhelming.\nwaitress answered our questions with a hint of a smile, we tasted everything carefully, sniffed the air and loved everything.\nthanks."
4,"We went for dinner with no reservation, we were starving, the hostes managed to acomodate us in the community table right away. Minutes later we had a table. The decor is faboulos, the people are dressed up. The waiter was a darlying, service was fast, food temperature perfect. The flavour of the food amazing. Two thumbs up...We went back the next night. Cant undersand how anybody could not like this place..."
4,We loved it. Large portions and good home cookin food.
3,"I probably would have given it a 3 star rating (very trendy and spendy not a \""bistro\"" see review by TT) but my date loved it so I had better give it 4 stars. I had the lamb shank which was more than slightly over done. The scallops were however excellent. The mussel appetizers were good but pretty hard to blow that. Service was solid but a little slow. I had the house french bordeaux wine which was also good. They also have a nice Sancerre by the glass. The bar area looked \""interesting\"" and was moderately crowded with elderly Manthers all hooked up with women half there age. Oh that famous Scottsdale bar scene!  I may return for a cocktail or three :-)......"
1,"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I don't know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying \""x large pizza and large salad only 23$\"". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. \n\nTo the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively. \n\nAnd your salads are severely overpriced \n\nWon't go back unless I'm desperate."
4,"This store is kick ass. Picked up a pair of Jordan Spi'zikes today with no mark up they had plenty to choose from. I loved the sale they recently had on all the retro AJ1's too... picked up the red do the right thing pack for 30% off, came out to like $75 total.... for a pair of AJ1's! I dropped almost twice that on some pairs. \n\nThey have all the awesome shoes and can make special orders since they are a Nike top dealer. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeble. Weird that Adrian Wilson owns the place."
1,"That's great that they are a locally owned business and they have cheap drinks and food at Happy Hour.  But it is an ugly, boring location with an ugly, boring menu.  My brother-in-law loves this place but I just don't get it."
1,"We called because Familia Pizzeria was already closed and my husband and I had some serious late night pizza cravings. We ordered a large with pepperoni and mushroom and I wish I read that they used canned mushrooms so I could have chosen a different topping. The pizza was alright, though I found the crust to be too thick for my liking, and the canned mushrooms looked like escargot, in mushroom form. They were having a special for a large 2 topping for $10. I wouldn't have paid one penny more. I may possibly make a return visit given that they are the last people open once again, but will definitely skip the mushrooms."
3,"Tiny restaurant, big potential.\n\nThe boyfriend and I decided to use my Groupon for lunch on Saturday and we couldn't have made a better choice. Centurion has a laid back atmosphere perfect for sitting outside and having a leisurely lunch. When we got there, there was only one other table sat so luckily we were able to grab a spot in the shade. They have a nice big canopy over their patio to help cut down on the direct sun. The inside looked cute (tiny, but cute) but outside was the place to be.\n\nWe started off with the baked brie. It comes wrapped in a pastry shell with jam inside and grapes on the side. Warm, gooey brie with jam? How could you go wrong? I ordered the shrimp and crab sandwich and boyfriend went for the tenderloin sandwich. Both came with salad on the side.\n\nMy sandwich was really good. The bread was fresh and it was loaded with shrimp and crab. I ordered it without dijon and it did feel like it could have used something else on it. But overall I liked it. Boyfriend felt the same way about his sandwich - good but needed a little something to make it great.\n\nThe side salad was very good. it was spinach with blackberries and a blackberry dressing. Simple but good. But then again I'm a big fan of spinach, too.\n\ni could see this place becoming quite the hot spot. Like I said, big potential. I think if they fine tuned a few things it could be really, really good. I recommend checking it out now before you have to wait for hours to get a table."
0,"If I can give this place negative stars I would. I selected this location as my primary care provider because it was close to home. I have visited this Dr office 3 times and 2 of my 3 visits resulted in extremely long waits and no consideration for other patients time what so ever. Let me just say that my visit today was just to get some blood results in which I already knew what the results were so I only anticipated my visit to take 5 mins. I also want to say the Dr I was assigned to was Dr. DeBellis. On my first visit I felt that the lady who checked me in treated me as if I was impeding on her time. But after completing the necessary paperwork and a couple returns to her desk she warmed up to me. The 2nd visit I waited 45 minutes to be seen by the Dr and by this time the front counter clerk noticed I had been waiting extremely long. My 3rd and last visit (today 08/27) my appt was scheduled for 11:15. I arrived 10 minutes early for my appt and upon checking in the front counter lady advised me that the Dr was running 20 min behind and said that I shouldnt be waiting as long as last time. I figured ok I can handle that. Well I had kept myself occupied on my phone for an hour and noticing there was me and 2 other people in the lobby before realizing I had waited that long. So I asked another office asst what the delay was and that I had been waiting for nearly an hour. All she could tell me was I was next. 15 mins later (now waiting an hour 15 mins) I approached the counter again demanding an explanation why the Dr was taking so long. All she could tell me was that the Dr had 3 other patients waiting and that I was next. At this point I was losing my patience and asked if there was a nurse, nurse practitioner, or office manager I could speak to or if another Dr could give me my results. Needless to say no one was available. It was then suggested to me that I reschedule my appt and then I was told my appt was scheduled at a bad time. (Wtf?!? And mind you I waited 5 weeks for my appt). I finally am told that the dr would see me in his office. So waiting yet again by this point it is now going on an hour and a half the dr finally comes in all upset with me and said that he has emergencies! I told him if these people have emergencies than they should have gone to an emergency room and that I had been waiting for an hour and a half for an appt I had sheduled at 11:15 in which  I arrived early for. Then he asked me if I had lab results and I told him thats what I was there for. Then he yelled back at me that he didnt deserve this abuse! He read my results off a printed report and I told him I wanted to talk to the office manager so that they can better manage his time. I asked the dr why another dr couldnt have just read my results. So long story short I apologized if I seemed to be abusive toward him but it was unacceptable that I have to wait an hour and a half for a five minute visit.  His answer was something along the lines that he didnt make the rules. (wth? Someone couldnt read a piece of paper to me?) lastly I waited another 5 mins and talked to the lady who checked me in and the last thing she told me was that Dr. DeBellis always runs late and that I could change drs who runs pretty on time. Sorry this a long rating but seriously? As soon as I walked out I called my insurance and changed my primary car provider to a different office altogether. \n\nFirst of all I dont care what kind of insurance I have drs get their payment either way and I could have saved my silly $5 copay for them to either call me with the results or pay the f'n 49cents postage to mail me my results! Second of all Dr. DeBellis ALWAYS runs late?!? I dont care how much of an amazing dr you are, learn some time management!!! Doctors should appreciate that there are people like me who have taken the time and effort to educate myself and lead an active healthy lifestyle to keep myself healthy so they can attend to the more serious conditions that others suffer! Plus the insurance companies should be paying me since I am the minority who keeps the premiums low and allow them to cover those with more catastrophic illnesses!!"
2,"I don't do my big shopping here, but there are certain items I totally come to AJ's for.  Like Rothchild's condiments.  Can't live without my Balsamic-Onion Jam---totally makes a roast beef and brie panini.  And they have a lot of other specialty items.  I always end up spending more money on those gourmet items once I am in the store.  I am a condiment slut---just check out my fridge and pantry!\n\nFor grilling hamburgers, DH always sends me to pick up AJ's ground sirloin.  He says that is totally the best flavor hamburger around.  \n\nI don't have a lot of interaction with the folks there---I just get my stuff and go, but they seem pleasant and ready to help.\n\nI appreciate they offer a fair amount of my favorite goodies.  That is the hardest part about moving to a new place---leaving behind your \""special\"" brands.  But then you walk out of the store and look at the mountains and it's like: \""duh\"".  That makes up for no Frisch's Special Sauce or Dei Fratelli Tomato products."
0,"Burnt my hair!!\n\nI don't know how to keep this review short, but I will try. I made an appointment for a haircut (a trim) and to tone my hair. \n\nThe stylist \""Sandra\"" was very nice and tried her best, but her best is less than mediocre. She was supposed to just trim my hair but instead she chopped it. It was the worst haircut ever. The back is uneven. \n\nAs far as the toning, She was told to tone my hair. NOT BURN IT. She decided that 35/40 developer and bleach (for an hour) was the better alternative. I've been bleaching my hair for a while, I didn't think it would be THAT bad. \n\nShe should have checked on my hair every few minutes to make sure it would not burn. But instead, she took n another client simultaneously, semi-ignored me, and let my hair burn. \n\nI should have  known better than to come here. I left semi annoyed but the following days were devastating. My hair didn't stop falling out. \n\nI can go on but I said enough. Just don't go there."
3,"Delicious tapas. Portions a bit small so go with 3/person (they suggest 2-3/person). Loved everything we got: bacon wrapped figs, goat cheese and tomato cake, cheese platter, mushroom risotto, scallops, and chicken croquetas. Red sangria was perfect... Not excessively sweet but flavorful and fruity."
0,"I do love burgers, but not the ones here. I gave this place 1 star, because you cant't give 0 on Yelp. For $17, my friend and I shared a \""I love bacon\"" burger - not a lot of bacon, burger was dry (we ordered medium cooked), didn't taste the bacon mayo (if there was any on the burger), and the burger was small (Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheeseburger is bigger and Wendy's single Baconater beats this burger hands down). And as the other reviewers have mentioned, an In-n-Out burger for $2 tops this burger. We also ordered the restaurant's housemade chips, as suggested by the waitress. They tasted as though they had been sitting out for awhile. Since this is Vegas, I'll \""bet\"" this place doesn't last longer than 2 years, if that long. With all the food choices available, I would never go back here again. I would gladly pay $17 for a burger at Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay - that place never disappoints and the burgers are juicy, flavorful and cooked to order. I'm surprised that the Venetian/Palazzo would have a place like I Love Burgers that doesn't meet the culinary standards of their other casual dining establishments. I don't like writing negative reviews, but if I can save another person from wasting $17 on a burger here, the review would have done itself justice. And yes, I should have read the other reviews on this place before eating here."
0,"This place is terrible.  The people who work there are rude and unattentive.  I am a marathon runner and have started using a brand of fuel that is sold at very few places, and they have the best selection.\n\nAgainst every fiber of my being, I had to give this place some additional business, despite my terrible experiences purchasing accessories prior.  MY MISTAKE.  \n\nI rolled up to the shop after a long strenuous hill run and was in desperate need for some recovery fuel (within that critical 60 minutes).  Low and behold I had just missed them since they closed at 6pm.  But one of the guys was there running a spin class outside and let me in - pretty nice, I thought!\n\nI popped in, grabbed what I needed and headed up to the counter.  I apologized to the guy working in there, saying I recognized they were closed and I really appreciated it.  Not only do I get zero response, but I get zero acknowledgment.  No eye contact, no \""hi, I'll be right with you,\"" not even a \""lady wait your turn,\"" nothing.  Like I didn't exist.\n\nSo, I patiently stood at the counter with my 3 packets while the employee poked around the repair area, avoiding me, waiting for the customers ahead of me to shop around.  I could see there was zero chance he was going to talk to me, much less ring me up, while he waited for them to look at shirts, shoes, saddles, you name it.\n\nAfter 20 minutes (no joke, 20 minutes) of standing around completely unacknowledged, I threw the packets on the counter and walked out.  The spin class guy outside watched me leave, empty handed.  Who knows if he did the math on the lost sale, because not only will I never purchase fuel from them again, I will go elsewhere when I decide to buy a road bike.\n\nI now order all of my fuel online.  So much for patronizing a local business."
3,"They open until 5am in the morning. Perfect for the hungry college student. The family who owns this place is hilarious. The person who takes your orders at the window is the husband who encourages you not to get the \""worthless white rice\"" that us Asians love and get the brown rice instead. The wife is equally hilarious. The first time I went we were the only ones in the restaurant except for two other people. One of the guys was getting quite loud and rowdy so the wife threatened to kick him out with a baseball bat.\n\nAs for the food, it's good and fresh. The fried chicken I ordered tasted especially good with the red chili flakes they had at the table. Large portions and filling. Great late-night/super early in the morning meal."
2,"A bunch of my friends and I had a college reunion in Vegas and on the last night there we decided to stop by this place for dinner. The burgers were really good, but the service was SLOWWW!! Not to mention, when one of the food runners (I'm assuming that's what he was) came out with a side of ranch for my friend, and she said thank you, he replied, \""My pleasure...(pause)...Not really, they pay me to say that.\"" Um... really?\n\nMinus the snarky dude, we enjoyed the food and had a good time."
1,"Not very hard to find, clean and stocked as all GNC stores are, but the sales girl seemed to have limited knowledge about the products. I feel that a store in this field should have employees who actually know something about the products that they are selling to the public. I am aware that in this day and age, that is something that is not commonplace, but still reduces my rating to only 2 stars!"
4,Dr. Ed and his wife are the greatest. I highly recomend them. Dr. Ed is extremely knowledgable and truly cares about the well being of his patients. If you are in need of chiropractic care you would be doing yourself a huge disservice by not coming here. That is a PROMISE!!!!
1,"The good - the apperience\n\nThe bad - the beds, the heat inside the casino and the Tequila and Taco shop (if you like mexican food - do not dine here) - just wait till you go back home!\n\nThe ugly - the dancing girls placed around the casino to be loud and distracting\n\nOverall - rooms were clean (enough). outdated and hard beds.  Pyramid Cafe had some good service - I won't stay here again, but not for poor service.  I like the  new and shiny - this is too old and drab for me"
4,"I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?\n\nThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.\n\nAND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early."
1,"Okay, so I'm a bit spoiled. Normally in Vegas I stay at nice hotels. But, since my convention was at the Riviera I figured I'd just stay there rather than have to cab back and forth from another hotel. My room was in the original tower (built in the 50's) and felt like a Motel 6 with new tile. The rooms have been renovated, but even your grandma looks old after her most recent facelift. \n\nAlthough its on the strip, it's pretty out of the way (but within walking distance of Encore or the convention center) and its surrounded by empty ghost properties that fell victim to the recession (Fountain Blue and Echelon).\n\nHow strange is this: although the building is only 6 stories, the elevator numbers are listed 31-36. So if you want to go to the ground floor, you have to press 31 (and there's no instructions, I sat in the elevator for 5 minutes until another hotel guest got in and instructed me on the Riviera elevator nuances)\n\nBottom line: it's a cheap hotel, but I wouldn't call it a bargain.\n\nPros: relatively cheap, great English pub, decent beds, flat screen tv (but it's small), mini-fridge in room for personal use, lots of history, free in-room wi-fi\n\nCons: Old and worn down, shower head is about 5 feet off the ground, resort fee ($11/night), $3.50 per night if you want to use the in-room safe, long wait to check in"
4,"Talk about Tacos!!! \nWelcome to the mother land, nothing like a Mexican subway!! Love their tacos, everything is cooked to perfection; one of my favorite taco places in Vegas!! \nIt's a little crowded but hey more people too mingle with, enjoy."
2,"I typically eat Pho when I'm wanting to eat \""light\"". I get the grilled chicken small bowl and I like to think it's sort of healthy. \n\nThe last time I dined here with my coworker we both felt awful all day. I couldn't eat dinner, I had trouble concentrating at work, nauseous, etc, etc. The verdict? Insane amounts of MSG. In fairness I am relatively sensitive to MSG but this is the worst MSG reaction I've ever had. \n\nThe quest for pho with less MSG continues!"
0,"To my delight, I received a butterfly bouquet from my son this past Friday for Mother's Day.  I added water to the container immediately.  It contained yellow daisies and 3 of my favorite Sterling Silver Roses.  On Saturday, three of the daisies were completely dead and one of the roses started to droop.  By Sunday, one rose was completely dead, two other roses started to droop along with other daisies.  I called Tiger Lily and they  told me they would replace it between 9am and 1pm on Monday and pick up the other bouquet.  At 1:15pm on Monday, I called Tiger Lily again.  The man said there was no time specified for re-delivery.  He told me if I waited until Tuesday, I would receive a bigger and better bouquet between 1 and 5. He said the flowers are cut way ahead of time for busy seasons so when I received the arrangement, they were already old, and a new shipment of fresh flowers would be delivered to them on Tuesday.   At approx. 3:30 Tuesday, they redelivered the bouquet, which was the same as before, but had no sterling silver roses; they were replaced with purple orchids.   I was not home at the time or I would have sent everything back to them and told my son to dispute the charge on his credit card.   My son said for what he paid for this arrangement, $50+ which he thought were going to be larger, he would NEVER EVER order from them again.  VERY Disappointing.  This company deserves NO stars!!!!!!  Overpriced to say the least."
3,"Gaby Et Jules is exactly what one should expect of a good French bakery!  The atmosphere is spot on.  Clean, small, lovely, and you can see the full kitchen and chefs baking away behind glass.  It's just wonderful. Onto the desserts...\n\nDIVINE!  I purchased an assortment of delicacies for my holiday party, from macarons to tiny tarts and pufed pastries.  Everything was delish and decorated beautifully.  \n\nMy only critique is the price.  Yes, the items are specialty, but $3+ per macaron (unless you buy in bulk, b/c the price does go down) is a bit steep. $7 avg. per pastry?  I mean, this is still Pittsburgh.  These prices rival NYC.  Macarons are such a fad dessert right now that people forget that they aren't incredibly difficult to make, and the ingredients are pretty inexpensive.  That being said, they were very good... just overpriced in my opinion.\n\nOverall, c'est magnifique! (I couldn't resist.)"
2,"This location is small, warm inside, and very dim lighting. Not the best IHOP I've ever experienced. The neighborhood is questionable...right next to the projects. \n\nThe food was good, just like any other IHOP. Our waitress was great, wish I would have caught her name so I could give her a shout out.\n\n\""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" but overall it was \""A-OK\""! :)"
3,"Amazing happy hour!!  We stopped here on vacation on advice from someone we met at a ballgame.  Very glad we went.  The HH deals they have are pretty awesome.  Our total bill was $30 and we had 3 sushi rolls, cucumber salad and 2 beers.  Not bad at all.  The sushi was pretty yummy."
3,Always great food and great service. The Prickly Pear sandwich is a classic. I recommend the chicken wings and pizza. The restaurant has a cozy feel and it's great to patronize a locally owned establishment.
4,"What's not to love? Its a great hidden NY style pizza spot. Pizza is fresh, fast and price isn't bad considering its on the strip. The guys who work there are always friendly. Love the variety of things they have for you to shake on the pizza since you get it. Highly recommend!"
4,"Pappas Park Lanes is one of those places we all grew up with and now is an icon - never to be repeated again.  It's not just an old bowling alley, it's an institution.  We all grew up with places like this as a kid and when we return as adults, it feel comfortable...like returning home briefly until your parents start meddling in your life and tell you to get a real job or join the merchant marines.  \n\nCompared to many other places in town, the prices really aren't that bad.  There's ample parking, room for groups, and the inside is 40+ years old.  Strike City is definitely more modern but you must pass a credit check in order to play a frame or two.  No thanks!\n\nA surprise at Pappas Park Lanes is that the food is pretty good...no, it's really good.  People from work would tell me that some would go there just for the food - which I didn't believe until this week when I enjoyed the barbecue pork sandwich.  I couldn't find any sauce so with just coleslaw, I tackled the large sandwich.  It isn't The Rock Store but I would rank it among the better in that part of town.  \n\nThe burgers are made fresh too...like with hand-formed ground beef instead of a frozen puck that so many restaurants serve.  \n\nWe recently spent an afternoon bowling and really enjoyed the staff, food, and the fun."
4,"Great, easy trail for the whole family.  The trail head isn't too far from the greater Phoenix area on the east side.  The directions to the trail head involve a lot of twists and turns through Gold Canyon, AZ, but it wasn't hard to follow.  (Tip 1. At the time of writing this, the Google Maps location was a little off, but it wasn't hard to find on the Google map.)   The elevation doesn't change much on the walk to the hieroglyphics.  And it is hard to get lost as you can see for miles in any direction for most of the trail.  (Tip 2. Near the end, the trail peters off, but keep going and you'll find one or two pools of water depending on the season.)  There will be more petroglyphs than you an shake a stick at.  It is a really nice ending to a pleasant hike.\n\nHowever. . .\n\n(Tip 3. If you are more adventurous, you can scale one of the nearby ridges.)  There are no trails beyond the pools, so you will need to rely on your own route finding skills.  I believe that the guide book wanted us to proceed in the direction the trail left off down the valley and then bend up the right along a ridge line.  We took the left ridge, and walked straight up.  The views from the top are spectacular.  This is a good option if you are looking for something more than a family hike.  Again, you are unlikely to get lost as visibility is high in most directions."
1,"Been coming here for awhile and feel like the costumer service is on the decline. Pulled up asking where to park that didn't require valet, was told \""not here\"" so had to park across the street and cross Indian school with no crosswalk. Once we were in the patio we were told a 40 minute wait for a table for two. So we took a seat at the bar and immediately afterwards 3 tables opened up in which no one was seated at until after our food arrived (30 minutes later). Food was good but the management needs to work on how the business is being run. Doubt I will be back for a long time."
0,"Never again!  Horrible work, went in for a quick manicure ($15) on Sunday, by Monday it was chipping.  Tech only spent like 5 mins on my nails before painting. Waste of money!\n\nPs. Only cash for tips"
2,"Had been trying to go to this place since seeing it on DDD, but every time I was in vegas I was unable to make it.  Its in a really weird spot.  Its in a strip mall between a cigarette store and a jewelery repair shop.  The windows are covered up.  Seriously, it looked like it was either closed or a store front for organized crime.  But when I walked in the door the difference is night and day, literally it's kinda dark.\nAnyway I had the sausage combo.  I forgot what it was called. Possibly something with a lot of B's and K's.  Brokkfrughen or Krubbbrrnfffyka maybe; I don;t know.  But it was good.  It came with some navy beans and a sauce that I really enjoyed.  i believe it was made from pimentos or something.  Never the less it was delicious.\nThe service was kinda slow,  One lady seemed to be the bartender hostess and waitress.  I believe she was Russian.  Nyet,  Sorry thats the only Russian I know.  Wait.....Stolnichaya.  I know that too.\nAnyway had the food, prices were reasonable and I would go back.  oh and try the Sangria I hear its a good cure for a hangover."
0,"The pizza was flat, almost no sauce, doe was hard and just not good. Even the kids (that like any pizza), did not like it and only took a few bites.  Maybe it's just this location, since I have ordered in Miami with satisfaction. I will just stick to Pizza Hut when in town and recommend the same."
3,"If you like cheeseburgers do yourself a favor and come in and try the cheesy cheeseburger they have there, it's great. Not going to lie, this would be a delicious way to cure a hangover as well"
3,"Itty Bitty MadHouse Coffee Review\n\n- On a cold Sunday night, the boypren and I dropped by for something hot to warm us up.\n- 12 ounce red velvet mocha with almond milk for me.  Americano coffee for him.\n- The drinks hit the spot.\n- Funky little coffee house at Desert Inn and Durango in the Von's shopping plaza.\n- They have hookahs here!\n- Keith Haring theme is kinda retro and very cool.\n- I'll be back to try the \""Michael Jackson\"" drink:  white chocolate and regular chocolate coffee drink.\n- I'm a fan of the red velvet mocha."
4,"As I vowed I would do, I returned to Panevino, this time with my visiting mother and my wife. We had requested a booth if available, but one was not when we arrived. So, we agreed to be seated at a table instead. We were ushered to a table with soaring panes of glass that overlooked the McCarran International Airport runways, which allowed us to see airplanes take off and land when we could avoid the sun that was facing us. But we did not stay there long. A few minutes later, a server told us that a booth had just opened up, and asked if we wanted to move there. Primarily because of the strong sunlight shining at us, we accepted the offer to move. The restaurant personnel took care of all details involved in the move, such as transferring our beverages to the new table. Then we settled into a nice, plush leather booth. The upscale ambiance was further enhanced by sounds of an Italian tenor and other background music being piped into the dining area. \n\nWe began with Polpettine Di Granchio, crispy Maryland style crab cakes that were drizzled with a smooth and sweet Honey-Mustard Dressing. The dish looked darker than most crab cakes I have eaten elsewhere but their taste was good. \n\nI tend to prefer Stracciatella (Italian Wedding Soup) or Pasta Fagioli over Minestrone Soup. But on this occasion I opted for the Minestrone con Pesto Di Basilico. And, it was a great choice! The excellent hot broth with just a touch of Basil Pesto virtually burst with the flavors of several vegetables: carrots, celery, and melted tomatoes. No beans were included in the soup, and the slightly hard veggies melted on contact with the roof of my mouth. I liked this as much as I had the Papa Di Pomodoro on my initial dining foray here. \n\nNext I had Veal Parmigiana, four large thinly pounded and lightly breaded scallops of veal covered by a mild but robust and tasty tomato sauce ladled over melted Mozzarella Cheese and Parmesan Cheese.  Although this dish did not appear on the dinner menu, it was nevertheless graciously prepared upon request. As another accommodation, the quite ample and tasty entree was served with mouthwatering Fettuccine Alfredo. I also sampled buttery roasted potatoes which were not cooked all the way through. But the tender and lean veal was delicious and very filling. \n\nI ended this fine repast with a sensational Italian Cream Millefoglie con Crema Pasticcerae e Fragole, which had a fresh strawberry flavor, and consisted of puff pastry that was layered with pastry cream and fresh strawberries. The pastry chef also displayed artistry on the plate supporting this delicious dessert. \n\nService was very attentive but unobtrusive throughout our stay, just as it had been on my previous visit. And, the immediate surroundings are gorgeous. So, Panevino has now become my favorite Italian restaurant of choice--not just in Las Vegas, but anywhere!"
0,"Really, one of the worst Mexican Food Restaurants in the area, and while the decor is nice and this would be a good place to take the kids, the food is just terrible and the place is expensive.  Tough to find good Mexican food in Phoenix, but this just isn't it."
2,"On a Sunday, we ordered 1 dozen donuts and a  sm iced mocha for 16\n\n- Expensive donuts. 1/2 dozen is $6! ouch. More than Krispy Kremes\n- Soft and chewy. Nowhere near the texture of a Albertsons. haha\n- No more munchkins! Glazed goes fast! Come early\n- Sm is the size of a grande at starbucks!?\n- Pre-made fail yet still good. oxymoron?!\n- Too much hype for something not in CA"
3,"Woooooooooo Earl of Sandwich!\n\nLove this little spot in Planet Hollywood's Miracle Shops. I've had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich as well as the Hawaiian BBQ. I wouldn't say these are the best sandwiches I've ever had (some of my friends are OBSESSED) but I definitely can't find anything to complain about. Such a tasty cheap lunch in Vegas when you're burnt on buffets and alcohol, and also a great fourth meal if your night calls for it ;)"
0,"TOTALLY GONE DOWNHILL BIG TIME! Couldn't wait to get to Vegas so I could go to Ghirardelli. The only other one I know of is in San Fran. I don't know what the hell was going on and I should have said something to the employees but I didn't. My hot fudge sundae came in a plastic to go cup, not a pretty glass dish (I did not ask for it to go) and my hot fudge was not hot AT ALL. I felt like I was getting a pre-made sundae that  had been sitting in a fridge for a few hours. The fudge was ice cold and had already hardened up. I am pretty pissed off about it. I didn't eat the whole thing. The last time I went to Ghirardelli  in Vegas it was still at the Hawaiian Marketplace. It was excellent then. I don't know if this is the way it is now or if it was just a jerk off employee. BAD! BAD! BAD! Just so you know it was Sunday 06/22/14 around noon. So whoever was on staff that day needs to find a new job. Had to pay a cabby just to get there."
4,"St. Francis is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix for the following reasons:\n\n- It is trendy and chic with a cool indoor/outdoor bar and an upper mezzanine seating level\n- It is neither in a strip mall nor is it part of a fancy, sprawling resort - very rare for Phoenix\n- There are both moderately priced ($11-12) and more expensive ($20-25) entrees, so you can please everyone in your party\n- Cocktails are inventive and tasty (try the almond margarita)\n- I've tasted at least half of the menu, and all of the items have been good to great (personal favorites include the salmon and the meatballs)\n\nWord to the wise: if you don't want to wait, avoid prime dinner hour on Fridays and Saturdays and brunch on Sunday - it can get pretty crowded!"
0,"This is the first Yelp review under four stars I have ever given a business.  I have a common skin condition called tinea versicolor that I needed treatment for.  I looked online for local dermatolagists and noticed that Ahwatukee Skin and Laser received excellent reviews, so I scheduled an appointment at their office.  The doctor was very nice, looked at my condition, confirmed the diagnosis, and prescribed me medication for it.  During my visit, she asked if she could take a quick look at my back for any unusual freckles.  She noticed one that seemed abnormal, so she asked me if she could take a quick sample of it, so I said \""sure\"".  When I my visit was over, I aksed if I needed to do anything else other than pay my co-pay, and was told I was all set.  Several months later, I received a bill for a $100.00 - the office billed my insurance company for a \""minor surgery\"" when the doctor took a sample of my freckle, and now I had to pay out of pocket for it.  I asked why I wasn't informed of this during my visit - their front office personnel told me this was \""standard practice\"".  I don't know about you, but I like to know the cost of a product or service before I agree to purchase it.  Now, I just received a bill for \""NO SHOW\"" to an appointment that I never scheduled.  Apparently, the office personnel scheduled my appointment a full year in advance without notifying me and notified me by voicemail two days prior to my appointment.  It took the office staff over three months to respond to my initial inquiry and now they are wanting to charge me all late fees on my bill.  Not a happy customer."
2,"Not much to be said that isn't already known about a Ross store. However, if you are like me you mostly come to Ross for linens, shoes, or purses. This store usually has a better selection and greater quantities of these items. I have found that you really need to get here early or something for linens, everyone and their dog snatches up the best pillows, comforters, sheets etc. Purses and shoes are a different situation, there is usually a huge variety that I have only seen in one other Ross, and that was the Ross located on the strip in Las Vegas. Those showgirls aren't going to dress themselves. Expect crying babies, strollers, security guards aplenty, and long lines. But it's Ross at Arizona Mills, what won't you do for a bargain?"
0,"Never again am i going to think about booking with them. RUDEST FLIGHT ATTENDANCE i have ever had to deal with. They wouldnt bother helping our group when we asked for drinks or food, nothing. Took for ever to get our attention pressed the call button came 10 minutes later. Never shut all the doors for the carry on luggage, i dont know how they got that job. If i could rate this to a zero i would have."
4,"Yeah, this is as good as it gets unless you are in Europe! We were here for a Yelp Event and was so lucky to be walking by when we saw their unbelievable desserts. We had no intentions of eating, we just finished huge burgers at Holsteins in the Cosmo, but we couldn't resist. I ordered the Cinnamon Bun and my girlfriend got the chocolate croissant. \n\nWow. We tried a little of each others and before we even bit into it your mouth will water. I am a huge fan of cinnamon buns and this was by far the best I have ever had. The cinnamon was plentiful and the frosting was obviously a cream cheese frosting. The dough was very light and airy, like a croissant and melted in your mouth. \n\nThe Jean Philippe Patisserie will be a must every trip to Vegas!! Mouth is starting to water again just thinking about it. Wonder if they deliver"
4,Fabulous!!!!!! Fresh good food!!!!!!! Best Corned Beef Hash!!!!!! Great service! Friendly staff!!!!!!! I just do  not know what these people are talking about. I live in the neighborhood and love this place.
3,"You know what? Jimmy John's makes a doggone good sandwich!! This sub shop opened near my job a little while ago, and I finally had the opportunity to try it out. My office sent me to place an order for 8 subs, which I came back to pick up a few hours later. JJ's had all of the orders correct and labeled with everyone's name. The employees were very friendly and polite, and the restaurant itself was spotless. \n\nWhen I bit into my sub... WOW! The first thing I noticed was the delicious bread! I think I could have eaten just the bread and have been perfectly happy. The rest of the sub was just as good. The meat and fixings were fresh and tasty, and it wasn't skimpy at all. True, it might not be a foot long, but I thought it was a good value for the money.  The fact that they deliver is a bonus as well.\n\nWhile I do prefer my sandwiches warm (I wish they offered that as an option), I was perfectly happy with my #11 from JJ's and will return!!"
3,"omg. so me and my husband came here for our 2yr anniversary at the venetian and ate. I must say we were slightly disappointed, dont get me wrong the food and drinks were great but the environment was so noisey and the seating was awful and uncomfortable. if you're looking for romance dont eat here, but it is pretty good and gorgeous."
0,"Ah yes.  My first Red Robin Gourmet Burger.  Solo lunch on a Friday.\n\nI ordered the Bacon Avacado burger, bunless with steamed broccoli on the side.  My anticipation growing.\n\nFirst bite, dry, well done.  I thought I ordered \""as rare as possible\"".  Avacado?  Nope.  Some tasteless guacamole that likely came from a can.  At least the bacon was good......but $12 for this?\n\nFirst impression was not good.  I've been told its good, maybe they will get a second chance."
4,"Ok, so we knew the chef and he hooked us up with a huge sampling of the best of everything (no exaggeration!).  But I think that even if we paid full price, and only got to try a few of their appetizers and one Paella, I still would be giving Imagine Spain 5 stars.\n\nIt was really slow, and I felt sorry for the staff ... they seemed bored ... so all of you yelpers, go check out Imagine Spain.  It's delicious and more importantly, unique.  That's sometimes hard to find with the mass of cookie-cutter restaurants around here...."
3,"Hidden jewel of Henderson indeed!! A true locals casino. Small but \""charming\"" in its own unique way! Good place to kill time if business ever takes you to the old part of downtown Henderson. Friendly staff ( who remember your name) loose slots and cheap good eats!! The food at the cafe is surprisingly good and satisfying!! Been here twice, and will go back if another errand takes me to that side of town!!! Video poker bar makes good Bloody Marys!!"
1,"I wanted to return an item that I found $21.00 cheaper on Walmart.com (with FREE shipping). I went to take my original purchase back or even ask if they would meet my price, and the two Customer Service Reps. at the front desk, told me absolutely  no. I was very upset that Walmart would not even meet my price. They told me Walmart.com is a separate entity from their company.  I didn't understand this, because Walmart.com delivers to their store.\n\nI called Walmart.com right when I was there and they said, it was up to the manager discretion. I was walking around the store and about to give up, when a clerk Shelbi B. (not allowed to give last name) had not felt right about turning me away. She found me in the store and told me her assistant manager \""Rocky\"" would okay it. If it was not for this busy clerk taking the time to research this and take the extra step, I probably would have walked out of Walmart for good and would shop at Target. \n\nWith the extra effort (which not many people want to do at Walmart), she saved me as a customer. She came across as free thinker and not like some of these \""robots\"" at Walmart that have worked there forever and won't budge.\n\nThank you Shelbi B."
1,"Even though I am impressed with the design of the restaurant, I was disappointed in this Asian eatery. This place is only open from 5pm to 11pm. Who eats dim sum for dinner? It doesn't make sense. \n\nA casual looking guy comes and takes my order. He looked like a regular paying customer. I ordered the Northern Beef Stew based on his recommendation as a good noodle soup. Don't get me wrong, my dish was pretty good, but the service was terrible. My drink was not brought to me even after my dish was brought to my table. I had to ask for it again.\n\nOne of the most important thing that accompanies a noodle soup, is of course a soup spoon. I think it is sad that this was forgotten and I had to ask for that too. On top of that, it was almost $20 for the noodle soup before taxes. It is not worth $20 bucks, especially with the terrible service. In addition, portable chopsticks? I expect real chopsticks.\n\nAfterwards, it was difficult to flag my original waiter down since he was too preoccupied with other customers so I had the hostess bring me the check. I really wanted to like this place, but the lack of service made me quite disinterested."
2,"My wife and I were waiting for the opening of this location. We lived in the area last year and were disappointed as restaurant after restaurant closed in the area. Now let me state up front that I have always been a Mellow Mushroom fan. From the days of the early MMs that went bust about 4 or 5 years ago, to the locations in Greenville and Atlanta. So, giving this location on 3 stars was not easy... because I really went in hoping I would be giving them 4 or 5.\nWe went on a Wednesday night and as expected with most new popular restaurants, there was a long line. Our wait was supposed to be 25-30 minutes and turned out to be about 45. \nWhen we sat down, we waited almost 10 minutes for a waiter to show up. We had two children with us and ordered the PBJ and Mozzarella Meatballs for them. My wife and I ordered the Pizza. We all ordered sodas. The sodas for the kids did NOT come with lids. Now I'm not sure if YOU have ever gone to a restaurant with a two year old, but a drink with a straw and no lid is a recipe for disaster! One point lost there. \nThe kids meals came out after about 20 minutes. Both came with apples and the meatballs came out just right... not too hot for those little fingers and mouth, but warm enough that the cheese was still melted. One point plus there.\nThe problem was this, the Pizza didn't come until a full 25 minutes after the kids meals! They were done eating, the two year old was ready to hit the road and Mom and Dad were JUST starting to eat. Two points lost there!! \nThe pizza was their special. Although it was good... it wasn't special. I couldn't say that there was anything special about it... just average. \nHence my rating. At this point, I would say that the restaurant is NOT child friendly. And to be honest, it wouldn't take a lot to get them to a place where I could say the restaurant is child friendly. They need to work on that.\nThe servers seem confused, at best. The people beside us waited 45 minutes for their Pizza.... and I thought that was a little long for a Pizza. \nSo I wouldn't say no to going again... I will say that it will take me a while to go back. Hopefully they will work out the \""kinks\"" by then."
4,"Best lobster we've had in a long time!\n\nI think the key is to go there for breakfast and be the first ones in line. Everything you get is freshly cooked and it is definitely worth waking your ass up for even though you're hungover. \n\nWe got the lobster mac n cheese, lobsicle, lobster roll, and lobster ice cream. Each dish was better than the next. Amazing!\n\nWe are fans for life and we are already salivating just thinking of the next time we're in Vegas!"

0,"Think before you do business with this guy! Today he cut me off speeding through a business parking lot and when I stopped to ask what his problem was he told me to jump in a lake!  He was in a hurry running into Jimmy John's of all places!! He drives a wrapped car advertising his mobile detail service and car repair business and then tries to cause accidents and will insult people with kids in the back of their car!! He told me I NEED to learn how to drive!  Seriously, I'm in a Costco parking lot and you are complaining? It's not the 101 buddy! \n\nWhile he has not directly serviced my vehicle car with his mobile detailing business - he uses HIS vehicle to get from point A to point B during his business operating hours, marketing his business.  Furthermore, I would have NO clue who this individual was if it wasn't for the fact that his car was logo wrapped and I asked him if he was the owner of the company and he so snidely replied to me, \""yeah, I'm the owner - what, you gonna call and get me in trouble lady hahaha \"". Lastly, the point that I could have been a potential customer, he endangered my livelihood, insulted me, angered me, and caused me emotional distress I think this review is completely VALID!  Business owners should have better public manners if they want to be successful! This is one of the reasons YELP works!"
1,"My wife has been wanting to bring me here to check it out so we did today. She usually goes to the one in Chandler but she thought we'would check this one out instead as it was closer. \n\nThe ambiance of the place left a bit to be desired in my opinion. It didn't seem to have any central theme. Seriously, what's with the metal bull and matador in the men's room...hmmm. Anyhow, there are no booths which I hate - except a couple of half booth tables that were already taken. The music was too soft & low so you can hear people's conversations around you. So yea, I got a couple of eye ball daggers thrown at me. Some woman let her 2 kids run around the dining room like it was Chucky Cheese. \n\nFood was actually rather good, even though it was difficult for me to come up with a good selection with the diet I'm on. We had an appetizer of humus that was artfully displayed on the plate with a dichotomous split  down the middle with jalape\u00f1o cilantro humus on one side and red pepper humus on the other. My wife had the pita bread with it and ordered me some cucumber chips to dip - awesome stuff. You guys have that jalape\u00f1o cilantro humus nailed. \n\nMy wife had a Caribbean salad which looked like it was plucked fresh off the Chiquita Banana Ladies hat. Good looking artfully designed plate. She liked it. \n\nI had a grilled chicken salad and asked for feta cheese on top. Salad looked great but our Patrick Dempsey looking server bolted before I could ask him for additional dressing. I forget that places like this literally spritz a single mist of vinaigrette on the salad in fear of offending Suzy slender bones that she's fat.  Server McDempsey was no where to be found as I waited and waited painstakingly eating the dry salad. He got there eventually and I asked him for the dressing and he said, \""Sure man.\"" Then he went to the busser station and talked with someone, got a drink, rang an order, bussed some plates, and then got my dressing - dude Dempsey WTF. \n\nThe place left a bit to be desired but the food was good. In my opinion you need good food, ambient atmosphere, and efficient service - 1 out of 3 in these economic times ain't bringing me back in.\n\nMoreover, the management staff needs to have a refresher course in hygiene with its employees. Now I'm no clean freak what-so-ever, Christ I used to drink out of the friggin' garden hose when I was a kid - ah who am I kidden, I still do.  Anyhow, I'm looking over at a table with a woman who just sneezed all over the top of her drink - allergies I guess. Well she gets up and leaves and the petite bus girl comes up and bussed the tables and sticks her fingers inside of three glasses in order to carry them away to the bus station. She comes out with a clean rag to wipe the table and fresh silverware roll ups in the soiled hand - nice... Even worse I'm watching server McDempsey talk to another guy employee while he's running his fingers through his gelled hair, scratching his scalp and then rubs his nose with his thumb and index finger. He then goes and serves plates of food to the people next to us. Only good thing - the customer was the frigid woman who shot me the stink eye earlier. Here's to hair gel in your pita lady."
0,"I was here for Memorial Day weekend with friends. I felt like I was dealing with an airline on a transcontinental flight. The line was ridiculous even though we had a table reserved. Once we finally got in we had to wait at the bar while they sorted out our table situation. It turns out the the regulars had come buy and they had oversold the tables. I guess that was ok since it meant not waiting in line for 3 hours.\n\nI've been to many night clubs and I'm told this is one of the best on The Strip. I thought it was pretty average, the girls thought they were cooler than they were and most of the guys were posers trying to hard to look cool.\n\nThe bartneder even \""lost\"" my friend's credit card, claiming she never served him which resulted in an argument where he had to leave to go get a manager. Apparently the hotel is NOT affiliated with the night club and he had to wait in line with a hotel staff member for an hour to get back in. He then had to pay cover again!\n\nShe finally \""found\"" his credit card and the next day he had hundreds of dollars of charges that weren't his on it. \n\nI think this place has too much hype built up for tourists living outside of their means and trying too hard to impress girls that have no brain and no class.\n\nThe music was really good and I did meet some social people but I won't bother going back here again."
4,Two years running I've attended this Feast and had a blast. The food tents are a plenty and I love the scent of all that food mixing together. We first stopped at the Cheesesteak tent and I had one with everything. Absolutely loved that they had cheezwhiz as a cheese selection.  The fresh cut and fried French fries were awesome and so much better than anything you can get a fast-food restaurant;  We grabed some fresh water taffy and being a black licorice fan I made sure to come back to this vendor on my way out and bout a huge length of it to take home. \n\nThe rides were kind of weak but were your typical street fair rides you would find at pop up carnivals around town.  This is a great festival and fun for the entire family!
1,"The food was fine... Fresh and hot and melty cheese.\n\nThe time to table and the service was awful. \n\nMy son and I stopped by on our way home from the gym - we were tired, hungry and sweaty. Placed an order for two 8\"" subs and one 6\"" sub, an order of fries and two drinks. \n\nWe were directed to walk to the other end of the restaurant to pay... Not a problem. \n\nI am waiting to pay. And waiting to pay. And waiting to pay. No one is manning the register - three people working and maybe 8 customers in the store, no one in line and no one is working the register. I send my son to go wash his hands. I am still waiting to pay. I give him the money when he comes back and I go to wash my hands. When I return he is still waiting to pay. \n\nI wasn't about a need to pay for my order... What I really wanted was some cups so we could get our drinks - we were dying of thirst.\n\nI called out to the woman working and asked if we could go ahead and pay. She said sure and then rang up some guy who had just walked in to pick up a to go order. By this time we have literally been standing at the counter for 8 minutes. \n\nEventually she rang us up after ANOTHER to go order... And then told us to sit down and they would bring us our sandwiches. I had to ask her for the cups.\n\nWhen we got the sandwiches they were tasty... For some reason they cut the 6\"" sub in half which seemed silly and the fries were served in the basket with my son's sandwich instead of in a separate cup. \n\nAll in all... Meh. Subway is faster, less expensive and didn't notice a huge difference in taste or quality to convert me..."
0,"I stopped going to this location a few years ago after waiting 45 minutes in an empty dining room for a pizza.  I recently went bac after hearing there was new management. In my opinion things are worse.  There is a manager with reddish hair and a real red face (as if he was high on something) yelling at the servers very loudly .. and very unprofessionally.  Then the server came over to my table and he had a huge bump on his cheek.  Very unnerving. I ordered their Italian Beef Hero and a Pepsi.  Once again I waited too long for my sandwich.  When it came, it looked like they put  2 shaved slices of beef on the sandwich, this was not a \""hero\"" roll, yet it costs nearly $9.00 with tax.. After I paid for my meal and was leaving, a very tall and big man wearing a NYPD pizza tee shirt walked by me smelling like a cross between cigarettes and marijuana. I don't think I'll be going back there again.  Forget the quality of the food, the employees are scary enough."
2,"Get the executive corner suite, it's away from everything.\nI love the enclosed kitchen and extra guest bathroom.\n\nI guess the front desk girls didn't really like me, too bad, I'm more beautiful than them and I'm a paying bitch guest!!\nhaha\n\nThe services from these front desk team can be improved!!\nI felt most of them were real proud idiots!!"
2,"I was torn on how to rate this place.\n\n I guess If it is based on burgers alone it would be 1 star for flavor and price for that little gross thing. \n\nIf it was based on customer service 5 stars for sure, sadly it is by far the best service Ive had in a while\n\nSweet potato fries are for sure a 4 star probably the best damn fries\n\nThe burer though jeeze that thing sucked. I know they have salt because the fries were perfectly salted. For som reason the burger had absolutley no flavor at all.  Scratch that it had an overwhelming flavor of fat but no salt or seasoning. \n\nThey put 2 pieces of an onion on ther even though I paid like a quarte and didnt even get one full slice. If the slider and I really mean slider is like 5 bucks the topping should be free..ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE MEAT WAS FLAVORLESS AND OILY  IT WASNT EVEN GRASS FED. \n\nI could go on and on about that awefull waste of a cow but really the fries were that good I would go back, just for the fries. I would never put another piece of meat from that place in my body. \nI just cant get over the price and the non existant flavor. \n\nUSE SOME SEASONINGS PEOPLE oh and free topping come on. .25 cents for  2 finger nail clipping size pieces of onion. after paying 5 bucks for about 1 oz of meat that tasted like flavorless oil I just cant say anything good about the burger"
4,"We just visited Scottsdale for Baseball Spring Training and have nothing but good things to say about our stay. Staff was extremely friendly, hotel was clean (newly remodeled?), a choice of pools and places to eat, able to get a rental car on site... \n\nWe booked on Priceline, so we didn't get a king room as requested, but nonetheless, the room was nice (and I could use the second bed for my clothes - lol). We had a view of the golf course - ok. We hardly spent any time in the room, so no real complaint there. Had we, then maybe I'd be a bit unhappy, but it gets busy and so - whatever. Shower was great - the shower head was fantastic and able to get a good temp without burning myself... Maybe I have a bad shower at home, but I took a nice long shower and enjoyed every second of it.\n\nWhen we got in, we immediately went to check out the pool. The main one was quite busy - a nice social scene. People with coolers for their drinks. A nice bar by the big pool to sit and socialize. We decided to \""Sangrias\"" to get a bite to eat & something to drink - very good happy hour deals. We took a drink out to the pool, ending up at the round pool - maybe for kids?? Shallow. It was nearing the end of the day so it was nice and quiet. Only a few others were there. We fell asleep in the sun - a nice start to the weekend. \n\nThere are many nice restaurants just down Scottsdale Blvd., if you want to go out - which we did. Made a reservation for Flemings and took an U B E R ride down there... Cost us maybe $8 for uber x on the way there, but a bit more by the end of the night due to availability, $25 round trip... Definitely do-able. \n\nThe next morning we got up and took a car to breakfast. Had I realized they had bikes for rent - I would have done this!! Oh well, next time. \n\nIt turned out we needed a car - we were going more places than anticipated. I for sure thought I would be stuck paying some overpriced rate due to our location / not able to get a car... Well lucky me, I found out that Hertz will let you book a car on their mobile site and bring it right to you. A concierge member will do the contract / etc. I also had to take this car back to the airport, and was able to with NO issue whatsoever. The valet guy was great at helping us get this all arranged, holding the car & bringing the car for us... The daily rate was only $40... \n\nI should say that the staff is very friendly - constantly attending to you if needed (not too pushy / obnoxious, but if you look like you need help - they'll ask). Also, having drinks with my friend at the Sangrias, I returned to my room when we were done. Only to realize after that I had left an entire bag of my belongings (including my phone - hello!!). I immediately did find my iphone on my ipad and ran down to the bar. Freaking out asked if someone had turned in a phone, the waitress said no - so I frantically ran outside / looked where we were sitting. A very nice gentleman followed me and asked to look at the find my iphone - looking to see where the phone was... He helped me look for a bit and then checked with security - someone had turned in my entire bag. HELLO. \n\nVery nice stay overall... I would definitely go back here next time we are in town. Has a lot of amenities and everything in one place. A work conference would be nice here... Maybe not as \""lux\"" for some when they think vacation... But I enjoyed (obviously)."
1,Amazing coffee served to you by miserable people.
3,"I had a large (25 person) dinner here recently and it was wonderful.  Food was excellent, service was beyond great, views were nice (including having shades drawn during daylight that were raised as soon as the sun dipped behind the mountains) and overall great atmosphere.  They even accommodated our quirky requests for bar drinks, letting us take over the reception area and patio, etc.  The only thing that could have possibly been improved was the price (it was a bit high but not unexpectedly so) and some wine recommendations (they have a great wine list, but no sommelier).  There are some adorable tables on the side of the restaurant surrounded by sheer curtains so you can have a view and privacy, I can't wait to go back and eat at one of those tables.  I highly recommend this place for a big group, they made everything easy and memorable. Given the views and the good food, this is also a great place for a fancy date night."
1,"This is my first time coming to Native after the logo has changed ,but the second time overall. My first experience was repeated this next go around. . .\n\nPositives:\n1. The restaurant was clean and considerably \""busy\"" given it was a Tuesday night and no football . . . to my knowledge . . . was on.\n2. Our waiter was friendly, when he showed up. I'll give this a pass as he seemed to be the only one working.\n3. This is an odd positive but i do enjoy booth seating where the booths are large enough to fit more than four people. While that was not needed this time, it was a mental note I made if I come here with a softball group or a impromptu gathering.\n\nNegatives:\nAll of it was related to food . . .\n1. Food was cold.\n2. The wings were smothered in wing sauce. Which is usually a complaint I have, but the sauce was cold.\n3. The beer tasted flat. I am not sure if that was the problem of the restaurant or the brewery but the Kilt Lifter tasted like it had been there for several weeks. \n4. The wrong food came out. . . we didn't say anything to our waiter because we couldn't locate him most of the time, but I doubt the correct order would have been any different as most of it was cold.\n\nThis just isn't going to be a place I want to frequent. Maybe if I am super hungry and there is minimal wait, other than that this place is pretty forgetful."
3,"Lulu's Noodles is a great place to meet a group of people. The atmosphere is fun, and because it's sort of Americanized, even pickier eaters should be able to find something to enjoy. I love the vegetable egg rolls and Japanese eggplant!! The prices are very reasonable as well, which is perfect. It's in a nice location, right near the library, Caliban Books, and Phantom of the Attic."
2,"I've been here for dinner once and twice for brunch. Out of the three times, I would still give it a three star. I honestly don't think the food is that great here even when I come HUNGRY. But I have to admit, they have the presentation on lock-down."
4,"Really good middle eastern food \""fast\""\nGood, quick and healthy \nAwesome place for lunch with a lot of flavors"
1,"I'm a big fan of atmosphere when I go to eat somewhere. I know, judging a fast food restaurant based on ambiance might be a little unfair, but hear me out.\n\nBefore we even made it into the restaurant, we were immediately on edge. The \""hours of operation\"" sign, usually a corporate decal, had been replaced by hand-written hours scribbled on a strip of paper. Not only that, but the aforementioned sign was taped to the glass using the tape they use to close the wrappers on burritos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baja-fresh-mexican-grill-scottsdale-2?select=VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw#VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw.\n\nIf that wasn't enough to put us on edge, there was the issue of the door. The handle was missing a bolt at the top, meaning that the handle swung back and forth if you touched it. When we left, this is what we saw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baja-fresh-mexican-grill-scottsdale-2?select=VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw#eHCSZ4a1Y3GzTaOIXTDucw.\n\nThis location was probably a shining gem when it opened. Those days, however, have long since passed...which is really unfortunate, because the food is actually pretty good. Not only that, but their outdoor patio area is really cool! It has heaters for the winter, and misters for the summer. So much potential...all lost due to lack of upkeep.\n\nThe years have not been kind to this building. Perhaps they could use some of the profits they're making off of their food and use it to maintain their facilities."
3,"My boyfriend and I were planning to go to the other Middleton location, but with the Good Neighbor Festival in high swing, it was a mad-house in the area, so we traveled down the beltline to this location.\n\nThey offer pretty much the same goods and wares as the other locations, but they also have ICE CREAM. If you know me, I just have to give an extra star to any place that has munchies, great coffee, a good wine selection, and ice cream , to boot!"
4,"Called Jeff after the original carpet company I had scheduled no call no showed. Jeff not only explained the whole cleaning process to me but fit worked me into their schedule the same day. That's what I call great customer service. \n\nSo tech Marvin called me to tell me he was on his way and gave me an ETA. He then showed up right on time. He explained what he was going to do and got started immediately. He paid great attention to detail and made sure I was happy with the outcome. I was more than pleased. \n\nIf you need your carpets cleaned, call Jeff and request for Marvin. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. Awesome job guys !!!!!"
1,"I'll give this an add'l star because their chili was tasty. After we were seated it took 20 min. to have a waiter approach our table. We were on the verge of leaving when he arrived with a perfunctory \""sorry\"".  If it weren't for the fact that we were hungry and thirsty we would have went elsewhere. We split the bowl of chili with a fried catfish po boy that was lousy. It hadn't been fried long enough, so there was no real texture. Their idea of seasoning appears to be to dump a boatload of creole seasoning on the nuggets and throw it in the fryer. The remoulade sauce on the side and the coleslaw must have been unremarkable since I remember nothing of them. The only lousy meal we had on the trip. At least the 20 oz. PBR draft was cold and tasty."
4,"The food was amazing! The chicken is amazing, the warm maple syrup and the various southern side dishes are all wonderful. Jake an was our server and he was incredibly attentive, personable and knowledgable. Definitely will be back soon!!"
4,"Looking for a time to have fun with some friends enjoy some comfy as$ couches and smoke that FIRE HOOKAH shoot through here. This is THE SPOT. place big enough to have two parties going on. DJ is off the hook honestly nothing feels better than smoking to hookah listening to Biggie, Tupac, West Coast 562 hip hop, and  new school club bangers. Can't go wrong with the flavors or the prices. I just watched the Lakers beat the Knicks tonight and honestly best place to enjoy it. Shoot through trust me no regrets!"
4,Its really good. Bread is soft. Chipotle chicken avocado is bomb. Salad fresh. Great value in vegas
4,"Our FIRST visit for lunch.  Had a WONDERFUL time.  Greeted at the front door by the manager.  When we sat down, AJ, our server, energetically pointed out all the fantastic food on the menu.  I got the veggie plate with Smothered potatoes, Spicy green beans, fried okra, and mac and cheese.  Was so much, had to take most of it home.  Cornbread was huge with a mound of butter on the top.\n\nMy lunch partners got the fried chicken salad which was great with candied walnuts and avocado.  Another got the Chicken Tender basket.\n\nThe food was incredibly hot, fresh, and delicious.  Service was prompt, friendly, and highly attendant.  \n\nThese folks KNOW how to do it right.  A friendly and welcoming environment.  We will bring our friends and come back soon."
1,"I was not impressed with this place at all. To start out with our service was awful. It took us 20 minuets to get waters, then I think we saw our waitress 2 more times the whole meal. We had the bone in ribeye for two and it was disappointing. They didn't cook it enough but they carved it before asking if ok so they couldn't cook it more. My salad was bad and I left most of it on the plate. I was never asked how anything was. Was thus meal worth $350??"
3,"I've been wanting to try Komex since I read such great reviews on here, and finally I made the leap.  We ordered the full order of combo fried rice, a small cheese quesadilla, a burrito with chicken, and a bulgogi chimichanga at the chefs recommendation.  The chimichanga was mouth watering, so good that the burrito seemed flavorless!   The fried rice was also surprisingly good, my daughter ate it like it was the best meal she'd ever had.  The quesadilla was cooked just right with tasty cheese, but the burrito is where the meal fell short.  It was the first of our order brought to the table, and wasn't hot inside as I expect food to be, but reheated the next day was a nice left over meal!\n\nI will def be frequenting Komex, and the chimichanga will be a staple!"
0,Absolutely disgusting food.  I ordered a carnitas burrito and I found weird mystery balls of fat (filler?). Not sure what is going on in that kitchen but I'd stay away!
0,Garbage is the only nice word that comes to mind
4,"Coffee is great, but we always end there around lunch. My kids get sandwiches and cookies and the last time I had their southwestern egg wrap with egg whites. Yum yum!! I love living up in this area and love having a small mom and pop place to go to."
0,We went to eat ...\nThings that went wrong.. \n1. Guacamole was not fresh it tasted just like the one Costco sells\n2. Chips were stale\n3. I ordered the jambalaya. It looked very good until I got to the rice.. rice was raw\n4. Tomatoe on jambalaya tasted like fr the can\n6. Only had like 2 slices of sausage real thin\n7. Music to to to loud almost blew my ear drum\n8. 45 min to bring warm... not hot food.. just warm\n\nI forgot what my wife order but that was decent\nOn the jambalaya shrimp and chicken was cooked right\n\nNow you are probably wondering why I did not complain.  At that moment my wife was to hungry and I I also did not want to ruin her vegas trip... \n\nWill I ever eat there.... nope.. will I recommend this place nope..... vince u have very good music.... time to step up and fix the issues in your restaurant
1,"The lunch special actually runs all day long, which is fantastic. For two rolls, plus miso and a ginger salad, $10.95 cannot be beat. \n\nHowever, the rolls at full price (I'm not sure when you would get charged that) wouldn't at all be worth it. They are of decent quality, but happen to be very small.\n\nLastly, the impression that I'll have on my mind when considering this place in the future will be of the service. Our waitress did not visit our table at all after serving our meal, which means drinks weren't refilled, plates weren't cleared, and the check was not brought to us. She even stood over us as we filled out the tip on our bill!\n\nGo for the lunch special, and expect nothing more..."
4,"My favorite hotel! My husband and I stay here a couple times a year for business. Nothing in Pittsburgh beats the William Penn, we've stayed at a few other hotels downtown but they never match up. Omni always pays attention to the details. Walking into the lobby makes you feel like you're stepping back in time.  I can't wait to stay there again."
3,"We were looking for a place for a quick dinner before a Phoenix Suns game and decided to try Copper Blues.  It's in CityScape, upstairs about The Corner/ formerly Chloe's Corner.  It was a nice evening so we decided to sit outside, which was lovely.  It was happy hour and they had some great specials going on!  They also have over 60 beers on tap so we tried a few of them.  One in our party had the BBQ Chicken pizza and loved it.  The burgers were excellent as well.  Even though we were outside on the patio with just a few tables our server made sure to check on us regularly. This is definitely a place we'll be returning."
1,"Nothing special.  Has the usual variety of egg dishes, pancakes, omelets, etc.  The wait can be long for weekend brunch.  If it gets longer than 20 minutes, I would just go somewhere else.  It's obviously very popular, but not in a trendy/hip way - more of a classic way.  It's a good place for families."
4,"Great selection of guns n accessories, the guys are helpful and are full of knowledge of their guns. The gun range is nice and cheap. Gun range is 10 bucks and you can use your own ammo instead of buying in house ammo, some places do that but not this place. They have different packages on shooting different machine guns and extoic handguns. This is the place for buying guns and shooting guns."
1,"This chain was kind of a fail. Not an epic fail, mind you. More like a mediocre, \""why the hell did I waste my money on this sub-par lunch\"" fail.\n\nI got a chicken salad salad. Service was 3.5 stars, they were happy to swap out a spinach base for the romaine. Salad didn't really taste like much. A bunch of random ingredients thrown haphazardly together in a massive portion with a huge side of bread. Sort of like eating at the Olive Garden: come for the crappy food, stay for the weight gain.\n\nYeah, I won't be back."
2,I love the products they sell.  I am consistently less impressed with the staff.  There is usually only one person per section who has a clue.  I try to find that person when I have questions.
3,"This place is just A-OK.\n\nBut I give one extra star for being open until 11pm.\n\nI have been saved from fro-yo withdrawal by this extra 1-2 hours of open-time.\n\nThe guys are cool even if you walk in at 10:55pm (which I have done at least 3x in one month).\n\nWhy do I always crave fro-yo right around 9:30pm???\n\nThe fro-yo is not particularly outstanding but it is available, and that makes me happy!"
2,"Average food, ok staff and diner atmosphere. Nothing to write home about. Small portions of brisket. We won't be back."
4,Try the potato cream cheese bread bowl or chicken pesto sandwich. Then relax in Changing Hands afterward..perfect date night!
0,The service was good but the food was overpriced and flavorless.\n\nChicken tenders: greasy and bland.\n\nSteak & Frites: both bland.
4,"Best pad thai in town + it's cheap! \n\nThe place looks simple but don't be fooled, the meal quality is on par with the best (and much more expensive) places out there.\n\nThe owner is also very nice and full of energy.\n\nRecommended."
3,"What The Duce!?\n\nFor starters, where the heck is this place? At first, I wasn't sure if I should be walking in simply because the factory workshop look threw me off!  Um ... hello?  No worries, once we walked into the store area that's when the fun started.  This place really got my interest.  Seems to me you can purchase some vintage items and clothes.  They had stadium-seating area with a projector screen, an ice cream shake area, boxing ring, and a small gym -- where the heck am I!   \n\nWe finally found the restaurant area shortly.  The kitchen is an old school food truck, then again everything about this place is old school; chairs, tables, etc.  I ordered the sliders because it was a recommendation - meatball, chicken sausage, and bbq brisket.  A bottle of coke -- yep it figures.  Meatball sliders were the best of the 3, the sausage was definitely and acquired taste.   My sis, had the eggs and avocado one and it was okay.  \n\nI enjoy my visit to the Duce simply because of it's odd ball nature.  It's definitely an experience wortha visit.  -  Enjoy!"
0,"The food at this place may well be as good as many Yelpers say, but we never got to find out. After driving 6 mi in search of a great local breakfast joint, we arrived at Mr. Mamas to find a short line out the door. We patiently waited at end of the line for the guy to take our name. Another couple arrived at the curb after us, only to be approached immediately by the balding guy with the clipboard, obviously bypassing us. It's clear that this place only wants to serve you if you're white, so if you're not, don't bother coming to this racist joint. There are plenty other restaurants who want our business."
3,"Thank you ABC for carrying Mauna Loa macadamias.  They have the variety 6 tins box and other boxes of one flavour for $24 or pouches for $12.  I always know I can come here and get nuts to stock up at home until my next visit to Vegas or Hawaii! If nuts aren't your thing, there's a lot of Vegas souvenirs to get here like t-shirts and keychains.\n\nAlso great place to get a cold beverage whether it be pop, water (on sale $1 for 1 liter), or alcohol.  We picked up cheap wine, 2 bottles for $12, and a small bottle of Malibu.  If you want a cheap breakfast they carry one serving cereal, pop tarts, and packaged baked goods.  Lots of snack foods and ice cream too.  \n\nABC, I'll be back for more of your nuts next time!"
0,"We haven't been here in awhile and after tonight's visit we will not be back.  There was an odor outside and a little inside and we later figured it out that it smelled like old, nasty grease.  I ordered the prime rib sandwich and it was disgusting - I couldn't even eat it - I left 2/3 of it on my plate and the waitress never even asked if I liked it.  And, to top it all off my husband and I are both sick feeling now because we think their grease was old."
4,"I discovered NStyle through an Elite event where I received a manicure. I enjoyed it so much, I had a pedicure done after the event with the same lady who did my nails. \n\nGreat place! The staff is super friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the work is very good. \nHUGE selection of nail colors! They also have Shellac. It is a very thorough manicure. I think it lasted a good 30 to 40 minutes. They remove your cuticles (some places just push them down without actually trimming the access), which I appreciated greatly. I mini hand massage was included too. All the stations were super clean. No issues there. \n\nI noticed how quiet and private the location was at the time I was there. They are on the 3rd floor (if I remember correctly) of the Place Montreal Trust building which is very nice, and it was pretty easy to find as well. \n\nYou can make appointments on their website and there is a Loyalty Rewards Program... every time you shop at NStyle, you will earn reward points equivalent to 10% of your total bill before tax. How to use the points? Reward points can be used to pay for any NStyle treatment and/or retail products. Once you have accumulated enough points (minimum 1,000), you can redeem your earned points for a discount or pay for a treatment by presenting your NStyle Reward Program card to the front desk.\n\nReturn worthy for sure! Thanks for reading."
4,"This is my GO TO place to take visitors from out of town.  I get them off the Strip or from McCarran and head right over.  There's not one person (out of over a dozen) I've taken who doesn't LOVE this place.  It's usually not super swamped, the concrete floor makes it a bit loud, but I don't care.  The servers are vested and lovely.  Perfect English or Spanish, you pick.  The Ropa Vieja is the best I've had, anywhere.  The combo plate is a good one for guests.  They can try the beef, chicken and pork.  If you like bread, you will find the BEST warm butter bread in Vegas (likely west of the Rockies) here.  OMG!!!!!!!  I DARE you to eat just one piece.  You can't.  Yeah, big ups to this place.  Who says that anymore?  I'm old.  Anyway, just GO.  You will LOVE it!"
1,Went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it. I think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there.\n\nThe service was ridiculous. If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food... at LEAST make sure the menus you hand people are clean. Or your plates for that matter. Or silverware. Seriously! Did EVERYTHING have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance?\n\nNext up... the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal?\n\nI ordered the Coconut Curry Vegetables. Bland bland bland. I've had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen. And would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate?\n\nI guess I just don't understand the hype. The prices are ridiculous for the quality received. You're better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers.
3,"I'm a Harris Teeter guy, but Publix wasn't that bad.  The location was extremely clean and unlike HT, each team member I encountered made sure I found what I was looking for.  It was immaculate.  I loved the signage indicating foods from different cultures and although I can't fully appreciate the entire deli bakery because I don't eat much of what they serve, it was very clean."
3,"This is 1 place I actually like even though yelp only has 3 and a half stars for it. This is a Korean BBQ spot to hit up if your in Vegas. You can order by entree or if your feeling adventurous you can cook your own meat. Like most people we want the food to arrive cooked. I ordered the bulgogi and short rib both dishes were amazing. Bulgogi is my favorite Korean dish. If you never had it, it's shredded like beef seasoned with Korean seasonings. Our entrees came with 5 or so side dishes like pickled tofu, beansprouts, kimchee and other goodies."
0,"On Friday October 3rd my family and I made a reservation for 7 pm, in honor of 2 family members that had just arrived from Chile. I personally have lived for years in Scottsdale, and we wanted to offer our guests a nice dinner, assuming it would be a memorable night, and so it was!! We saw the menu and the prices were reasonable. The waiter Eduardo; he recommended us the special which seemed perfect, the special included tapas and paella for the value of $ 45.00; which he mentioned is was ideal to share since we were a group. We decided to order 2 SPECIALS, for drinks sangria's, 1 coke, 2 glasses of wine and water. Eduardo never showed us in writing this so called SPECIAL; we were told did not appear in the menu. When he brought us the food we got TWO PAELLAS AND TAPAS, ( I have pictures) seem to us was exactly what we order, TWO SPECIALS.\nAfter we finish eating, we asked for the bill to be divided into 2, one of them was for $ 272.44 and the second for a total of $ 202.06; in total we were charged for 474.50. We believed there was a mistake and asked to speak to the waiter, he went to the kitchen and some man came out claiming to be the owner, started laughing sarcastically when we tried to explain the situation, embarrassing everyone at our table, saying we were drunk, and that we were lairs. This man was arrogant and offensive, accusing us of wanting to take advantage of not paying our bill. We decided to call the police. When he saw us dialing he called the police as well. When the police arrived my niece and I explained the situation and what we were being charged; our explanations were not heard and we were forced under pressure to pay such erroneous bill. My recommendation for tourists and residents is ORDER FROM THE MENU, STAY AWAY FORM THE SPECIALS!! PLEASE SEE WE HAVE NOT BEEN THE ONLY ONES, THERE ARE OTHER REVIEWS WITH THE SAME OR VERY SIMILAR EXPERIENCE RELATED TO THE SPECIALS!\n\nAfter all we went through, some of us had to create accounts in YELP to be able to post our reviews and let other people know of our experience, well, the owner or whoever is Nanette G. has replied to some of them, even to ones that are not even us, or related to us, accusing them and us to be lying, that the reviews are false. Mentioning that we struggle to pay our bill, that we had planned since the beginning to skip our bill, that the restaurant called the police first, and so on... who cares who called first, we both called the police; and I answer directly to you Nanette G. of course we struggle to pay our bill, we were not planning on spending almost $500 dollars on food, we never order 7 SPECIALS. Since this is not the first time this restaurant has had this problem, I believe you Nanette G. should approach this issue in a professional way, and not making matters worse, blaming everyone else and not taking responsibility for your staff mistakes, Shame on you!"
2,"\""I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day.\"" ~Frank Sinatra\n\nNothing like a Frank Sinatra quote to start off my Thursday, along with a review of the Wine & Spirits store on Shiloh Street up on Mt. Washington!\n\nLast night on my way to my friend's apartment, I stopped here for a bottle of wine. Red wine to be exact. The store's a little small, but serves its purpose. The only downside was a lot of the shelves were empty, or they were out of my favorites. NOT always a bad thing, it got me to try a bottle of the Chateau St. Jean Cabernet which was awesome! \n\nIt's in a good central location on Mt. Washington and always an easy stop on the way to dinner!"
2,pretty good... and fairly priced!
1,"I really wanted to like this place. Since Luigi's closed on East Blvd, I have been looking for someplace nearby that knows how to make a decent pizza. I ordered plain cheese- no extras. It tasted no better than the frozen kind. The sauce tasted like it came directly out of a jar. No distinct flavor from herbs or spices.The  cheese wasn't good either, it didn't have that gooey/stretchy consistency you get with NY style pizza. It was more like low fat/low quality cheese. The crust was the only part they got right. Just the right amount of crispness. I truly hope they can improve on their product, it's a shame not to.Who doesn't like pizza???"
2,"Kind of a weird dining experience.  Perhaps they are still working out the kinks?\n\nFirst, I checked out the menu and saw there were basically no vegetarian options.  So, I asked the person at the front if they have vegetarian food.  She said they can make a vegetarian version of lots of stuff.  I asked if they can make the lettuce wraps vegetarian.  She said no.  We tried it anyway because we were on the brink of dying of starvation, the line for the buffet was a trillion miles long, and the wait at Anthony's Burgers & Brews was 30 minutes.\n\nI asked the server what vegetarian options they have.  She said they can make 90% of the menu vegetarian.  I asked if they can make vegetarian lettuce wraps, she said no.\n\nI looked at the menu.  Hmm.  Not sure how you'd make salmon, lobster, or chicken vegetarian.  So, the \""90%\"" thing is definitely not true.  I decided on the chow mein without meat.  There were no offers to sub with tofu or anything.\n\nMy brother asked again, is there any way they can just make the lettuce wraps with tofu instead of meat?  Our server checked with the chef, and, miracles of miracles, they were able to do it.  Awesome, but weird that we basically had to beg them to try.\n\nI also tried the veggie rolls.  Nothing special, I'd skip it next time.\n\nThe food was all okay - nothing amazing, but the prices were pretty good for a Casino restaurant in Vegas.  The made a mistake on one thing and fixed it right away.\n\nThe chef came over to ask how everything was, I told her they should put more vegetarian stuff on the menu.  She said they can make most of the things on the menu without meat.  Oy, for the millionth time, JUST PUT IT ON THE MENU THEN!  (I did not watch Restaurant Express and therefore was not star struck by the chef, she was nice though.)"
2,"I read the yelp reviews and had high expectations. Great social setting and really good ambiance. Nice selection of margaritas  which is a must for a good Mexican restaurant. The claimed house special is pork shoulder. Unfortunately, I came away disappointed. It was dry from the long smoke which means the meat was not wrapped or injected. Apps were good to very good and the guac was very good. Nice blend of jalape\u00f1os, Serrano and chipotle pur\u00e9e. Overpriced but at least every dish is made to order."
2,"An old hotel/casino on Fremont.  The building is old and so are its occupants and players.  The hotel is part of the old strip or \""Old Vegas\"" as some people call it.\n\nFor about $45/night, you get what you would expect for any other budget hotel in Vegas.  There's wifi internet there, but you'll have to pay extra.  The building goes up to like 20 floor.  They have room service if you want to pay for it, but the menu is small and steep.  The room service did a fine job of cleaning and making our beds.  They have an in room safe for you to use too.  Some of the rooms have old CRT TVs and others have LCDs.\n\nOn the bottom floor, you'll find a bar that charges $4 for a bottle of beer (you can go outside across the street and get one for $2).  It has a small cafeteria place consisting from Dreyer's icecream, Subway, and a small pizza joint, all run by the same people.  Two other restaurants there, the Cellar (leads to some sort of basement or cellar, duh) and Magnolia that leads up to an balcony height restaurant.  TIP:  pull the 1 free play slot machine and get a flyer for coupons and sign up for the Royal Player Club card (for free) and cash in those coupons.  They'll save you a lot of money if you're planning to eat at the restaurant.\n\nI was staying there for Market Week, and there's a charter bus that went to and from there and the World Trade Center.  Since it's on Fremont, every hour, on the hour, you'll definitely hear the show from the \""WORLD'S BIGGEST TV SCREEN\"" from your room.  Incase for those you that don't know, there have a giant video show the lines Fremont Street, worth a look.\n\nSure the hotel isn't a looker, but for $45 bucks, we didn't really care since we were just there for Market Week."
2,The Truffle Burger was good.  A decent sized burger that was juicy and tasty. The truffle aoli sauce was oozing out.  The Bun had a big U logo toasted on top.  Nice touch.  Had it with the Panko Onion Rings which were light and crispy.  Awesome home made ketchup for dipping.
3,"3.5 stars rounded up for value.  First, I think you have to come in with regular expectations.  If you come in expecting a Four Seasons type buffet, of course you will be disappointed.  I stayed at the Stratosphere and tried the dinner buffet once ($21) at 4pm and breakfast buffet  ($18) once around 8am.    Both were totally acceptable and fine.  At dinner I tried the Mexican bar, the Chinese bar and Dessert section.  Pork tamale was flavorful, there were flour tortillas, condiments, etc.   Chinese food (fried rice, chicken wings, beef, noodles, etc.) was good---beef  and chicken were very tender (I was pleasantly surprised).  I was especially surprised by the dessert bar.  Cake was moist, as were the cookies and bread pudding.  At breakfast I tried the chorizo eggs, various types of hash, biscuit with gravy, a dollar sized pancake and french toast.  Biscuit was fairly dry but that is not a surprise at any buffet but the pancake, while not made to order, was also nicely soft.  \n\nI am frequent patron of high end buffets in LA  which cost $70-$100 per person (Four Seasons, Ritz, etc.).  Stratosphere is of course not on that level, but it IS a great bargain at $21.  If I stayed at the hotel again, I'd absolutely eat there again as well."
0,Nice hotel. Not so great service. It was my birthday get away and my husband scheduled some surprises (after several confirmations) that were not fulfilled by staff. The hotel was a ghost town and they still didn't deliver. Not cool.
3,"This place isn't as good as Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil, but for a place in a mall on the strip its quite good.  The service has been favorable both of the times I've dined here.  The meats are flavorful and well cooked.  The chicken is pretty good too.  The shrimp and crabcakes are tasty but the fish isn't anything special.  The salad bar is so much more than that.  It has some very delicious items: calamari salad, fresh mozzarella, antipasti, soup, side dishes, and the tasty cheese bread puffs.  The tiramisu is awesome, but the cocktails are sub standard.  Try it out and get a groupon or amazon local coupon."
4,"This is one of my new favorite restaurants. I have been twice now and I can't wait for my next visit! Both times I went with a group of friends and everything we ordered was excellent. The pizza was amazing! Dessert was devoured in a frenzy. The ambiance was perfect. This is a great place for a date or a night out with the girls. Also, a wonderful place to take visitors. If I lived closer I would be there every week."
3,"Fun and different, this is a good break from the Strip. Home of The Heart Attack Grille - you gotta see this - and a zillion little shops, kiosks, and bars. Lots of other quirky stuff to see and do, and the people-watching is tops. Don't miss the light show at night, and watch for bums and pickpockets - yes, it's that kind of area."
1,"We started off with a breadbasket and shared a very good Caesar salad. This restaurant, like most of the Station Casino steakhouses, currently offers a $14.99 prime rib special that, in this case, included garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Our animal protein, weighing is at close to a pound, was cooked medium rare as requested, but the quality was somewhat south of prime.  Justin, our server, was light-hearted while maintaining a professional level of competence.  Overall the meal was satisfying and represented a good value."
0,"This company is the worst. They send coupons all the time. We try them online and they work for the products selected. We go to the store (to keep the damn thing open and people in their jobs, online is feeding the unemployment in the country) and the cashiers always make an excuse why the coupons will not work. It is ridiculous. If it works online, it works in the store just the same, you're just being lazy."
0,Long waits to speak to an attendant. Then they lie repeatedly about the estimated time of arrival.  Finally the taxi never showed.  Avoid this shitty company.
0,This is my first time coming here and my last I place my order at 7:24pm I'm just now getting my food at 7:52pm the rest of the employees was moving Hella slow well at least the employee say thank you
3,"My good friend and Muse said we were doing to Jamms. \n\nJamms?  Okay...it's a cool name. I had no idea what to expect.  \""Just please don't take me to any hoodrat establishments, bet?\""\n\nI've NEVER done much of anything off the strip in Vegas..and so with me now having a good friend who lives there...anyway...\n\nShe took me to Jamms and it was the funk!\n\nI had the Signature (steak) omelet, and french toast made with CORN FLAKE BATTER. Whaaaat???\n\nShe had the Country Skillett and an order of the Pot-O-Bread. (She was sweet enough to get me one to go). GOOD STUFF.!!! It's like a little..pot..of...sweet bread (blueberry, cinnamon)...\n\nIf you're ever in Vegas, you'll have plenty of nice buffet eating (Bellagiio, MGM Grand...)...but if you wanna venture off the strip...go to Jamms.\n\nJamms is the funk!"
2,"We have renamed this place Airport Sushi. It takes like sushi you get  at the airport. That isn't necessarily bad, it's just not necessarily great."
0,Unhappy employees and poor management. Always out of any sale items and the employees look at you like you just insulted them every time your there..
2,"My wife and I love to try new places and hope we love it so i can give a good review. There are usually way too many negative reviews because only disappointed people are the ones writing. Sorry to say my review is not a glowing one.\nMelrose Kitchen seems very average to me. It gets three stars for good service, fun decor and really good prices. My eggs benedict was good, but nothing super special. Biscuits and gravy were floury and not good. The biscuits were nothing special. \nI suppose it is not fair to judge a restaurant from one visit..but when it comes to biscuits and gravy, you can in deed judge a breakfast place on that. Unless it was just a bad day with the cook..I suggest changing the gravy recipe. \nI will try it again though. Probably lunch. If all goes well I hope to be able to give a better review."
0,"My favorite thing about going to Vegas is trying new clubs, restaurants, and hotels. I was excited yet hesitant to spend my 22nd birthday at Lavo this year (10/10) because of the lack of reviews and hype surrounding the club. I made reservations to Pure as well (one of my all time favorite clubs). After a promoted pretty much talked my group into at least checking it out, the night began. \n\nFirst off Lavo is TINY. Even with table service, all the tables/couches are squeezed together and it doesn't provide you with the ultimate experience because everyone is stuffed in like sausages and it made it easy for people to just walk up and dance and sit in your space. There was no separation from the regular dancing area. \n\nSecond, the service is less than impressive. Our table server Megan was rude did not help make the occasion special but actually took away from the experience.\n\nThird, the music was horrible and even intoxicated found it difficult to dance too.\n\nAnd finally after only one bottle of kettle one was consumed we were kicked out without warning because they thought my friend was \""too drunk\"". With a whole bottle left you can imagine I was less than thrilled. \n\nI couldn't believe this club shares an owner with Tao, it was awful and I will never be going back. Please don't make the same mistake I did, and go somwhere else (Tao, Pure, LAX, Rain)."
4,Great atmosphere. Fun place
2,"The waitresses are surly.  It's kind of annoying.  But the food is decent.  I especially like the spaghetti with oil and garlic.  I always forget not to order salads, though.  They need to invest in a salad-spinner, if they're not watering down their dressings."
3,"Very good for what it is- cheap, tasty bar food. Everything on the menu is fried and/or covered in cheese. I like to wash it down with a $5 pitcher of Blue Moon during happy hour, kick back, and wait for the inevtiable stomach cramps to arrive. It's a good pain."
2,"It seems like every restaurant and bar concept has been tried at this location but nothing has ever stuck for one reason or another.  This building has been several different bars, several different restaurants, and most recently a Dillon's BBQ restaurant.  Will the newest concept stick?  Well, if it does, they'll need to improve on the quality of the food in my opinion.\n\nMy brother and I came here by chance while driving north on Central Avenue.  The place bumps right up against the canal midway between Northern and Dunlap.  The namesake is very much geared toward the many bikers and runners who traverse the historic Murphy Bridle Path from Bethany Home road to where the Path ends right here.  They even give discounts to folks to ride their bike here instead of their cars.  Great way to get patrons in the door.\n\nThe interior is pretty roomy (bordering on cavernous) with booths against the wall, a bar, and tables in the middle.  The patio in the back is right up against the canal on one side and Central Ave on the other.  There were flat screen TVs at every booth tuned to football so we went with a booth.\n\nNone of the main entrees appealed to me at the time so I actually went with the sausage and soft pretzel platter.  I love sausage and I love pretzels, so why not.  It was served with two different Schreiner's sausages, two small pretzel rolls, a cheese dip and potatoes.  The sausages were very good, though I was disappointed with the portion sizes.  The platter is meant to serve two but I easily took the sausages myself as the portion size was relatively small.  The potatoes I got with the platter were also super dry and tasted like they'd been stuck under a heat lamp for awhile.  The cheese dip was pretty good and was a decent compliment to the pretzel rolls, but not necessarily the sausages.\n\nOverall, the place was sort of meh.  The food was acceptable, but didn't wow me.  The vibe of the restaurant didn't excite me, though this place would work very well as a place to watch the NFL on Sundays with all the TVs they have in there.  And I like the concept of catering to the neighborhood bridle path crowd.  But if my dish was any indication of the rest of their menu, they should focus their improvement efforts on the food."
0,"When I pulled up to this place, I broke my first rule of dining:\n\nNever eat at a place with more wait staff than tables with customers. \n\nI found the food to be between 3.5 to 4.5 stars, depending on the dish, enough points to earn my revisit. However, the customer service was below 1 star. I read similar reviews stating the food is great but the service sucks, which couldn't be more true. My interaction was with one waitress in particular who forgot our drink order, then forgot our food order, then forgot to bring us chips and water (4 times she mentioned she would get the chips before they actually arrived). \n\nFor food, I recommend the carne asada tacos which were delicious. I would pass on the nachos or anything that requires chips to eat since they are not freshly prepared. \n\nFor service, I recommend not coming at all. Maybe.. Maybe get it to go if it is offered. But I can't stress enough how bad the service is to warrant a 1 star review  \n\nThank you for reading."
4,"This Goodwill is much better than many I've been to, in fact it may be my favorite one, and I really know my way around the Valley's second hand stores...  The store is clean and bright, the employees are very friendly, the aisles are organized and it doesn't smell like grandma's underwear drawer.  \n\nA big bonus for me is their $1 Thursdays: Everything with that day's colored tag is $1.  You can find some AWESOME stuff for just a buck.  SCORE!"
1,"The atmosphere is like any other chain sports bar, service was bad, and I don't think I will be returning. Nothing stood out about this place with so many other great options just a block away."
4,My favorite place in Pittsburgh! The crispy  tofu there is so amazing! My next best dish is the thakkali curry.. The drinks specially the Asian plum sangria is fantastic.. Love the ambience! It's like a place in New York. Good veggie options.
4,"Wiggles and Wags is awesome.  Before we found them, my husband and I always had people come to our home and watch our dogs because they are pampered pooches...  However, one trip came up and we couldn't get a sitter, so we decided to try and board them.  We had heard horror stories from people about other shelters, so we really did our research.\n\nWhen we called Wiggles and Wags, they were brand new.  They encouraged us to come over and visit them before we made our decision to ask questions and see how everything worked.  When we arrived, we were blown away.  The owners are so kind, and the facilities are perfect.  They keep the dogs in plexiglass suites instead of chainlink kennels, and the property was very clean.  Even though it is in a strip mall, there is a dog run area out back where they take the dogs every 2 hours or so to play.  Out back there is some agility equipment and an area to run around in.\n\nThe prices are fair.  It costs about 50 bucks a night for our 2 dogs in a fairly good sized suite.  I like that we can drop off the dogs the morning of our trip and pick them up in the evening of our return and they don't ding you on the pickup/drop off time differences.  \n\nThe staff is super nice and you can tell that they really love their jobs and the animals.\n\nLove, love, love!"
3,"A genuine mom & pop restaurant right out of the 1950's. No I do not mean phony posters of Elvis on the wall or poodle skirts on the waitresses. I mean honest home cooking for an honest price; for those too young to remember the 50's there were no Elvis posters or waitstaff in poodle skirts in the restaurants at that time.\nThe first thing that hit my eye upon entering was a genuine ugly green Hamilton Beach malted machine on the counter. Yes I did have a milk shake with my lunch - they had no malt otherwise I would have had a malted.\nThe pecan chicken is excellent and a turkey BLT was very good, as was the potato wedges that came with them. \nI see some folks had a bad experience with service. Either the staff has been retrained or those experiences were anomalies as we experienced friendly and very attentive service.\nI recommend this place for very good food at an honest price; portions are on the large size and you may need to bring some home for the next day's meal. If you can handle it have a chocolate milk shake with lunch and bring back your youth.\nOne last thought. For those who do remember the 50's bring your readers as the print on the menus is not large and the lighting is a bit dim."
1,"I went here last month when it was $3.99 for their anniversary. A drink cup was $1.79. Most of the pizza tasted like the 99\u00a2 frozen pizza you get at the grocery store. Had about 8 slices, a small plate of salad, and some of there cinnamon rolls and brownies. \n\nIf not for the excellent customer service, I would have given them only 1 star. I wanted to try the mac & cheese pizza after reading some of the reviews here and I didn't see any. I asked the manager and he asked me how many slices I wanted, gave me an orange cone and said he wold bring it to me when it came out of the oven."
3,"This is a hidden gem in downtown breakfast options. \n\nAfter talking to the owner, I learned that the cafe used to be in Lawrenceville, but has been located Downtown most of 2013. Lawrenceville's loss is Downtown's gain. The large space is softened by lots of green houseplants and tables for 2 accented by art deco lamps. The larger high-top tables fit about 4 people, so this isn't a good place for big groups. \n\nThe food is cooked to order, but while you wait you are served fresh slices of baguette, jam, and butter to tide you over. The individual breakfasts are served piping hot and quite tasty. My husband especially enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros with its fresh roasted vegetables, spicy sauce, and home-cooked beans. I was a big fan of the super-fluffy Greek Omelette. Lastly, they serve big cups of La Prima coffee. \n\nIf you want a hearty vegetarian breakfast before going to the Convention Center, this is the place to go. \n\nAs an aside, some of the reviews mention the surly owner/cook, but I'm happy to report that he has hired a waitress who is very friendly. I found the owner to be a bit gruff but friendly."
2,"The top-notch service at Le Cirque matched the price of the dinner.  Sadly, the food did not.  The lobster appetizer with truffles was just okay.  It sounded great but the flavors just didn't gel.  Perhaps it's because it was served too cold.  I had the rabbit for my main course and my husband had the duck.  The rabbit dish was very creative and delicious.  The duck was pretty good.  The best course, by far, was the dessert.   Overall, however, the food was forgettable.  For the price, it just wasn't worth it."
2,"Quick and easy place to eat, our waiter was very helpful. I had duck noodle soup. It was good, but it was a bit oily."
2,I wanted some crab legs so we went to Chart around 12:00p. We sat by the fish tank which was more exciting than the food. I orded the Alaskan King Crab Legs about a pound and a half for 55.00 they came split but they were dry. My friend had the short ribs they were tender and off the bone. I had fried rice it was dry. We had the hummus which was my first time eating it and I will never eat it again. The service was good but the food not so much.
4,"This place is fantastic! I somehow ended up buying 3 dozen cupcakes in a 3 week period with friend's birthdays so close this summer. The price is well worth it, even though it make seem steep.  Remember you get what you pay for and in reality these little bits of heaven should cost way more. I generally go in and get 12 different cupcakes and a menu to identify them. Then everyone gets to pick out a different one. Plus identifying the cupcakes based on their descriptions is quite fun!"
0,"We went for lunch on a Saturday.  Without doubt, we were served left-overs from the previous night's dinner.  The fries were not even warm, and they were hard, the brisket and ribs were luke-warm and we could see everything getting reheated in the microwave including the Mac and cheese for our kid that had a generous layer of melted grease on top.  We asked to sub the sweet fries with regular fries because those looked more fresh and cooked to order but we ended up giving up and leaving the place to eat across the street @ indulge burger before they got the replacement fries order to us.  Never again - food was not edible.  Perhaps dinner is different but won't be going back to find out.  If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  Terrible experience."
0,"Terrible.  Came to watch the Panthers game with my daughter and after a drunk woman took our seats, I was told I was in the wrong.  A \"" manager\"" Tony Donnelson came out to our section and yelled at us when everyone on the patio witnessed what happened.  He was unprofessional and acted like a bouncer not a manager.  He saw he was making my daughter cry and continued to confront us until I suggested to speak inside.  At this point I took my crying daughter and left.  Didn't receive any apology or even told who I was speaking to.  I had to request information to speak to a GM and was given the store number.  Never have I been treated this way and my daughter is still upset.  Tony Donnelson should be ashamed of himself!"
0,"I confess. I thought that the negative reviews could be \""overly harsh\"" or somehow, just plain wrong. And for that, I apologize.\n\nNot one bird there seemed to be well-adjusted pet material. Flocks of  smaller birds (read quakers, conures) were in 50? gallon aquariums. Maybe smaller. None of them seemed used to being handled. The large birds that were out of their cages all showed signs of distress - only about 1/3 of the birds had any of their long tailfeathers, about 1/2 showed obvious signs of feather plucking in the form of bare patches across back or chest. In the back were amazons, african greys, and other parrots of similar size in birds in cages I MIGHT have temporarily put budgies in. I didn't have the heart to look at them all.\n\nTheir selection of food, overpriced toys, and other accessories was better than the average pet store, but how can I justify spending money here? I'm looking elsewhere. Ugh."
2,"I am always a fan of non-chain locally owned restaurants, so after hearing the buzz about here, I eagerly made plans to eat in. Despite my enthusiasm, in the end it was just ok. Service was fine, if not a little overeager/borderline pushy at suggesting apps/drinks/dessert. Interestingly, none of the wait staff was at all familiar with the Yelp check in coupon for a free soda- looked at me like i was nuts, taking my phone off to seek clarification. Ambiance (ate outdoors) is on the right track, but there is so much more which could be done to truly make a statement. Went with two entrees which were ok, but overall unremarkable, and even less so considering the price. The seafood bouillabaisse was \""center of the road\"" with the portion slighty smaller than expected, especially for the price. Other seafood entree was a step above bland, but again not representative of the price point. The sangria I would def not recommend, tasting like uninspired fruit juice. In the end, the makings are there for a potential winner, but price or quality would need to improve for me to get behind this restaurant."
4,"I was really excited to try this place after reading a lot about it and seeing it featured on Anthony Bourdain's \""The Layover\"".  It did not disappoint!  The service was good and our waitress was friendly and knowledgable.   The menu looked really good and it was hard to choose what to eat.\n\nWe were a group of 3 and decided to split some appetizers to start.  We ordered the horse tartar and the foie gras double down both of which were quite good.  I especially liked the foie gras double down.  Split 3 ways it was fine for the portion size so I recommend splitting it if you intend to try it.\n\nI had the rabbit as my maiin dish which came with a side of spaetzle (German  dumpling)s.  Portion size was a bit too big and I had to leave some of it behind but the taste was excellent.  The rabbit was very moist and full of flavour.\n\nFor dessert I tried the Joe Beef sundae which was okay but I don't think I'd get it again.  Honestly if I were to go back I'd probably skip dessert altogether just because  I was already so full from the rest of the meal. \n\nI really enjoyed my experience here and would jump at the chance to go back in a heartbeat."
1,"Avoid the buffet  if you don't want to feel heavy the whole day, little overpriced"
3,"\""What do you want for dinner tonight?\""\n\""Eh, I don't know. I don't feel like cooking. How about you?\""\n\""Meh, I don't feel like washing the dishes...\""\n\""Miele's?\""\n\""MIELE'S!\""\n\nAbsolutely no nonsense. Prompt service. Good food at great prices. Welcoming but non-pretentious atmosphere.  Miele's isn't the best Italian out there - some local, fresher ingredients and a little more attention to seasoning might help the flavors - but it gives great value for the money.\n\nBonus points: excellent desserts. Try the cheesecake or the chocolate mousse."
0,"I would give it -10000 stars if i could!! I hate this place!! Girls in high heels....DO NOT GO! the slightest stumble if your shoes hurt your feeet and you will not get in!! Bouncer is an a-hole!!!

They want girls in heels yet they dont know what it is to walk in them...fk ya all!! They are classier places in vegas then this sh*tty place!!"
4,"Farren's has an awesome burger. My burger had a very thick patty, bleu cheese, bacon, saut\u00e9ed onions, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, lettuce, and onion. The patty was very thick and juicy, and the buns were fantastic. The burgers come with tortilla chips, but you can substitute the chips for fries or onion rings at an additional cost. The burger alone costs between $8-9, and you will be paying around $9-13 for your entire meal, depending on what extras/substitutes you get. I will definitely be coming back here again."
0,Pizza had good flavor but the dough was really rubbery it was like chewing steak would not ever go again.
4,"I Brought in some shorts to be altered here- the owner is a sweetheart, was accommodating and nice.\nNot to mention she's located close to ASU so it's great for students like me to get any thing done they need to their clothes.\n\nThe most important thing- good vibes.\n\nIgnore the negative reviews- I'm sure if they were in even a slightly good mood they would appreciate the obvious experience and welcomingness of the store - not to mention I'm sure the owner would have fixed anything had they simply kindly asked.\n\n\nThank you ill be back for my alteration needs!"
0,If your thinking about coming here think again. The place has been out of business for a few months.
2,I give Pho Real a 3 star because it's close to home. I get my usual fresh shrimp rolls (which is hard to mess up) and pho dac biet.  I'm usually in and out in less than half hour which is awesome for me because I really don't have a lot of time to get a good meal and I hate fast food. \n\nI would give it one more star but I'm half Vietnamese so I'm partial to my own pho :)
4,I loved my experience. I never felt rushed at appointments and our whole family was welcome. All of the reasons that would require transfer to the hospital were explained ahead of time so there would be no surprises. I was very happy with her manner during labor as well.
0,"I went to this vet for a few years.  They seemed fine when my pet was rather healthy, but as she got older, she seemed to get odd diagnosis.  I continued with their prescription treatments for a week, but my pet didn't get any better, so like any good \""mom\"", I got a second opinion elsewhere.  It was a night and day difference!!  Central Phoenix Animal Hospital had said my pet had a parasite, something that is diagnosed with a easy test...the new vet did the same test and said \""NO WAY!!\""  My pet ACTUALLY had hyper thyroidism, not a parasite.  (my pet NEVER goes outside, so I thought it was weird that he would get a parasite).  After 7 days on the proper medication, my pet was healthy and back to normal.  This vet also misdiagnosed another issue my pet had...like REALLY MISdiagnosed her (saying she broke a bone...SHE DIDN'T!!!).  I felt sick about it.  I also didn't like the way they handled my pet when she was injured...I know they want to protect themselves, but they were REALLY rough with her (I offered to help, but they just manhandled her instead.)  \n\nIf you have an adorable little healthy puppy or healthy kitty, they're fine.  They're actually pretty nice usually and I know they probably help out a lot of people who don't have much money (I saw a few instances of people not having a lot of money and they'd work with them), but, if you really need GOOD vet care, I'd go somewhere else.  \n\nOh yeah...the last time I was in there, they were joking around in the lobby and two women came out of one of the examine rooms, obviously upset, crying, etc. It was obvious that they just had to put their animal down.  No one stopped joking and laughing...they just yucked it up while these two women fought back sobbing...it was so sad.  I wanted to give these two strangers a hug and kind word and then slap the employees for being so cold and insensitive.  Inappropriate."
2,Good Margaritas and nice staff they always make me feel right at home. My favorite plates to order here are the Street Tacos and the Chicken Spinach Enchiladas.
3,I've heard very good things about Monta. The wait was pretty long because it's a pretty small place but it was worth it. I got the Miso ramen and it was pretty good but too salty for me. Next time I go I'll be sure to try a different one.
3,"Definitely great authentic Pakistani good. Not as good as Pakwan in the bay area, but their Nihari was really good. Naan was fresh. Hole in the wall good food and really cheap too. \n\nWould definitely return here if for some reason I ever found myself in Kitchener, Ontario ever again. However, if you are here and are looking for great Paki / desi food, then this is the place to go."
4,"We used to go to Carolina's regularly, but after reading reviews on Juan's, I thought I would give them a try. Have never gone back to Carolina's. \nThe food served at Juan's is delicious and cheap. Their nachos with guac and machaca are the best I have ever had. The service is quick and I always feel at home there. I try to go once a week, and I never walked out disappointed.  For me, that's great atmosphere. They sure sodas in huge glasses, as is their generous portions.\nTheir green corn tamales are the best, as is their green enchilada sauce. Also a favorite are their cheese crisps, machaca enchilada and ground beef tacos. Try their sopapillas for desert."
4,"This is an addictive place. Aside from their great customer service, their product is simply excellent. I am big fan of their red bean smoothie, Vietnamese coffee, and their snow. Now, I have a new addiction. I highly recommend the mocha smoothie. \nNot the healthiest thing in the world though. \n\nOf course....it doesn't hurt with all the eye candy either."
4,"Dined in over Father's Day weekend and loved it! The sashimi plate was so fresh and was one of the best sushi places we have eaten since Hawaii. All the sushi we had has delicious we ordered 8 different kinds. Great service, we had two little ones and the waitresses were great with them, even had them feed the fish! So nice we will be coming back for sure. Left a great impression"
3,"What a beautiful place to sit with friends around the fire and enjoy some wine and food!  The fish fish tacos got the group vote for the fav HH food.  The crab cake cake was tiny and not impressive.  Whereas the cheese plate was more savory with a little something for everyone.  If you are looking for a patio setting, then you can't go wrong here."
0,"This is NOT a show for true Elvis fans. I am a member of 2 local Elvis fan clubs in town and I can honestly say that this show offended me on so many levels. I think that if you're not aware of Elvis and the history of him becoming the King of Rock and Roll, you might actually enjoy it more. \n\nThey turned one song into a reggae version? They had a big Blue Suede shoe as a prop that dancers were sliding off of? Colonel effin Parker narrates it??? There are comic book heroes bouncing off of trampolines? \n\nThe list goes on as to why I could barely sit through this show. Maybe an Elvis impersonator should have been used, maybe the whole dang production needs to be rewritten. I don't know what could salvage this mess. I only know that as an Elvis fan I am greatly saddened that this show didn't turn out better. I talked to one of the local Elvis impersonators wives' last week after she saw the show and she had the exact same reaction. She agreed that if we knew less about Elvis, it might have been more enjoyable. \n\nSo if you're a HUGE Elvis fan steer clear. If you're not totally familiar with him but enjoy his music you might like it, but that's a big 'MIGHT'"
3,"In the lobby of the Hard Rock Hotel, this place is trendy chic meets BBQ Steakhouse.  The staff a a bunch of young hip cute kids who move fast, and give friendly helpful service with a smile.  The menu has lots of good options of comfort foods. I would call it comfort food chic.They have some really tasty options in beers too. We had the fresh made chips with the onion dip, which was tasty. I had Meatloaf dinner and they even add the grilled the bread I wanted without a problem. Perfectly tasty!! My husband says the ribs are good, coleslaw excellent but $27?? Get a blue berry beer while you wait."
4,We still love this place. The new faves are their homemade Ranch on fries and the fish machaca taco... We have even sampled the quesadilla (try El gobernador)... All delish. The owner will make suggestions for what to choose on the salsa bar with your tacos.
2,"This is not what I imagined at all. The ambience was lounge like rather than a nice intimate setting. \n\nOverpriced for what you receive and overall quality was AVERAGE. We ordered Antipasta and main courses and they simply did not WOW us. The wine list was not very good for reds.  \n\nService was not great at all - waited extensively after each interaction.  \n\nI do not recommend this place - go to Prime, Mortons or Lavo instead and you will be much happier."
2,"Earlier this year, we fell for currywurst, the ultimate street food, at a fantastic place in Hollywood called Berlin Currywurst. It left us wishful for a comparable place near home. \n\nI heard about Cafe Berlin on the west side near Decatur/215. We recently stopped in for dinner. We were warmly greeted and led to a table for two. My husband had currywurst with potato salad and I could resist the comfort of J\u00e4gerschnitzel and spaetzle. Food was served timely. The currywurst wasn't appealing to the eye, but I couldn't wait to dig into the schnitzel. \n\nThe schnitzel was delicious. Better then Cafe Heidelberg and world's better than Hofbr\u00e4uhaus. Tender pork, crisp breading, creamy mushroom sauce. It could've only been better washed down with a full stein. Hopefully, they'll get their liquor license soon.\n\nNow, the currywurst, on the other hand, wasn't up to par. The sauce itself was quite good, but the sausage? It was terribly fatty. The texture was very unpleasant. After a few bites we could eat no more. Fortunately, the schnitzel was enough for two. \n\nWe were a bit bummed we came up empty on the currywurst, but it was nice to find a well prepared schnitzel."
2,"I used to stay at the Luxor all the time and never had any problem. Definitely stay in the towers and not the pyramid. The non-smoking rooms in the pyramid still smell like smoke. The towers are newer and rooms are larger than in the pyramid. Food sucks at Luxor, so go to another casino for fine dining."
0,"I have been going to this dentist for about 5 years now, and I have never had any issues until this last time.  I had to go in for my routing cleaning and everything went fine until the hygenist came to clean my teeth.  First of all, she was not friendly at all, not a 'hi, how are you today' nothing. She cleaned my teeth and when she was almost done, somehow the powder they use to polish your teeth, went ALL OVER ME.  All over my face, the chair, my neck, everywhere! Instead of apologizing for what happened, she just said in a matter-of-fact and non apologetic sort of way, \""You need to go to the bathroom and clean it off your face.  The bathroom is right around the corner.\"" OMG! After i got cleaned up (luckily I didn't have to go to work!), she didn't finish or floss my teeth like they are supposed to.. just handed me a bag with a toothbrush and floss, and sent me to the front. The receptionist also wasn't very friendly either.. when I asked her to explain the charges again for the \""restoration procedure\"" I had done, and I said what I thought she told me prior to the procedure, she snapped back and said, \""That's NOT what I said.\"" OKay...... how rude! I never received an apology from the hygenist and the receptionist was the icing on the cake.  I will never go back, it's sad because the actual dentist was a really sweet doctor and she was very attentive.  Her staff, on the other hand, really needs an attitude adjustment. If you are having a bad day, that's fine, leave it at the door.  Your patients should not to be treated that way."
1,"I love spicy food.  I'm always picking the menu items with the little pepper by their name.  But the spice at Naked Fish's was just WAY too much.  My whole mouth hurt.  And the food was really average.  We had taken a cab from the strip on a recommendation for Naked and it was just not worth the effort.  They were very nice, it's open late and the space was cute but we wouldn't go back."
2,"I'm brand-spankin new to Arizona, and one minute in this desert heat had me CRAVING some cold, creamy gelato. I was prepared to look high and low to find some of the good stuff, and was even prepared to drive oh-so-far away to Phoenix from Goodyear, but to my surprise, I came across Ground Control! \n\nI walked into this establishment and was really excited to see a non-chain coffee/food/gelato establishment out here in suburbia. It looked and felt like a shop right out of Portland! I was a little confused about where to order, but was told to take a look at a menu at the counter, order there, and then have a seat. Easy enough. \n\nThey have a MASSIVE menu for a small shop, and I was tempted by many items but decided on a crabcake pretzel sandwich. Yum, right? Unfortunately, it took a full 40 minutes to prepare and be served to me, and I was short on time, which was a bit stressful. The sandwich was pretty yummy, a bit cold (hmmmm), but decent enough. I wanted to try their gelato but didn't have time. ;( I did, however, order a glass of white wine, which they did not have cold, so they offered me another type of wine at the same price that was already chilled. I appreciated that service. \n\nThe biggest thing that I noticed here was the lack of customer service -- this place has TONS of potential and good enough food, but the employees were just sort of sitting around and seemed to be more focused on laughing together and having a good time than serving their customers. I'll definitely be back, mostly because I'm all about supporting the small businesses AND I am dying to try some of that gelato -- and hopefully the service will be stellar this next time around."
1,"Der Weihnachtsmarkt 2011 war der schlechteste. 2010 war es zu voll, diesmal war die Sache zwar deutlich entspannter, aber: fast nur Fressst\u00e4nde! Nahezu keine klassischen Weihnachtsmarktst\u00e4nde mit einem weihnachtlichen Angebot! Das Konzept ist mir schleierhaft. Auch das neue Plakat war eher schlecht: der Sternlesmarkt der Vergangenheit war als Motto zwar auch nicht gl\u00fccklich, hatte aber deutlich mehr Charme. Und warum man den Neuen Markt nicht aufgibt und stattdessen das Ambiente der Marktstrasse und des Kirchenplatzes mehr nutzt, erschliesst sich mir nicht. Nur der Gl\u00fchwein vom Ettli und von den Ratsstuben war wie immer gut!"
1,"Came here because I bought the groupon, otherwise I don't think I would of ever stepped foot here.  Saw the reviews and thought it would be a fun little adventure coming to this part of Henderson, it honestly feels like a whole different world driving down Water St. My friend and I walk in to a totally empty restaurant, I'm assuming this is because it's far or the weekend? We order the Chicken Katsu (as recommended by Nelson Q.) and Honolulu special. Both were just kind of blah. The Katsu had a good breading, but no flavor to it at all and the sauce for it had some odd taste to it.  The Honolulu special had no special taste to it either, so it definitely needed the drenching of sauce that came with it. The service was kind bad too because it took awhile for my friend's water to get refilled and they honestly didn't look that busy because there was only 2 other parties there. The ambiance of the restaurant didn't add to it either considering it probably use to be a Mexican restaurant. As much as I like to support local businesses, this place is a no go for me. Thank God I had a groupon."
0,"Just recently had my car washed here.  I was very disappointed - the car wash was poor, car was water spotted, and still dirty. I went home and tried to wipe down the car to fix water spots, dirt spots etc - I was amazed at how much dirt was still on the car andf what a poor job was done. Worst I have ever seen. Really just a waste of time and money."
2,"I came here to get an oil change. The staff were friendly, in that auto-friendly sort of way. When writing up the order for my oil change I was not completely apprised of what they would be doing. Instead of the regular synthetic oil they automatically went with the more expensive \""supreme\"" synthetic oil. Also, while servicing my car they made a mistake with the kind of oil filter to put in it. The order taker had put the wrong kind of vehicle on the work order. I was aware of this only because I was listening to them talk while standing there and watching them work on my car. No one told me anything had happened. Had to wait an additional half hour while they corrected the situation.\n\nAll in all it was okay service at an okay price. Just about what I'd expect from a Sears Auto Center."
3,we love this place Missy often asked to go right there as soon as she lands LOL she a picky eater and can find stuff she loves there....Great food!
0,"I get the theme of the restaurant but the service was horrible. I asked for lemon about 5x and didnt get it till I was done with my food. The food was horrible, dry and had no flavor and it was waaaayyyy over priced. You couldnt pay me to go back."
0,"I went here with my father in law and my 9 year old daughter. I ordered the chilli and it was served in a cup and cost me nearly six dollars, along with it came two packages of two crackers. I started eating the chilli and it was a little spicy so I asked for more crackers, well you would have thought I asked for the goose that laid the golden eggs! I have never come across a more rude Grandma in my life! She made all kinds of remarks and faces because I asked and then brought me two more crackers! She then proceeded to tell a story about a man that used to come in all the time and he was always dieting....she laughed and laughed because even though he dieted he was \""STILL FAT!\"". I couldn't believe what I was witnessing! None of us at the table were fat either so I have no idea where that story came from.\n\nNeedless to say we will NEVER patronize this establishment again, there was nothing special about the food, service or anything else and I along with everyone else in the world can live without the meaness!"
2,"I took my car here as almost a last resort.  My car is pretty old and didn't want to have to put much $$$ into it.  When it started acting up recently I tried taking it somewhere other than the dealership, but they were unable to completely diagnose the problem and said Zimbrick was my best bet.\n\nThe service staff was friendly and did a really good job with my car.  Yes, their labor costs were high but I felt confident that they knew more about my Hyundai and would fix the right thing.  They actually also were able to fix another problem that I hadn't even known about.  The second repair was completely free because it was covered under a recall -- the parts alone for that repair would have added $500 extra dollars.\n\nWhen repairs took an extra day they gave me a loaner for free (which they drove to where I work) and knocked 10% off my bill.  Considering my car was obviously a beater, they treated me with respect and courtesy -- I've been to places where the level of respect is equal to the expensiveness of your vehicle."
0,Saw this on food network and decided to try it.  The cashier was extremely rude and condescending - and the wait for the order was really long.  The food was ok- but after experiencing such a negative and unhappy person at the register - the whole experience was already ruined. The place was also not very clean. Will never go back.
1,"So many reviews to write while on vacay. In Las Vegas on the Strip. There are several convenience stores on the Strip, but it seems like the Walgreens and CVS offer a better selection.\n\nThis CVS is near the Monte Carlo, MGM Grand and NY NY. Good thing about it is that it is open 24 hours. They do have a decent amount of tourist souvenirs, grocery, liquor, electronics and drug store items. Though it is pretty pricey. Jacked up because of the location.\n\nI did find some batteries here as my camera ran out of power. $4 for 4 store brand batteries seems high, but some others were asking for $5+ or $6+. If you need to pick up something for the trip, they have a nice aisle of sample/travel size items. Though no sunscreen. Either remember to bring some, go off the strip to buy some or try the Walgreens across the street. Found some store brand sunscreen which was fine.\n\nNot much to say about CVS other than it is convenient and open 24/7."
4,"Great hotel, great staff and we had an awesome dealer at the Roulette table (his name is Dennis). Beds are so comfortable and the remote drapes are so dark that we lost track of time sleeping. We had such a great stay that we extended our vacation another day. I would definately stay here again."
1,"A nice place but a major rip off.\n\nI was shipping some large boxes. Here is the trick this store played and I presume major UPS Stores play.\n\nIf the LxWxH of the box is greater than 5184, then the billable weight is computed by the formula shown at this link.\n\nhttp://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/ship/packaging/dim_weight.html?WT.mc_id=VAN701060\n\nThe trick is to make sloppy measurements on the upside and charge extra.\n\nAlso, I had one a letter to mail and the lady charged me $3.95 to mail it. Yes, it was less than 2oz and it was a small envelope. That extra money I paid was just for convinece. \n\nIt's a UPS store. These stores have no standards for prices. They charge whatever they feel like."
0,"Delivery time was quick. Unfortunately, I ordered the carne asada fries and the fries were almost raw. It was so disgusting. The chicken quesadilla was OK. The guacamole was lacking flavor. I will never order from them again."
0,My husband and I love their honey hot chicken wings BUT everytime we come here the service is always bad. You have people working at the front with no personality or whatsoever.  Then the girl that takes you to your seat on her butt can hear.  She need to speak up and they need someone at the front who is cheerful and happy to work there.  Then the waitresses are so slow you have to keep looking for them. Ughh so frustrating and it really ruins your night.  I will never go back to this location.
3,Great service and great food.  The Owner really wants to make sure your happy worth your meal. My husband said the waitresses are hot!!  Lol!!  Great little Cafe for breakfast or lunch!!
1,"I was really looking forward to trying out the Vig, now that it had taken over a much-needed restaurant/bar spot that serves the area where I work. I'm sorry to say that while I'm sure it would be a great place to relax on the patio with a cocktail, I was vastly disappointed with the food. I came with a large group for a simple birthday lunch. We were crowded together at a too-small table, despite having made a reservation. The service was unbelievably slow. The vegetarian options on the menu were limited. However, when I asked them to make my dish with tofu instead (which you would think screams vegetarian preference), it still came out with shrimp and an egg. We had waited so long for the food that I let it go and simply shared the shrimp and suffered the egg, but I definitely wouldn't come here for food in the future."
0,Nothings changed. no Boarshead. 2nd rate products. A meat counter that lies about their products.  Kiddies are still in charge. Bring back Bill. I'll stick to Fry's Superstore.
4,So good!  Wish we had started eating here earlier.  Great service and orders are ready super quick.  Very clean inside.
4,great service
2,"I saw this restaurant on my favorite Food Network show, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives (Hosted by Guy Fieri). You know, \""Tripple D\"".  I was in Charlotte for the weekend so I thought why not try out a restaurant from that show. \n\nI came there on a Sunday morning. The line was out the door like any busy, famous, and neighborhood-friendly restaurant for brunch. (TIP: Always go where the locals go.) We waited for 15 minutes and were seated quickly.  The waitress and staff were sweet...like how they should be in the south. We ordered jalapeno bombers for appetizers. It was good...like Church's Chicken good! I had the greek sampler... moussaka (greek lasagna), Spanakopita (spinach pie) and graped leaves stuffed with rice and feta cheese. Oh, I had a side of green beans and corn but too full to touch it. My favorite was the moussaka because I'm not a big fan of feta cheese that was in the spanakopita and grape leaves. It was good and I finished it. I ate what was suggested on Tripple D so I left there happy and full.  Oh, don't forget to check out the desserts in the glass window by the door."
1,"So here is the real deal from someone who has stayed here many times, back when it was known as Imperial Palace to now The Quad.  \n\nI will not go into too much detail about what it was like when it was Imperial Palace because they did remodel some things so I am sure the majority of Yelp readers could care less about what the hotel used to look like.\n\nThe casino itself is not that bad.  Yes, it looks somewhat outdated.  They are working on trying to make it more modern with the whole reinvention thing to The Quad.  Check out line is longer than what I am normally used to but it is bearable.  You will probably spend a max of about 45 minutes waiting in line and that is on the busiest day and you are trying to check in mid afternoon on a Friday or Saturday.  The casino is not the most aesthetically pleasing, meaning that there is absolutely nothing there that makes them stand out.  The only thing that it has going for it is that Hash House a Go Go is inside, but that is the ONLY thing.  They do have an Asian restaurant in there, I say Asian because there is no specific type of Asian food they serve.  They have Pho and Sushi, it is overpriced and not good.  Oh and buy ins for tables are on the lower side, so gambling is not too expensive there.  \n\nParking is confusing as s***.  I have gotten lost so many times looking for my damn car because there is two parking structures that somehow connect and you have to take different elevators to get to different ones.  Pay close attention to where you park and how you got there, like take pictures or something, trust me, you do not want to forget where you parked and spend half an hour running around trying to find your damn car.  \n\nRooms, in all honesty, the rooms are not that bad for the price that you pay.  They have the classic and the deluxe for standard guest rooms.  I am assuming all the people who are complaining about how the rooms are horrible and complete hell holes stayed in the classic rooms.  I am not going to argue with how horrible and crappy those rooms are.  They are the old, unremodeled, standard Imperial Palace rooms and I swear to you, if you pay more than $40 for that room on a normal non holiday weekend, believe me when I say you overpaid for the room.  Those rooms are old, so outdated and hardly anything works correctly.  However, all the times I have stayed there, they have been clean and no bugs or anything like that.  \n\nThe deluxe rooms are a little bit better, slightly pricier, but slightly more modern and bigger.  Some things work correctly and some of the rooms come with a balcony.  That was the one good thing about The Quad, some rooms have balconies.  They are clean but yes for some odd reason all the rooms have an odd smell, not bad, but it smells old.  Room service is so slow, so just a warning on that.  If you want extra towels and stuff, you might have to call multiple times for it because they have a tendency to forget.  \n\nIf you want to do a quick and cheapie Vegas trip, then the The Quad is the way to go.  The location is awesome, right in the middle of the strip.  If you plan on just being in the room to sleep, get ready and shower then The Quad is not that bad."
0,"This has got to be the worst Walmart in Las Vegas.  It's pure filth:  I went to take a cart from where they're stacked up inside the store, not in the entryway like at other branches.  They weren't exactly stacked up; the store wasn't all that crowded, and there were only a few carts available.  And they sat on a floor so covered in black grime, it looked as if it hadn't been washed since the place opened.  Of course, there were none of those disinfectant wipes availabe to hose down the cart - or me.\n\nI had a list of about six things that I needed, and true to form, they were out of three of them.  These were not exotic items, just stuff like Wite-Out, suntan lotion, but I batted only .500.  And that suntan lotion was their own Equate brand, which had been rated the best in Consumer Reports.  Unbelievable!\n\nI had misgivings about going to this Walmart in the first place;  it's always disgusting,  and I did only because I was going to Ulta on Lake Mead and Rainbow.  I won't make that mistake again.  This branch should be condemned by the Board of Health."
3,"We happened upon L'evidence from a referral from the pizza/Italian place down the block (he wasn't open yet, so he sent us here). We were walking in one of the worst snow storms Montreal has seen since 1971. (12/27/12). We had a really great lunch/brunch. My kids were thrilled with the steamed hot chocolate. I had a crepe wth spinich, goat cheese and brie. My husband ordered the eggs benedict and was very happy with the size and taste of his meal. We had really great service (we were one of the few parties in the restaurant due to the weather). We were visiting from Detroit and found our experience to be very \""Montreal\"". We had a great meal with a very warm and inviting environment."
3,"I really like this place,  just wish it was closer!\n\nWhile very similar to a Giant Eagle Market District or Whole Foods, The Fresh Market is something fresh and unique. Yes it's expensive but, so is Giant Eagle Market District and Whole Foods. While it competes with both Market District and Whole Foods you won't find everything you're looking for all the time as it is somewhat smaller then it's two main competitors. \n\nOthers have complained about parking which I don't get. If you want to talk about crappy parking then look no further than the Trader Joe's,  Whole Foods or Giant Eagle Market District parking lots in East Liberty. Now those are parking nightmares!\n\n The meat department has just about anything you could ever want or need. There is also a great selection of organic products. There's even a prepared food section with different flavors of wings, salads, sandwiches just to name a few. The other star of the show is the bakery. Lots of different breads, cakes, pies, cookies and so much more.\n\nSome of the prices were cheaper here than at Whole Foods or the Market District and some weren't. I would say get your everyday items at ALDI, Bottom Dollar or Shop n' Save and get your specialty items here if you can't find them cheaper at Giant Eagle Market District or Whole Foods. Defiantly worth stopping if you're ever in the area.\n\nAll the employees I came in contact with were extremely pleasant and helpful. I just need a closer location and I would be a happy camper."
0,"First I set downstairs. Struck up a conversation with another single woman. We both set at the bar wanting white wine. The bartender knew nothing about wine or what was stocked. The hostess later provided a cheap looking but creative wine list on strips of paper. They stock a number of reds and whites but none I nor the other woman was familiar with. I prefer Chablis but they don't stock any. So I decided to try the house margarita. Listen closely.... Avoid it! It doesn't taste anything like a margarita, they serve it in their regular cocktail glass and they limit you to two of them. I could not suck it down and I can usually drink just about anything that's a cocktail that I set my mind to with a few exceptions. Mark this as a new exception. \n\nFurther more the young bartender did not know what he had on hand. I ordered a Canadian Whiskey and 7 up. He poured and tried to get me to drink a Chivas Regal & 7! The Canadian Club and Seagram Seven was in plain sight! \n\nOur party decided to move upstairs and it took the bar 25 minutes to combine 3 tabs to be paid on one credit card! \n\nUpstairs the waiter decides to card me! Come on I'm old enough to be your mother! He backs down. But when the other female in our party of now four orders a round of shoots for us it takes more than 30 minutes to get them. Because our waiter felt she was tipsy, I'm told when I track him down. \n\nWe looked at the menu but nothing was appealing, not even the font choice of the menu! Worst menu I have ever seen in a new establishment. If not the worst ever. Everything is overpriced. Happy hour consist of half off drinks and $1 off small plates! One dollar! Why bother? \n\nThe host/hostess furthermore kept people waiting at the door at 5pm when there was a number of tables in sight, as well as the majority of the bar. None of us understood that. The restrooms are located on the main floor only and the women's room is a major track to the entry should you need to go, so beware if you are upstairs! The upstairs is not accessible to anyone who can not climb a flight of steep stairs by the way. Many say they like the building but I personally find nothing about it appreciative. They proudly boast that it was built from the ground up for this purpose & use. Being an ex- architect student, take my opinion for free... it's a crappy design! The excessive outdoor seating is nice for a few months out of the year but soon 3/4 of their seating will be avoided due to the AZ heat or seasonal rainstorms. Also the color scheme of gray on gray isn't very inviting. \n\nI chuck this up to been there, done that. I will not be returning. After all why?  Menu sucks, drinks sucks, service sucks, seating sucks."
0,"If I could give them 0 stars I would! Horrible system, waited 45 minutes to pick up mail cause they only had one person and one line going at a time! I got here right when they opened and there was already a line waiting and the workers didn't seem to be in any kind of hurry!!! The most ridiculous thing ever!!!!"
0,I called  as a first patient new to the area and first time pregnant after going through fertility treatments. I gave all my information to the receptionist especially telling her I wanted to schedule an appt. with a MD not a NP only being 5 weeks and fertility Dr. recommending I only see a MD. towards the end the receptionist stated I was all set and I asked her who I would be seeing she said a NP. I stated no I want to see a MD I explained why and she said for the first time you could only see a NP and you will be seeing different MD every time you have an appointment. So I guess its not a organized business? I again explained why I needed to see a MD it was important and she keep repeating no for the first time you have to see a NP. So I said I am requesting to see a MD and your telling me no and she said yes so I told her I couldn't believe what I was hearing and will let people know especially women that have been going through fertility treatment if the customer service is like this I don't want to know what its like with the service.
3,"Cool new spot in the sorta \""mid-downtown\"" area. Think of it as like a poor man's \""Library @ Marquee.\"" I don't mean that in a bad way. It's definitely a great option if you're looking for a chill spot to have a drink.\n\nTonight, they were playing what my friend described as \""minimal techno\"" music. It definitely set up a chill and unique vibe. I like the comfortable chairs.\n\nThey don't have a signature cocktail drink list set up yet, but the bartender told me they are working on one. For now, I ordered an Old Fashioned and it was pretty damn good.\n\nI'll definitely keep this place in mind for a return visit."
4,"Matt Muralt came through for me in a huge way!  My fiancee is a much more dangerous driver now because she keeps on checking on her ring while driving, but likelihood of accidents increasing aside, he made a perfect, intricate, beautiful custom ring and I hope to bring him tons more business over the years.  The whole process was great, and Matt is a wonderful person to work with as well, getting us involved as much as possible in the process, making molds and getting as much input from us as possible."
4,"My husband and I have bought rings and a necklace here.  This is hands down the nicest jewelry store in the area. You won't get low-quality, cheap, overpriced diamonds here like at some other overly hyped jewelry stores in town. The best feature of this store is their no-questions-asked lifetime warranty. Lose a diamond? Bam, new one for free. Need your white gold jewelry re-rhodiumed? Bam, done in a week for free. Need your jewelry cleaned, bam, done in 5 minutes, for free. Need your ring re-sized because you broke your finger? They'll advise you to wait for 3 months because that's how long it takes your finger to fully heal, and then they'll resize it for free. They don't have sales because they don't need to have sales. You are paying for quality. They also offer payment plans where you get 6 months or a year (I can't remember the duration), free interest. Pay it off in the time allotted and you won't pay interest charges. They're a local business too and we all know how important it is to support local business!"
4,"Awesome Gym! Cardio machines on every corner, and a running track upstairs! I am not a fan of running outside when its 115 F so having a place to run inside is an instant winner. If i get tired of running in circles there are 2 pools downstairs! One is a lap pool and the other a wading pool. This room also comes equipped with a hot tub, a steam room, and a sauna! I have not had a chance to take any of the classes yet but the selection looks motivating! Cycle classes and core classes are on my hit list.....I can keep going on about LVAC but ill end it on these notes....Big, Clean, Juice Bar, Pools, RUNNING TRACK! Make a right off lake mead onto rainbow and your right on it."
4,"My wife and I are GR fans. Excellent food and service from Matthew! Snobby host. Pricey, cause you pay for the name and location, but worth it for my wife's bday and just to try one of GR places. Like Yelpers say the music is a bit loud but no biggy. We had chorizo stuffed Maine Lobster app, asparagus and mushroom, medium filet, I had med. rare bone-in NY, nice assortment of breads. We really wanted dessert but were too full. All of the food was excellent - great flavor, cook on meat, seasoning!\nI asked about Christina. Matthew said she was on vacation visiting friends and family in New York. He said when she is there she works the line. Not sure we would go back since there are so many fine dining to try and we rarely get to do it, but I'd definitely recommend."
0,They put the grr in gross.. I would give 0 stars if possible. Enter at your own risk!
4,(this is for Jonny the Barber)\n5 star clean up on my neck. I would give 6 stars if it was available because he offered to do it for just a tip.  where else can you find that???  And it was the first time I was ever offered a cold beer whilst getting a haircut - this place is a gem.  Thanks Jonny!
2,"This was our second stop for the night at one of my friends going away party.  There was a $2 cover since there was a band playing that night.  I'm sure the band was good...I can't really remember.  But what I did remember is the drinks being a little on the weak side.  Now, I understand that I am a professional drinker, so drinks naturally seem weak to me, but my friends said the same thing and they are light weights.  \nThe staff was very polite, so there are no complaints about the service.  It was pretty packed, but not rowdy.  I'll probably give it another try."
4,"Definitely a place to visit! The interior is small and cozy. The desserts are amazing! I had a variety of desserts ranging from French macaroons to scones. Every time I go, I always get the French macaroons and the ham and cheese croissant. The ham and cheese croissant is delicious. It's flaky and the buttery taste just melts in your mouth. You can never have enough of them. The macaroons usually come in three flavors daily, and they change the flavors sometimes. But no matter what flavor, it's always an enjoyment to have. Other bakeries can be overly sweet, but Sugar Bee's is right on the mark. It's not too sweet that you'll stop eating after a few bites. Today's service was so good that it made me want to post my review. I got free samples of scones and an extra macaroon (though I didn't notice till I got home). Thank you!"
3,"This was my first trip to Verde and I  normally do not write a review unless I have experienced a restaurant at least twice, but I wanted to chime in here to counter some of the negative reviews as well as to provide some perspective here.  Full disclosure, I worked in Tucson AZ for almost two years and have traveled extensively through Mexico.  So, with that...\n\nI think the food is very good Mexican food for anywhere, nearly stunning by Pittsburgh standards.    I was there with a group and we did an entire group tasting menu, complete with the house margaritas which where tasty and not too potent for a Sunday night.   \n\nThe tomatillo salsa was good, with nice spicing and depth of flavor. I could have used a bit more heat but in all very well done.  We ordered some guacamole that was good, not great.  I generally like a bit more heat and flavor but clearly it was better than most I have had locally.\n\nThe vegetarian empanadas were a favorite of the table, light and tasty with a great pepito sauce that gave them the right zing.   The crust was light and fluffy, reminiscent of puff pastry dough.\n\nThe seviche special was swordfish and I expected tough and fishy, and got just the opposite.  Light and tasty with a great citrus and spice flavor that worked well with the simply prepared but yummy fried plantains.   \n\nThe pulled port tamale was quite good, probably the best I have had in the Pittsburgh area.  I would generously compare it to those I have had in TX and AZ, with great texture and flavor throughout with just enough kick for balance.  \n\nWe moved to the smoked chicken enchiladas which were very tasty, and while they were a bit heavily sauced, still quite authentic and well balanced.   I would give them a good not great if not for the really awesome smokey flavor of the chicken, that really made the dish.  \n\nThe carne asada was good, again not great but a great option for the \""less than adventurous\"" in the group.  Note that it was very well prepared, we ordered medium rare and it was perfect.  \n\nLast but certainly not least were the fish tacos, specifically mahi mahi.  They were a joy and definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  The mahi was well spiced and full of flavor.  Served in classic San Diego style with cabbage and sauce, I found them to be a favorite of the meal.\n\nIn all, the place is well done and I recommend it as both a place for a nice meal with friends as well as a dinner with the family.  I thought that the only drawback was the ambiance, as it was a bit too trendy and open which could work against it during a crowded night.  It was quiet the night we were there but I could see on a busy night it could be a bit on the loud side.   \n\nI highly recommend Verde!"
3,"Fausto's is a great place that serves up quality Mexican food. You can try to phone them up for a take out order, but your order is unlikely to be understood on the other end of the line, and when you show up to grab your goods you might have a little surprise waiting for you. Just being honest.\n\nFausto's is NOT a sit down type of Mexican restaurant. It's more of a taqueria. I suggest the flautas and the carne asada, personally."
4,"Very good! We were not super hungry so our fabulous server Stephanie suggested we share the Carpaccio. GREAT Recommendation! Wine was perfectly paired, and she made sure we were all paid and out the door in time for our show. Highly recommended."
1,I seldom go to this particular Jamba Juice but if I'm in the area I will stop at this location. The only complaint I really have is that there are not enough employees. I waited about 10-15 minutes for one drink. I felt bad for the guy making my drink because it was so busy but at the same time they shouldn't stay open if the service is not up to par. Do ya self a favor and drive down the street a couple of miles to Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9. Sorry Jamba juice I've moved on!! to bigger and tastier smoothies!!
0,"I have to say the night we went here was one of the worst nights ever! the service was slow the server should have written down our order because she messed it up and my friend i was with had to send her order back 3 times b4 the mgr came out and still didnt get the burger right... we ended up sittitng there for 3 hours and they didnt offer to take the bill then said ok we will give you free dessert... but when the bill came the dessert was on there... again had to talk to the mgr and he said \""sorry\"" once again took off the dessert but still had issues with the bill... you would think at this time they would just comp the whole meal after all the run around we had to go through, but nope they didnt.  I was disapointed at this experience and will be along time before i go back,"
2,"I sit here writing this review trying to remember my time here.  I was at Sammy's for a bachelor party and by this time, I was pretty gone.  I do remember having a pretty potent margarita and somebody ordered some nachos.  Having consumed distilled beverages for about 12 hours at this point, I can honestly say that if they put out stale chips and week old movie-cheese, I would have downed it all in a heartbeat.  The place was lit up like a Christmas tree and people seemed to be having a good time.  You should check it out, cause in Vegas, never know what is going to happen."
0,"If AHS assigns this plumber, I suggest you call the 800 number and request a different contractor.  When scheduling I asked if the R/O repair is a covered plumbing item and they would not comment but said that if it wasn't covered they could still perform the work.  The guy came out looked at it and said not covered and will cost $600 - 800 to replace.  I had another plumbing issue that he wouldn't even look at...just wanted his $75 service call, for no service whatsoever and left.  Later, I found that my RO system can be repaired (tank replaced) for $140.  Lousy service from this company from the first phone call."
4,"Finally made it to this restaurant and it soooo good!  And cheap!  Try the steamed chicken with mushrooms, chinese sausage, and broccoli.  Extremely tasty.  \n\nWe also tried the baby bok choy, chicken curry roti, steamed chicken, beef curry, and salt and pepper wings.  All that for $26!  We couldn't eat all the food and have leftovers for dinner tomorrow.  You really can't beat it.  I could probably eat three plates of the chicken curry roti, if left to my own devices.\n\nNo alcohol, but some folks in the back were doing BYOB."
3,Excellent breakfast with a great view of the pools but the bloody Mary's are a little on the skimpy side.
3,"I have been a regular at Shootz for the past year, when I was introduced to karaoke there on Thursday nights.  The great thing about this place is that it offers enough good features for multiple types of people.  \n\nFor the sports lovers, the large screen above the bar and multiple television sets are often playing the latest games.  Speaking of games, there is also a poker night.\n\nIf you like playing pool, there is an entire room of tables which offer the benefit of table side waitresses ready to bring you beer, mixed drinks, or yummy food.\n\nIf you are hungry, the kitchen is open until late (closing) with a full menu of hamburgers - though my favorite is the chicken wrap.  \n\nOf course, I go there for the karaoke. There is a stage, which serves both karaoke on Thursdays and open mic on Tuesdays.  The quality of the karaoke has a lot to do with the kj (rotates from a local karaoke jockey group) and the singers of course. There are about ten regulars and everyone is very friendly.\n\nThe only cons to the place - sometimes it gets inundated with large groups who take over the karaoke and turn it into a drunken frat joke.\n\nOther then that - I can't complain. . .it's where I met my fiance!"
2,"The restaurant is clean, and service was friendly. The beef terriyaki is tasty. I've had better Hawaiian BBQ chicken elsewhere. The protein portion was small. Considering there is not much variety of eats in Buckeye, this place is a good alternative to the fast food joints."
0,"Well, I had been warned by many people not to come here, as it seems the yelp reviews match what I've been told. So I go on a saturday night for a \""night out\"". \n\nIn what world is this an irish bar? Tip: turn it into a mexican party bar and you'll do much better. However I fear the the health of the patrons here. But I'll get to that in a minute.\n\n1) wait wait, $5 cover here while no cover at saddle ranch -which has way better service? HA! \n\n2) service was absolutely horrendous. Yes, the bar was crowded on a saturday night, but I'm not a noob to the club scene. It shouldn't take standing at the bar for 10 minutes to get a drink when you're not 3 people deep. I've never seen so many workers behind a bar with such slow service. Everyone looking like they're working but nothing really getting done. Too many bar backs?\n\n3) Here's the most troubling. I saw at least one bar tender scooping ice with a glass. Um, are you retarded? How do you have a job as a bar tender? This is one of the biggest no nos as a bar tender. Hope you like glass shards in your drinks! \n\nDefinitely won't be back.\n\nOh and it looks like many of the TGIF restaurants in the valley are turning into Mcfaddens. Not that I went to TGIF in the first place, but definitely won't anyway."
2,"Good food overall!! Offers a wide variety of dishes to pick from, and all the vegetarian' curries taste good. I would rate it a zillion times better than the lame 'Basmati' that it used to be earlier. However, i wouldnt recommend any dish that involves meat (chicken/lamb). I auways end up finishing the whole dish, leaving all the meat aside. It feels like huge, bland chunks of cisco meat that taste no better than rubber had been dumped into the gravy/sauce/curry that you ordered for, and then served. Now i stick to vegetarian food when ever i visit this place.\n\nNote: good cust service."
0,Was satisfied with the work done on my car until I found out that this place put FIVE YEAR OLD tires on my car.  Disgusted!!! They lasted three months.  Don't waste your time.
1,"Whoa! That's the one word that came out of my mouth exactly 3 times when I walked into this place. I came here because I was in the area and it came up on yelp in the dive bar category. Also, being of German heritage myself, I thought it might be a sort of mini hofbrau haus. Yeah, I was mistaken. Don't get me wrong, this is an interesting place with lots of character. Really though, this place has much more of a VFW or local legion or senior citizen center feel to it. I'd take my grandparents here. Hell, I'd even take my parents here. Take it from me though, you really wouldn't want to bring a date here."
0,"I came back today to pick up my glasses at my SCHEDULED appointment time..when I arrived the gentleman told me that the glasses would not be there until the afternoon and never are so he's not sure why he told me to come in earlier in the day! (Even though he scheduled my appointment). He then proceeded to say \""would you like me to drop everything here and go to the lab myself to get them right now, seeing as how you think you are at priority\"" I was shocked at his rude, sarcastic remark and asked if he was honestly talking to a paying customer that way. He simply said the glasses will be here at 1:00pm. If you are considering coming here, TURN AWAY NOW!! Very rude, very unprofessional, unorganized and have terrible customer service skills."
3,"Close to the house. Decent pricing. Efficient service - Its a winner in my book. On top of that, it's attached to a very well priced Chevron gas station with a little convenience store. My favourite feature of Classic Car Wash is that they don't try to oversell you with detailing services and such -  I hate when they do that but apparently they have learned not to."
4,"love love loved our experience here!! 6 girls for a birthday party, brought in champagne & our nails turned out fabulous!"
4,"Fourth time here and trying happy hour. Fountain drink and appetizer free from 5pm to 8pm. I got the chips and sides: refried beans, red salsa, and guacamole. Salsa and beans remind me of old El Paso, but guacamole is really good. Service and hookah is top notch like always."
4,Redemption
1,"All right...  So I go to an \""Irish\"" bar/pub for one reason and one reason only.  To have irish whiskey.  So when I went to Murphy's Law I expected to have some irish whiskey, it is an Irish pub after all.  So when I ask what types of irish they have I get the answer \""Bushmills and Jameson\""  Just regular old Bushmills and Jameson.  Not even the top shelves of each brand, just the boring old shopping at Walgreens brands of irish whiskey.  \n\nSo I have a new \""Irish\"" bar that I hang out at.  It has a way better and deeper selection of Irish whiskey.  It's called Fry's Grocery store.  I'll be getting my Irish on in the frozen food section."
1,"I wanted to love you Spicy Pickle, but it was your pickle I liked best. I had the Bandito panini with Peppered turkey, pepperjack, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, chipotle mayo. I took the sandwich to go and by the time I got to eat, it was pretty soggy. The blend of flavors didn't save it. I'll have to give it a second chance and dine in, maybe try a specialty sandwich instead."
0,"Horrible, I asked if a could add a large drink and the man at the drive through said \"" Add it on at the 2nd window\"", in a rude way. Then we had to wait 14 minutes just for two four piece chicken nuggets we ordered since they only rang up one. So we pulled off and  they didn't give us any sauces, so we went back and got them. When we opened it up and they had given us the habanero ranch. Strange the woman in jeans and a black shirt \""no uniform?\"" missed it. Needless to say the 5 and 9 y/o that they were for couldn't eat that. You would expect better on this side of town. Tip: \""Don't waste your time and money here!\"" Ps, don't miss the current 93 sanitation rating from this February!"
4,"BYOW & Beer was amazing. They give you a ice jug for your alcohol too. Awesome food, big portions. A little expensive- but then again you aren't spending a bunch of money on booze. Would definitely go again."
0,Horrible service. Drinks took way too long(they weren't busy) . Our server would only ask what one person in our small party (7) needed. And didn't pay attention to the females in the group. Won't be back
1,"Pilier de mon alimentation lorsque j'\u00e9tait \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9, Reuben's deli a drastiquement chang\u00e9.

1,"Bad service, pasta under cooked, and a health score of 92!"
0,"If I could give less than one star I could.  The only thing missing from this place is a whites only sign.  If you're not 20, skinny and white don't even bother.  As nice as the Bellagio is this club isn't high end.  There were girls walking around the club with flip flops on.  But they were white so they got treated better than our party.  This experience has me not even wanting anything to do with the Bellagio as a whole.  Stay away if you don't enjoy being discriminated against."
2,"The club itself is beautiful. Different rooms and bar areas to lounge in. Thank god for a hip hop room... I don't know why it's so hard to find hip hop in vegas. Even with Marcus Schulz spinning in the main room, as reputable as he is, I just can't get my party on to trance. wompwompwomp unce unce unce... NOOOO! I want to groove and grind, not jump!  Anyway, beautiful atmosphere and view on top of the cosmo. \n\nThe BAD- SERIOUSLY?! ALL THOSE STAIRS!!?!?!?!?! How can you expect me to get all dolled up and climb up all those stairs AND when I drink how am I supposed to make my way back down??! I don't understand!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do people get carried out of this place or what? \n\nI really would love to party here more whenever I'm in town but it's just not practical for me. The event hosts/promoters/bouncers are really sweet and helpful, not douchey like other places so I really wanted to make this a regular spot. I just don't want to worry about how I'm going to get out of there or how much my feet are hurting before I even start getting my party on."
2,"While I am giving Ruth's Chris a rating of A-OK, I would not recommend it to the average Las Vegas vacationer. There are so many restaurants in Las Vegas, I would say just go somewhere else. We came to Ruth's Chris specifically because we usually have a good experience at Ruth's Chris, and wanted something tried and true. My husband even surprised me with a giftcard to use for the occasion. The server was very nice and attentive. However, the restaurant was off the strip,  which we knew ahead of time, but we were not crazy about it when we got there. It was in some weird strip mall. The food just didn't wow me either. I asked for medium well. The outside of the steak was very charred and the inside was barely medium at parts. No problem with the service, but the food itself just wasn't that impressive, especially for what you're paying."
2,"Good food but so expensive comparing \nFor the food they serve, the service is great the margaritas need to be better although they said it was made from scratch but didn't buy that"
3,Its sophisticated and trendy. The kind of venue I'm always looking for to host film industry events.
1,Wow!  This place was kind of embarrassing.  It was so bad and not a happening place.  I happened to go there because two coworkers wanted to go in.  I can't believe people would pay to get in here.  We did not.  \n\nThe only good thing is that they serve American Honey shots at a good price.  \n\nIf you like to see a crowd that goes from 21-99 years old then this place is kind of cool.   For you!!  Not me.  \n\nI am not super into 60-70 year olds getting all freaky.  Kind of a joke.  Might be cool for some though.  \n\nHave fun.
3,"A friend went to Vegas and took some pictures at this store so I needed to drag the family here when on vacation! I was a very happy camper, with all of the different Hershey's candies, the bakery, and chocolate Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty around me. My family actually bought a few candies, after not being up to going here in the first place.\n\nThe store is big, unlike M&M World. Even though it was crowded, people weren't in our faces or close to us. We didn't feel rushed and I took my time browsing.\n\nThe highlight of our time here was seeing a Hershey's kiss character walk out of the back and wave to us before going outside in the cold. It was kinda cute!"
2,I'm sad to find out that tlaquepaque is no longer in business. This was one of the places that we visited when we did not live here permanently. The owner was really nice and she was always ready to help.. I remember her because her name was Anna also.. I would like to know why did she close.? It seam like the store was busy.
1,"I really wanted to like this place.  Since I moved to Phoenix I have been looking for a nearby local bike shop.  Bike Barn is right around the corner from my office.  It seems like the tendency is for anybody that deals in specialized goods is to become really cliquish.  As you can see from looking at the reviews under \""bicycle shop\"" it is definitely something that goes on a lot with bicycles.  When I  first started looking for a shop I took some time off and went to 5 in a row.  I would go into the shop and look at their stuff.  No one said anything to me in the first 4 shops.  That seems to be typical of bike shops in Phoenix.  If you aren't in the club they don't have time for you.  I suppose it doesn't help that I am not young, pretty and particularly fit, but when I was all three I raced bikes, worked in a bike shop, and lived the life for years so apparently I have unrealistic ideas about what service can/should be.\n\nUnfortunately Bike Barn is a typical Phoenix shop.  I have gone twice.  The first time I talked to a semi-informed unfriendly mechanic .  The second time I sought help in getting the right fit on my bike (with an appointment paying for the time, mind) and it was clear that the person had better things to do.  Don't know what, the store was empty.\n\nSo...if you are part of the club, or the staff is having a good day...good for you.  I won't be back."
0,"If you want the epitome of the Scottsdale/LA wannabe scene this is where you go.  This place is corporate as it gets down to the Ed Hardy wannabe Saddle Ranch shirts a lot of the servers sport... UHHHHHH!!!! How is that appealing in any way?  I was waited on by a very tragic girl as well, I believe her name was Rebecca.  She was pushy and rude.  I wanted to just check out the place and see what they had to offer and if I wasn't ordering what she wanted me to order she really didn't pay much attention to us!  i couldn't believe it!  She was telling us about different things on the menu such as steaks and drinks and was quoting things that she needed to do a little more research on. She really didn't know the big differences of some of the steaks how do you reccommend something and don't even know anything about it?"
2,"Taco Guild gets points for atmosphere and style but I'm not impressed with their food. These are \""gourmet\"" tacos with lamb and peking duck(cough), but I didn't find them any good for the price. I prefer La Condesa for this type of fancy tacos.  For real street tacos, stick to holes-in-the-wall or stands/trucks. Given that, the old church setting is actually kind of cool and worth a one-time visit."
2,"This location of Goodwill is not my favorite, but from time to time, you can find a good buy here. I found a couple of pairs of nice name-brand jeans here.  2 negatives for this store: it is crowded and I don't like the fitting rooms."
2,"This place isn't too bad ... it's your standard burger joint with slightly elevated prices for a normal burger spot, but just about right for being on the strip.\n\nHad the Blue Cheese Burger and Fries/Onion Strings Combo .. Beef was cook medium like I ordered and tasted fresh. Fries were ok - standard. Onion strings were good - they're very thin and a good change from normal onion rings but on a normal day i think i would prefer normal sized onion rings.\n\nGF had the veggie burger that she liked very much. Tasted good except the patty wouldn't really stay together and was falling all over the place so it's more of like a veggie mush. \n\nOverall 3 stars just cause it's a decent burger spot, but nothing too special compared to Fuddruckers or any place like that."
0,"My boyfriend, myself and his cousin all got different overpriced  hot dogs with its special toppings at this establishment. That was fine. The ridiculous overpriced soda was ok too. I mean, it's Vegas and the place was located in the bustling new LINQ wanna be promenade thing. That's all gravy baby. I expected something similar to Dog Haus. But I was wrong. The hot dogs were kind of ridiculous. I guess I had a high expectation cause there were actually a lot of people inside. My fault, because I yelped only right after I ordered and sat down. The hot dogs were ok. Won't cry about it. The NOT so GOOD thing is the shrimp cocktail special.  NOT GOOD AT ALL. My boyfriend and I had a freaking stomach ache after eating it. His cousin was fine, because he didn't order one. But my bf and I were NOT ok. Horrible. And what sucked the most was the fact that we ate here for a quick bite before driving the long stretch back to LA. URGH. Never again. Ever."
4,"This is by far probably the one of my top 3 (most likely second) shows. \n\nI love the use of the water, synchronized swimmers, and acrobatics. \n\nOur seats were in the splash zone, &&I could totally understand how it would be the splash zone, but it wasn't like water ride soaked.\n\nI don't want to give away the storyline or anything, so I'll just leave it as a MUST SEE!"
2,"I was nervous when I reserved a room at Circus Circus. I read so many reviews. I decided to give it a try. I loved it. i stayed in the WEST TOWER on the 21st floor. The room was clean. I had no complaints. I normally take my lysol and spray the entire room, including the bed and bathroom. My 2 boys (14 & 11)loved it and they are usually picky. There were no kids in the hall running around, in fact I didn't hear any kids yelling during my stay so that was great. If you decide to stay here make sure you stay in the WEST TOWER. When I was checking in, I did hear people complain about their rooms, but they were staying in the skyrise tower and casino tower so i guess those rooms are not as great!!!!\nOh and try to check in around 2:30pm., there isn't as many people. It only take about 15 minutes at the most."
3,"This is a chain restaurant, but it doesn't feel like it. It's interior suggests something closer to fine dining, but the prices are actually really reasonable. One of the best things about it is the view it has.\n\n It's pretty basic Italian food, but you'll feel like you are getting more than your money's worth."
3,came for uye. its been a while since ive been here.\n\nhad the english breakfast. im used to a sloppy breakfast. eggs all runny and messy. bacon dripping with fat. sausage dripping with oil. toast caked with butter. this was probably the cleanest looking breakfast plate i had in a while. the only time it got messy was when i started to eat and cut my stuff up. i really liked the pesto spread on my toast.\n\nonly gripe is the pigeons walking around on the ground and flying on top of the tables after people leave. \n\ngreat brunch stories with angela and joe as always. =) those two should write a book.
0,Stanley Security Solutions has very rude customer service both at the counter and on the jobsite.  They made one of my customers that I sent them to very upset. Now I have to do damage control.... I guess this is what we get when big Walls Street companies like Stanley Black and Decker buy out local mom and pop shops.  Their loyalty is to their stock shareholders and not those paying for their customer no-service.  Their company culture definitely filters down to customer.  Shame on you Stanley !
1,"Came in for dinner on a Monday night and the place had a few other people eating, but otherwise empty. We ordered spicy tuna, California and Philly rolls. We felt like it was very average sushi. Also ordered the chicken wings, which did not match the menu description of asian flavored wings, instead came out as normal buffalo wings. Only 5 in the order for $6. Would not come again or recommend."
3,I can't remember very much from when i was here so I can't write a very detailed review however I do remember the room we were in was very big and had a huge table and of course big screen for the karaokeeeee singers and it was FUN.
0,"Okay, I love Starbucks and am a gold card member.. But this location is my absolute least favorite.. Which totally stinks since it's the closest to my house. The drive thru wait is always forever long. They mess up my order more times than they get it right. I was just there, went inside, long line and they were not putting names on orders. This caused a cluster of drinks and confusion at the pickup window. I'm pretty sure I got the wrong drink and it tastes terrible. That or they messed up my order again. I'm making the switch to Grouchy Johns which is just as close. I'll save my Starbucks fix for the location by my work which is always on point."
3,"Great Sushi!  Very fresh but a little pricey.  The place has an excellent ambiance...great for celebrations!  Location at the Epicenter is great, especially if you are planning to go out for drinks afterwards."
4,"I hosted my friend's bridal shower brunch here and had such an amazing experience!  We had a party of 13, and were seated in the best part of the restaurant (the back room by the patio...tons of sunshine and warm on cold day).  We were also out of the way of heavy traffic.\n\nAlthough the restaurant was packed due to Memorial Day weekend, our server was so amazing.  Yes, they forgot to bring syrup with the waffles and extra berries with the crepes, but the food was outstanding and they responded quickly to our needs.\n\nThe breakfast menu was large with many different types of options.  They definitely had something for everyone.  I had the crab cake benedict ($16) and my eggs were perfectly poached.  My friends loved both the savory and sweet crepes and everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered. \n\nI would definitely recommend making reservations.  We finished up around 12 noon and there was a long line on our way out.  We made our reservation 2 months in advance (due to the large party/holiday weekend), and when I tried to make a small change two weeks before, they were unable to accommodate, but we still had a great time!"
0,"Best word to describe this company is HORRIBLE!! I only marked one star because I had to! Every single driver we had between 2 different casinos was rude, not helpful and just plain nasty to all of us! They let you know that the last scheduled pick up is at 12:05am but then they drive right past you and don't even let you know that they are still dropping off at 12:05am as well.  REALLY? Because you can't pick up and drop off at the same time considering the shuttle service is between only two casinos? My next step with this is complaining to each casino about this company . Has no one heard of customer service??"
1,"$47 dollars for 2 people, you would think the food is good. This crap was nasty. The only foods that were decent was the little fried shrimp and the ice cream. What a waste of money and time. Never again and why was it so much dessert, but hardly anything else?"
2,"5 Stars for AMBIANCE, AMBIANCE, AMBIANCE. The exposed sandstone brick decor, with rich wood accents, low light and great background make this a sexy, sophisticated yet reasonably priced upscale place for a date or for an intimate gathering with a few friends. The service is also top notch and they have a nice selection of wine.\n\nI have to deduct two stars for the lack-luster prime rib which was so disappointing after a delicious starter salad. I had to give props for the creamy horseradish which singed my nasal passages and brought a few tears to my eye. The cut of meat was generous in size and cooked a perfect medium rare as I had asked but it was on the tough and dry side and completely lacking in flavor. I very seldom send back meals and since there was nothing wrong with the preparation, I chose to just endure it. \n\nSo sadly my first experience here was a bit of a wash after the less than stellar meal. That being said that atmosphere here is just so amazing I will have no choice but to return, if nothing else for cocktails. But I'm sure there's something on the menu that I'm bound to enjoy. I will just steer clear of the prime rib."
0,"Adding another ONE star review to the existing thirty or so one star reviews for Spirit Airlines.\n\nThey nickel and dime you for everything. The airline charges for:\n-CARRY-on. RIDICULOUS. \n-WATER and peanuts on the plane. RIDICULOUS.\n-To choose your seat. RIDICULOUS. \n\n// FACILITIES //\n\nThe plane was disgusting and filthy with tiny seats. I'm 5'1\"" and petite, and I already felt so cramped. \n\n// SERVICE // Sarcastic and mouthy flight attendants \n\nSave yourself the headache and do not fly Spirit Airlines. EVER."
3,Good wings and fun atmosphere :)  The rest of the menu is what you'd expect from a college/university pub - but I think most people go here for the wings.
2,I only went onto the casino floor here. Overall the casino looks really nice with a good variety of tables wih there nightclub entrance overlooking the casino floor. The one downfall was that they have dancers on a stage in the middle of the tables. I wasnt sure if the were females or males dressed as females...
2,"Some friends and I dined here for Sunday brunch while visiting Las Vegas in March 2014. \n\nFood was wonderful. I had the chicken enchiladas poblanos which was really, quite good. I would order it again in a heartbeat. We also ordered dessert. The Mexican chocolate cream pie was extremely delicious and very, VERY rich. I ordered the smaller portion and still couldn't finish it. My spouse had the flourless chocolate cake and said it was quite good. I had a small bite of his, but between the two, I prefer the Mexican pie. \n\nAtmosphere and service are nothing exceptional. It's a perfectly ordinary restaurant that happens to put out some exceptionally good Mexican food. They do get bonus points for sustainable sourcing of the meats though. That's something that's important to my family and I was glad to see them take that stance.  I can't say that it's a \""can't miss\"" establishment, but if you have the time and are craving Mexican food, this is a great place to try. \n\nI'd recommend brunch, for the added bonus of $10 bottomless mimosas."
0,Went to Spotted Donkey today and sign says they are closed!
3,"Not a bad bar, not a great one either. Always same people I see everytime I go.  Wish they had better drink specials and more choices on food. Probably will return because its close to home."
2,"This place is okay, not fantastic. Especially when there are sooo many A+ places to eat in Vegas. I would maybe eat here again becuase there aren't many nice mexican food places in Vegas. The food was good, but very americanized. I prefer traditional mexican food, and this was not it. I will say the margarona was great. It is a margarita with a corona... It is worth trying!! If your just looking for drinks and appetizers then this place is a good spot."
1,"Not the tastiest food in town, but not the worst. Go for simple meals that are hard to mess up and you should be OK. I'd go to this place for convenience rather than for the taste of the food. Keep your expectations to a minimum. I also find it odd that this is a favorite place amongst some of the tech startups in the tannery."
2,"Was at The Duce last night partying with a group of people from my husbands work (it was a surprise party for the owners birthday). Although my husband and I had a really good time, I think it was mostly because of the entertainment which my husbands company hired (Doors cover band flown out from NY, hello, hella good!). But when rating the actual food, drinks, service, and venue of The Duce, everything was very mediocre I felt. The drinks were ok although made pretty dang strong. The food had its ups and downs. We were pretty much able to try everything from the corn coins, to the maple ribs, to the Noodle Kugel, to a majority of the sliders (Meatball, Brisket, Caprese, and Chicken Sausage) along with 2 salads (I believe one was the Duce salad and the other was the farmers market salad) along with their home made see through greasy potato crisps. The only thing that my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed was the Brisket sliders which were absolutely delicious. Problem was that the Brisket sliders went fast and there was no effort to refill them until close to the end of the party. When we did notice there was more, we grabbed a few and even though they were ice cold, they were still the best thing there. The meatball sliders were ok as well...Aside from those two things, not impressive food wise. For dessert, they were passing around smore cheesecake which was alright I guess but not anything spectacular. Now on to the atmosphere... it was kinda a shmorgusboard (however you spell it) of random stuff in a big warehouse. There were not very many tables although they could have been cleared out for our event, not sure. My husband and I agreed that this place could be really good as a concert venue that sells food and drink as it was a good place to see the show last night. However, it doesn't sound like they have bands there often and The Doors cover band we saw last night was at my husbands companies expense. Finally, the parking seems like it can be a bit stressful if you are not using valet which was complimentary for us last night (not sure if that was on the company or not). I will conclude with this: The Duce was a decent place to host a party and have a band come in and play. They seemed to cater to the party I attended very well although the people hosting are rich so I am not sure if or how much money played a part. Would I go here again on my own though to have a meal or drink? Most definitely not. It is a really far drive from Maricopa and totally not worth it."
3,"I really like this place, it's very cozy if you like intimate settings but if your claustrophobic you maybe want to just get your food to go. The food is amazing the customer service was great the reason for my 4 stars is because it took forever for our food to come but the only reason it took forever was because the food was freshly cooked. When I'm in town again I would love to go back :)"
1,"On our last visit to Vegas, we craved Chinese food and went to their Chinatown hoping to enjoy some authentic Sino cuisine.  We had eaten here before and didn't have any negative thoughts that prevented us from trying it again.\n\nWe entered the restaurant at lunch time and the place was mobbed. They had three waiters running to and fro taking orders and delivering food to tables.  It was extended period of time before they came to our table to give us the menus and finally take our order.  We had to ask for water three times.  It seemed like an endless amount of time before our food arrived.  The wine chicken was dry.  The Kung Pao chicken looked and tasted like it was reheated.  I ordered the lunch special and it was supposed to come with soup.  However, it never came and based upon the quality of food here that was just as well.  The special did not include rice so it we had to pay for it. My wife asked several times for the check (in Chinese) and they took their time bringing it.  By the time we finished, I just wanted to leave this place never to return.\n\nAll-in-all, the Emperors Garden is full of weeds.   As they would say in Chinese, this place is Boo Hao (bad!)"
3,"Very low prices compared to other sushi joints.  The sushi is good, and I enjoy the tea here :)"
0,I brought my little boy here for grooming and he came back bleeding. I called the groomer and they were apathetic about the entire situation. If that not bad enough they called me several months later to see if I wanted to set up another appointment and I expressed my concerns again and once again they did not seem to care.
2,"if your in the mood for cheap greasy Mexican food you found the right place, food is not that bad it is a little too salty don't even try the soup if you cant take a pound of salt. If your craving Mexican it does the trick cant beat the price the chips & salsa are free with any meal and it is the best part I would compare it to filibertos it it were a restaurant that served you only thing is El Palacio has better salsa"
0,I am a Chinese student here and have tried a lot of Chinese Food in AZ area. This one have terrible crappy food with the worst customer services. My roommate and I odered the lunch specical and they sent us the large size food which charged us more than $20 and they rejected to do anything for their mistake. \n\n==PANDA==========
0,"This was our breakfast before we headed back home after our mini vacation in SIn City. After reading good reviews about this place the BF and I decided to give it a try and sadly we were disappointed! \n\nFirst off they didn't open until 10:30, shouldn't dim sum be open at 8?! When they finally opened we got seated right away but service was VERY slow as there was only ONE CHART walking around to serve 12+ tables with families waiting for some dim sum. I don't know why it's so packed but it must be good right? .....WRONG!!! .....When the lady finally came up to us there wasn't a lot of selection to choose from and the usual items that we get back home weren't that good at all. The shu mai was okay I give them that but  the chicken feet was disgusting and everything else didn't taste fresh at all. \n\nTotally would not eat here again!"
0,I came here with a group of friends because I have always heard good things about this place.  Our server was friendly and really attentive which was a plus.\n\nOther than that everyone's food was average and I had a salad with grilled chicken added.  My chicken tasted like tuna.  Enough said.
1,"Bad service, the hotel is VERY old and not well maintained.\nI give the two starts only for the location: kind of cool to be right in front of fremont st."
3,Stopped by asahi bakery to order a cake and found this new location next door. Always consistently good ice cream. Tried the newest flavor - peaches and cream and it was yummy. Glad to see them expanding. 3rd location is in terminal 4 somewhere.
4,People are great and the food is awesome. Been eating their pizza's regularly for a couple years now. Awesome!!
1,"*This review is for the Oakland location only*\n\nEvery couple of years I get the itch for some ink though I have an artist I am really happy with I wanted to expand my horizons a bit so I decided to check out Jesters Court in Oakland (a friend of mine has had some work done by Michael Patrick at the South Side location and his work is really great so I thought okay, I'll check this place out)\n\nI went to have an owl drawn up so I took a necklace in for a bit of reference, the guy photo copied it, gave me his card and told me to call the next day so that is what I did. He said he had some ideas when can I come in, I replied that I worked today but had the next 2 days completely free. He asked if I could do it hat day, I said sure I'll be down at 6 when I take my break. I walked down the hill, made it there by 6:04 only to find a sign that said \""be back in 10\"" I waited 25 and left. \n\nI lost my break and my $20 deposit but that's okay, lesson learned. I will never stray again!"
1,Not terrible but not good. We went here the other night and I got fresco tacos and there was hardly anything but lettuce on it! Better luck next time I guess.
3,"Try to come in the morning or evening. N e other time the place is packed and sometimes it's hard to get in.  If you live in Charlotte and work in this area (Carowinds Blvd. or nearby) make it a part of your stop to get the best deals on gas.  Right down the road once the state lines crosses back over into North Carolina the Shell station (on the corner of S Tryon) is at least $0.20 more.\nAlso, keep in mind that in the summer the place can get packed out b/c of all the visitors coming across the street from Carowinds getting food and snacks at the store and the Wendy's that's right next door."
2,Most expensive headband purchase ever.  I came in here thinking I might find one cheaper than ULTA which is located next door.  \nSpent $65 and didn't find a headband.
1,"I was in Madison for a night and picked this hotel as all the downtown hotels around Capitol Square were booked solid. Madison is small enough that getting downtown is still a pretty quick drive - take Mineral Point to Midvale to University Avenue. \n\nThe room was surprisingly spacious and the appointments were of decent quality for the price (around $60/night), the wifi is free (a lot of expensive hotels charge $15/night for wifi - seriously!?), and the staff is very pleasant and accommodating. However, the following items were disappointing.\n\n- The bed sheets weren't exactly clean. There was plenty of hair from the previous occupant in the bed. Not fun to discover that.\n\n- There was a bar of soap lying in the bathtub with more hair. Gross.\n\n- The pillows were substandard. They were extremely small pillows like one would find on a couch. Not fun for sleeping on and I had a pretty restless night thanks to them.\n\nI'd probably stay here again if the downtown hotels are all booked up but if I have a choice, I'll pay a few more $ and stay downtown."
4,"Awesome cocktails. There are too few good sit-down cocktail places in Madison. This place really fills that niche for me. Food is good too. Definitely not for dinner time - the portions are too small, you will spend a fortune trying to get full. But it is a good accompaniment to drinks. Mussels with chorizo are good (very rich sauce, just fyi). White anchovies are also very good - my favorite."
2,"The food is pretty basic.  This is not a place really made for dining in there's a large table a little space inside and theirs barely any room to have 2 people walk around inside. Service was quick and friendly. They're open and delivery 24hrs a day. So that's cool. They have some good pizza deals. Prices were OK for about $20 I got a large one topping pizza, mozzarella sticks and bread sticks."
2,"I stayed at the Silver Sevens this past weekend with my boyfriend on our weekend getaway to Vegas. It was my first time not staying on the strip, so I was a bit skeptical wondering about price and location, but for $60 bucks a night on a Saturday (plus taxes and the surprise resort fee of $11...about $85total), I felt it was worth it. My biggest element I look for in a hotel is a comfy bed and somewhat modern appeal in the rooms. The Silver Sevens totally had both. I was surprised by how nice the decor and cleanliness of the room was. I felt for the price, that it was worth it because anything on the strip would have been well over $100 for a Sat night. It's not too bad of a walk  to the strip - probably about 15/20 minutes each way or a short cab ride away. It was hard to hail a cab on our walk so be mindful to call one or if you want the exercise the walk is definitely do-able. The Hard Rock Hotel is across the street and there were lots of restaurants around - PF Changs, Lawry's etc. I've seen this hotel listed for $30 a night and would definitely book it again at that cheap price!\n\nCons: \nNo comforters on the bed - I thought it was strange, but the bedding only had 1 blanket and a top sheet over it...maybe it's a summer thing? It got cold with the air on, so ask for another blanket.\n\nTolietries - I would suggest bringing your own shampoo's and soaps. Very tiny soap bars and the seemed stingy with the towels - we only got 1 big towel in our room and had to call for another. \n\nNo iron - my boyfriend needed to iron his shirt and it took 45 minutes for someone to come bring us an iron and board because they were short staffed. They didn't really seem to care at first, but after our 5th call to the front desk they finally did something about it. \n\nAir quality - the air quality in this hotel is poor. It does not have a strong filtration system like the major hotels do. Totally smells like a weird dirty casino a bit, but it's not unbearable. \n\nCoffee Maker - no coffee maker in the room, I guess they give that in the suites...seems funny...so be ware morning coffee drinkers, lol.\n\nNo drinks? - We drove from CA and totally wanted a cold drink, but there was only one tiny bar open and it was filled with people sitting at the bar playing digital poker games...it's definitely not a hotel with \""options\"" as far as multiple lounges, bars, restaurants inside. The Cantina bar was closed. \n\nPros: \nWe enjoyed the Sunday brunch buffet - $10 bucks a person with unlimited champagne was worth it"
2,"Note:  I've actually been to Dillon's Thunderbird as well, but I go here more often so I figured people could review this location separately if they wanted.\n\nFor anyone whos ever been to Kansas City, they know theres a distinctly different feel when you goto a suburban BBQ restaurant versus an urban BBQ joint.  In Kansas City, a perfect example would be KC Masterpiece Grill (a suburban BBQ restaurant) versus Arthur Bryant's (an urban BBQ joint).  In Phoenix, we have a similar equivalent.  Honey Bear's is more of an urban BBQ joint whereas Dillon's fits the suburban BBQ restaurant to a tee.\n\nThe differences between places like Dillon's and Honey Bear's lie mostly in the atmosphere.  Dillon's is a nice easy going sit down restaurant that just happens to serve barbeque whereas Honey Bear's is the type of place where there isn't much room to sit, its sounds like a crowded bar on a busy day, and the aroma grabs you right from the get go.  Each has its charm.  But for this review, let's talk Dillon's food and atmosphere.\n\nMuch like their original location at Thunderbird and the 101, the Dillon's at 59th Ave just north of the 101 serves up a cozy restaurant style atmosphere with a full bar near the front and plenty of seating everywhere else (including the patio).  I've never had trouble getting a table here as this place is pretty tucked away near the Arrowhead golf course communities.  The crowd usually varies depending on the type of day, but most of the time you'll see young families, workers from nearby, and couples nearing retirement.   I've always had friendly service, but I've always been baffled by how slow service is.  Like I said, I've never seen it crowded so one would think you could get in and get a meal pretty quick, but its never worked out that way.  So does the food make up for it?\n\nMostly.  My favorite time to come here is lunch as their lunch menu is basically the same as dinner (only cheaper) and the sandwiches usually hit the spot.  The pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are among my favorites as the portion of meat is usually just right and they throw on the right amount of sauce.  Steak fries or beans usually go pretty well with these.  If ribs are your thing, they've got you covered with baby back or pork spare ribs usually being the tried and true favorites.  The appetizers (while diverse) aren't terribly special as they're about what I'd expect to find at most restaurants (onion rings, quesadillas, artichoke dip, etc.).  I will say that the cinnamon apple dumplin for dessert is pretty tasty.\n\nLike I said, the prices are pretty reasonable at lunch.  Dinner is a little more expensive, but still not bad.  So why 3 stars?  Bottomline, its okay.  Nothing great or amazing, nothing bad or disgusting.  Just decent.  The quintessential suburban barbecue spot.  You'll leave satisfied, but probably longing for the more authentic barbecue joint like me."
2,"Came here with the hubby for the first time. We recently started working out and decided to start eating healthier. I ordered a burger with jicama fries and my husband ordered a wrap with tofu fries. Before coming here, we heard such great reviews of this place. To be completely honest, I wasn't really impressed. The food lacked flavor to me. My husband enjoyed it because he felt it was a healthy meal compared to the stuff we usually eat. I told him that healthy food can also taste good. He recently went back and had a turkey burger and said it tasted dry. There is a place a couple blocks from here called Elixer Organic Cafe that I think is much tastier. I might consider returning here to try something different one day before completely ruling it out."
4,Great place! We have eaten here several times and have enjoyed it every time!! I love the chicken jalfrezi and garlic naan!
3,"Ate here recently and liked it.  I think for the most part you can ignore the Negative Nellies on here...at least some of these donuts are top notch and deserve praise.  The apple fritter specifically - I like it better than any I've had in the area (previous champ = Winchells).  I also liked the boston creme and cake-like donuts.  And, the price is decent, $12.50 for a dozen of basically any 12.  \n\nNow there is some bad news and this is more subjective than anything.  The peanut butter/banana one did not do it for me.  I thought it might but it did not.  Also the smores doughnut was good but it (for me anyway) could have used some \""stuffing\"" inside.  Maybe some hersheys or marshmellow creme would have made it even better.  \n\nI got there at like 8am, had my run of the place.  I don't think it's that odd at all to get to a doughnut shop at 10am and find they are out of everything good.  If anything that's typical (except for maybe Krispy Kreme) and I buy doughnuts all over town several times a month.\n\nIf you like apple fritters please try this place.  If you like doughnuts in general also consider popping in.  I mean a half dozen is what $5 or so - shouldn't break the bank and you probably will be pleasantly surprised."
4,Very nice cozy place. Friendly.  Krystal is the best!
4,"I came here with 5 coworkers and we had a blast! It was a great activity to do with a group of people, or on a date night. \n\nThey had a specific painting that everyone was painting, as the instructor gave direction. I was happy that they encouraged me to do my own piece if I wanted, I'm glad there weren't too many rules. I'd absolutely go again!"
0,"We've tried to go to this IHOP several times. Once, for dinner, we were warned by the staff it would be a long wait for our food, since there was only 1 cook. \nTonight, about 7:00pm, we tried again. It was practically empty & they said the manager was helping cook in the kitchen. After 45 minutes of waiting & 2 rounds of drink refills, we still didn't have our food. We had to get up and go to Denny's. \nSome of the other IHOP locations are just fine! Just not this one!!"
2,"I've been to this airport about 5+ times. And I always wonder why it's so dated? But maybe it's all the slot machines that make it look that way? \n\nRegardless, of it's looks, I've never had any problems with security, delayed flights, or luggage/baggage claim. Usually the wait for baggage is less than 10 minutes (after walking an eternity from the gates to the baggage carousel, the bags are there soon after). \n\nAlso, I got a Jamba Juice from there.. The smallest size they offer and it was $6+. I thought about canceling my order but I needed something to nurse my headache with on my way home to San Jose."
4,"why am I writing a review about my favorite bar? I mean, I was there last friday night and there were all these hipbros (Jack Threads dressed kinda fratty dudes) and they were all loud and dumb. Did they read reviews and decide to show up? Was one of my friends responsible for this, possibly telling one of their work mates about a fun downtown bar? Oh shit... I\""m becoming part of the problem. Well.. the deal is the Rail is the shit. and the owner isn't trying to become some tycoon. He's a pretty sweet older dude. The bartenders are great, the juke box can be a bit fun, the dart are plastic and shitty. This is what rocks. The beers pour nicely. The booze is mighty fine. No redbull or credit card jerkasses. this is to keep things real.\nAre you kinda chill, a bit outside the box? stop in. Are you a douche? eh, you still deserve a shot of fireball... then leave."
0,"God-awful food. Truly the worst Indian food I have ever had anywhere, and I have eaten at a ton of mediocre Indian buffets across this vast country of ours and abroad.\n\nI really wanted to like this place. My husband had asked two Indian colleagues of his where to go for dinner as we'd had a not good experience at Jaipur and were looking for something much better. They both mentioned this place, although neither actually recommended it.\n\nThe atmosphere is welcoming: hip, mostly Desi crowd of all ages, really nice staff, attractive space. Service was friendly but took forever, and when you are dining with a small child that is a distinct problem.\n\nBut the food, oh dear, the food. EVERY last dish, and we ended up ordering 6 after 2 were taken back and replaced, was overwhelmingly sweet. Dishes that should have been creamy, or spicy or piquant were instead just sweet. A cauliflower appetizer we ordered was breaded, deep fried and smothered in tomato ketchup. Other than tasting of  ketchup it was some sort of deep fried bio-mass.\n\nOur server took away 2 of the plates as I mentioned, and tried to make it up to us by bringing other items, but the meal couldn't be salvaged. We all felt sick afterward.\n\nEven with taken 2 entrees off our tab it was still close to $80. Crazy prices for a horrible meal and much more than we are used to spending on Indian food.\n\nCannot in good conscience recommend this place."
3,"OHHHHH SOOOO Eatery!\nI'd be so hungry if I left you now\nCause I don't know where to look for Brews\nI just don't know how!\n\nOHHHHH SOOOO Eatery!\nHow I depend on you\nTo give me Brews when I need it\nright on time for Happy Hour!\n(Lyrics - The Chi-Lites - Oh Girl)\n\nOH! SO good and worth your time.\n\nAt first glance I didn't know what this place was.  I made my stop across the street at JT's.\n\nFinally, I'm glad a made a stop here.  Felt like walking into a neighborhood bar that was full of . . . well . .  my neighbors!  They have a pretty awesome back patio, but that's not to say that the front is lacking.  Dogs are welcomed up front to hang with patrons. The place itself seemed pretty retro and had that summer camp feel.\n\nThey have a huge selection of micro brews and what totally weirded me out was how the bartender remembers which brew was in which tap, since there were no signs or logos attached.  Just plain taps!  Kudos to the person that has to remember all of it!  \n\nI ordered a burger with cheese and a side of fries.  My friends ordered the antipasto platter which came with Elk meat -- cool!  \n\nMy burger was totally awesome with the bacon and cheese.  The patty was nice and juicy while the cheese just oozed over it nicely.  The bun was nice and soft and don't forget to order some nice and crispy fries on the side.  Overall and the bread they used was definitely larger and doughy compared to what I was used to.\n\nThe antipasto platter was great and came with honey mustard and some sort of salsa like sauce.  The meats and pickled veggies was what made it delicious!  Never had elk but wasn't bad at all.  The pickled veggies were pungent and hit up my sinuses where it need to.  Overall, good start and good experience - Enjoy!"
4,By far the best burger in San Tan Valley.. And it comes out of a gas station. Never a bad experience.. Well worth the 6.50.
0,"Horrible service, they made me wait 40 minutes just to get my food to me because they lost my order receipt. They took no initiative to make it right. If you don't receive your order in less that 15 minutes, makes sure you ask what's going on otherwise you'll be there all night. Trust me they won't bother wondering what your still waiting for. There was only 4 other people who ordered how hard is it keep track of 4 orders?!"
2,"TCBY which has the same concept has way more options. You pay for Sm, Md, Lg and then have to pay for every topping you add on. Red Mango only had 4 flavors to pick from. Small amount for the price. The employee didn't smile or greet us. It is a cute little place but way to small to be a hang out place.\n\nAlso recommend going to Campus Candy on State St. Where you pay by the weight and the store is your topping. So you can have as much yogurt and toppings you can fit in your cup.  Its very hard to make up your mind. I always mix my yogurt flavors and layer the toppings in the cup so im not left with just yogurt at the end. Its about. 49 cents an ounce."
2,"I wish we had an Albertson's back at home. Well not to mention that it is the same exact thing as Lucky's in the Bay. So not much difference here. I just miss the name. Anyways it's just your local grocery store, you can get just about anything here grocery-wise. This location just happens to be down the street from my sisters house, so we come here quite often."
3,"I've only been once, but I'll certainly be returning. A smaller, unassuming Indian family restaurant serving South Indian food.\n\nWe went off the beaten track and ordered food I'd never seen anywhere else before - battered mashed potato (stunning),  chili Idli (stunning), and lamb Tanjore (very nice). We also had a paneer dosa that was fantastic.\n\nTheir home made lemonade was lovely, certainly worth trying.\n\nThe food was very fresh, the service was fairly quick considering that the meals were being prepared fresh - we saw the dosa being made (very much like a fresh pizza).\n\nMarked down from 5 because of it being a cash only establishment, leading to some pocket searching between us. They really do need to get card payments sorted out."
4,"The food is excellent here! The French Onion soup is to die for, the fish and steak is so delicious, French fries yum. Salads are so good. Wanted to stay longer in Vegas so I could eat here more often!"
1,Mediocre Food and Pushy Service!
0,"Terrible! Don't believe all the hype. This is for OB.  The tour sounded great, of coarse once we actually had the baby totally different story.   The nurse told me they ran out of pillows. How does a hospital run out of pillows? Then she yelled at my spouse to not help me sit up when i needed his help because her lazy ass would not help me. She literally stuck me in a room and left me there.  I was just lucky that my wonderful mom who is also a nurse from a different hospital came to help me. \n\nThank god the shifts changed and they replaced my terrible nurse with an amazing one (she gets five stars).  \n\nSo did things get better after I had the baby? No! More terrible nurses came to pretend help me.  One nurse even said she needs to take my baby because the labs are running behind then walked out of the room with my baby. Which i was told on the tour would never happen.\nI called my husband and made him hunt her down and bring the baby back.\n\nThey forgot to get me my dinner, its okay i only just delivered. \n\nOne nurse told me my baby was too cold and took the baby to warm the baby up after she blamed me for it. Then came back and said that she could not get my babies body temp up and gave the baby back to me. You know why!?!  Because my baby was not COLD!!!! \n\nOne woman, who was nice but annoying spent a hour trying to get my baby to latch. My baby would not because she was SLEEPY!! Once the nursing police left my baby latched on her own 5 hours later.\n\nSo overall...staff was lazy, rude, annoying, incompetent, and pushy. \n\nHad i know this i would have went to a different hospital."
0,"I loooove IHOP...BUT the manager at this place is a grey haired nasty old rude dude! We came in on a busy day and had an infant asleep in an infant car seat (that I removed from stroller). The manager raised his voice and rolled his eyes appearing very annoyed trying to give me advice on how to place my child in the booth. He insisted he had done this a million times...SO HAVE I. Food is good, as usual. Go to the IHOP at south premium outlets, manager is a doll!!!"
1,I am not sure what the fascination is with these barn like nail and pedicure salons. So many good reviews and I do not agree. Yes it isn't as expensive as a nice spa or salon. But I want to be pampered if I am going to have a pedicure. I want to be able to speak English to someone. I do not want the salon employees to speak any foreign language back and forth while performing services. I could tell they were talking about some of the customers. Rude rude rude. They were short handed and left the phone ring and ring and ring and ring. NOT relaxing. Will never go back. This was my second attempt at finding a great place for a pedi. Very frustrated!!!!
1,"I came in town and needed a quick bite before my conference festivities began. This place was right across the street from my hotel so I skipped on over. The small restaurant with large bar seemed more like a late night hang out than a place known for their good. Either way I was hungry so I wen't ahead and ordered. \n\nI quickly noticed the fish and chips and my mouth began to water. I'm a descendant of the British Commonwealth so I love my fish and chips. I seriously use it as a barometer of deliciousness for new restaurants. Over-all meh. \n\nThe fish was over-fried so it was a bit dry on the ends. I want moist, flaky goodness with a light, crispy batter. Not so here. The only saving grace was their homemade tartar sauce. The whole eating experience was a bland yawn. The coleslaw boring and fish had no taste without tarter. The best part of the meal were the fries. I do not like french fires at all so I guess that's a compliment. This place is a necessary evil for conference travelers that need to eat. I can say that the portion size was good for the price."
3,"Somehow I have lived a block and a half away from Fugu for three years and never tried it.  Something about the exterior (one prominent sign advising \""No Public Restrooms\"" and two more warning of hidden cameras in operation) just turned me off.  That all changed yesterday when my wife and I finally gave it a try.  Oh my God-- absolutely delicious!  I'll get the bad out of the way first-- the restaurant was fairly crowded for 4:00 in the afternoon and only one waiter was working-- there were a lot of tables that hadn't been cleared and we waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  One of our water glasses was also less than clean.  But I don't even care because the food was A-MA-ZING.  I've been craving a decent hot and sour soup ever since I moved to Madison and they delivered.  The chicken with garlic sauce was perfect.  The waiter (who was extremely nice) warned me about how spicy the fried beef in chili sauce would be and he was right.  It was also delicious.   We've eaten there two days in a row now and will definitely be back.\n\nEdit: I'm downgrading this to four stars.  I've been back a number of times (mostly for takeout) and I'll definitely be going back, but it hasn't worked out to be a five-star performance.  \n\nTwo main problems: 1) Consistency: Some things are really, really good and a great value.  Some things are less good (mongolian beef was tough, hunan beef didn't have much beef).  Some things that are often good are sometimes not good (hot and sour soup).  2) Service: Everyone is very nice, but the place just doesn't run well.  They need someone coordinating everything, because the service is slow and out of joint."
3,"I'm an Old Town girl, i.e. if I can avoid having to be on or around Princes Street, I do. Sometimes, though, there's just nothing you can do, and you've gotta cross that imaginary border that exists on Waverley Bridge. \n\nI found the Queens Arms because of the World Cup. You see, I had to be near Stockbridge because a friend of mine who I'd bullied into watching the match with me (and supporting Brazil) had to go to work at 5. So there we were. Pretty hungry and, on my part, excited for the match. \n\nThe Queens Arms has pretty decent, though slightly overpriced pub food. I had a bit of a pathetic 3 onion tart with walnut pesto while my friend bit into a juicy looking burger with chips and chutney. My tart was pathetic not in taste, but in size. I'd expected something somewhat larger for 4 pounds, but hey, sometimes you just gotta be disappointed and deal with it.\n\nWhat wasn't disappointing at all was the decor. For some reason, I'm a fan of people sticking things on ceilings. I went to a bar in Berlin (whose name escapes me) that had furniture on the ceiling and I was delighted. This place has a myriad of empty wine bottles that have been somehow screwed onto the ceiling. I asked few questions, and gawked loads. I also sat out of harm's way. Because. \n\nAnother plus for this place is their selection of ale (priced above 3 pounds). They had a couple of my favourites: Ossian and Thrappledouser as well as (wait for it) Blue Moon, which is one of the tastiest beers I ever had in the States, and quite difficult to find on the isle.  \n\nThough my knowledge of New Town pubs is slim, this is one worth getting to. Good ale, as far as I'm concerned = good pub."
4,"Delicious food, amazing staff, good price. I came here for the buffet and found out they had mango lassi on tap! This place is a gold mine, by far best punjabi style Indian buffet in all of az. Will definitely be back again!"
0,"Kinda mushy pizza here. Barro's is all over this valley, but usually tastes better than what I got here. Not the best salad either. Better places are nearby."
1,"I ordered a salad with chicken for lunch. When it came, it was hard to distinguish the tomatoes b/c they were so small and pale pink. Some of the lettuce was rotten. It took almost 30 minutes for our lunches to come out, and the place was not busy."
3,"Gabi, you are indeed a good friend.  I've been to both locations in Chicago as well as this one in Vegas.  It's perfectly located in the Paris hotel.\n\nFor chain french food, this place is very good.  We went for brunch on a Sunday and enjoyed the crepes.  The smoked salmon and the cheese plate were also great appetizers.  \n\nIf the weather permits, request to sit outside on the patio as it gives you a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is very french, even if the crowd isn't.\n\nThe one odd thing was that they ran out of iced tea during our meal, but they made good on it by subtracting the teas from our bill.\n\nProps to the Paris hotel for targeting the gay market.  The BF and I were pleased to be seated next to four family boys during our lunch.  \n\nAll in all, brunch at Mon Ami Gabi is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon in Las Vegas."
1,"Dear Roka Akor,\n\nI want this to be a love letter but it's not. We had such a short relationship but I feel we have to break up.\n\nI spent $200 at dinner for 3 ozs of fish, one appetizer, and two drinks. And the worst part was it didn't even taste very good. \n\nOur waiter was obsequiously friendly and recommended that if I was a sushi connoisseur I should have the best sushi. Fine, OK, I hear Roka that you are a top 10 sushi restaurant in USA. I have had sushi at some of the others, let's see how you stack up. I am willing to pay for quality.\n\nYour sashimi was of questionably quality, marinated to perdition in order to hide the fishy taste that only emerges when fish begins to rot. The fatty tuna was regular tuna. The portions were tiny! Seriously about 3 ozs of fish for two orders of the chef's choice best sashimi. Some of the flavors of the marinates were quite good, I give you that. But just like spandex does not make the obese look sexy, so vinegar and soy does not make low quality fish sexy. I have eaten fish off the boat at the fish market in Tokyo, not only were you not nearly as good, you weren't even nearly as good as some conveyor belt dining sushi I've had. Don't tell me this is the best you can do!\n\nI must have looked like I had money, or looked too blonde (I'm a brunette btw), because the happy hour menu was never mentioned. Happy hour prices were in effect but the one appetizer I ordered which should have been covered by the happy hour menu was charged at full price. \n\nI couldn't run away from you fast enough. Return? No. Why would I want to return to an abusive relationship?"
3,"We eat here so often, it's only fair that I write a review.  When we can't decide where to have dinner, we go to BJ's.  They seem to have something to please almost everyone.  I usually get the Broccoli Alfredo potato with extra sauce... yum!   Good service, good value.  Great place to bump into your Summerlin neighbors. I appreciate that you can call ahead & be placed on the seating list - sometimes the wait can be upwards of 45 minutes, so calling ahead really saves time, especially when I'm with the 10-year old (or if my guy is hungry... and cranky!)"
3,"I have been going to Massage Envy for a few years now.  I actually bounce around to different locations because that's how I roll.  Actually, it just depends on which Grandma is watching my daughter for me.  \n\nI have been to this particular location several times.  I like this location because it has a nicer staff than some of the other locations I have been too.  I have also been quite pleased with every masseuse I have had.  They seem to be of a higher quality than some of the other locations.  It's also pretty easy to get to, being right off of the 215 and Flamingo.  The quiet room here is also very relaxing and really helps you get into the massage mood.  You know what I mean,  whether it is ahhh, namaste, ohm,  the room just gets you ready for your massage.\n\nThe only downside is the parking.  The way this strip mall is situated, the parking area can really get packed if you go at the wrong time.  There are a lot of stores, restaurants, fast food, and other things all around the area.  Keep that in mind if you are heading in during the lunch or dinner rush, to make sure you have enough time to get in, in case you have to park far away."
0,"I suppose getting screamed at and made to feel like a idiot for NON safety issues is common place here. I will never return to this dump, most of the staff are normal but a few are complete dicks. I will make it a point to turn away as many people as possible, paying customers should not be treated this way!"
3,"This spot is awesome.  Every time I've been to Vegas and stayed at Harrah's I've checked it out.  This past weekend I was there and experienced their largest \""purple drink\"", as I call it (and no its not THAT purple drink), and it ended my night with style.  I'll upload a photo so you can see the enormity of a $35 crown and coke.\n\nGreat live music on some nights, and good DJs on other nights.  They are also outdoor, so if you stop in with friends who aren't quite 21 they can chill outside and listen to music while you get your drink on."
3,"Garcia's has been part of the Valley for decades.  It always brings back good family memories.  The food doesn't disappoint.  I am so glad the moved in this area.  This was their first week, they had a few opening glitches but they overcame.  Good basic Mexican cuisine.  This location is small, so check the wait time."
4,"In a food court full of calorie filled menus (and people entirely too overdressed to go shopping), it's refreshing to have a guilt-free option like Crunch Bistro.\n\nMy order: Portobello Wrap. Sun dried tomato tortilla. roasted portobellos, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, spinach and balsamic vinaigrette. Portobellos, goat cheese and roasted red peppers: a trio of perfection. Every sandwich, wrap, salad, whatevs... should contain those three items. \n\nMy lunchtime friends went with salads: the Waldorf and the Cali Crunch. Both added portobellos. The salads looked amazing. The ingredients... so fresh. I can not wait to go back and get one.\n\nCrunch seems like a pretty popular spot in the food court. Steady stream of people during the hour and half I was there. I must say, it is discouraging to look around at the tables and see parents feeding their kids fast food when there's such a delicious and healthy place like this there. \n\nThis will be my new go-to spot to grab grub when I'm shopping at SouthPark Mall. If you see a girl wearing pajamas in the food court, say hi. It'll probably me. I'm pretty sure I'm the only who goes to the mall not dressed to the nines."
3,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! i just got back home but i had an awesome experience here at the RIO hotel and casino. The IBAR was a bit expensive but me and my friends just drank in the room prior to coming down to the bar so that saved us some money, but as far as atmosphere, it was great! very fun place and their mixed drinks are sooooo delish!"
1,"Me&hubby needed a fast lunch - haven't been to KFC in years - stopped in. I don't like when the cashier WAITS at the register for you to look over the menu. Like I said we haven't been in for years and needed to look over menu. We were the only ones in line and asked questions that I am not sure the guy understood. He'd say something then someone from the back said something too. Confusing! Finally deciding on the Chicken Littles, we asked for 1 side of mashed potatoes\n and 1 of cole slaw.Of course, when we got home there were 2 cole slaws. Idk - there are SO very many places to go for a bite - think we are done with KFC for another few years."
1,"When we first moved to Charlotte, NC from Savannah, I was really looking forward to trying Southern food here. A lot of people suggested Mert's. One word-YUCK! We ordered simple items. Fried chicken, macaroni and cheese and collards. The chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland. The service wasn't great either. She leaned over our table,with her butt in the other patrons face the entire time. Not impressed. I went a second time just in case they were having a bad day. I ordered catfish with okra and tomatoes. Again-YUCK! The catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it. The okra and tomatoes were alright. Still searching for a great southern restaurant."
1,"For a celebrity chef's burger restaurant it was very disappointing! Had sliders and they were poor to fair. First order arrived cold and sent it back - refire was cold too! Tasted pre made and industrial. A disappointment and I just had a simpler from the happy our menu. Glad I was out only 10 bucks for my sliders and a beer. Again, disappointing !"
2,"Its nice to see a Louisiana style place open in Pittsburgn and the location is great.. However, after just being to New Orleans and coming here I can say its not really comparable to a nice restaurant down there. Food is pretty overpriced and just doesn't taste quite right. Service was pretty good, and its a big restaurant with free valet parking. Its decorated tastefully too."
1,So I really have to knock this place down a few stars since my last visit. They have a the chairs lined up and everyone sits side by side (it kind of reminds me of a sweatshop). Other clients come in to get a massage and are super loud and inconsiderate of other people trying to relax.  The owner was also watching tv on an iPad or computer that you could hear while getting your massage. Annoying? I think yes! They even have a sign for recommended tips. I mean if you really have to tell people how much to tip your business model probably needs work! \nThis place could be so much better if they just put some money into spacing out the chairs and cutting down on the chatter by placing a wall between the pay area and massage area.
1,"Boring. It's a City Walk wanna be.\n\nPretty much against my will I came out here because one of Mike's friend's was in town and staying with someone who lived out here. I was hoping to convince them to meet in the middle and go downtown, but no luck. I don't get why you would take an out-of-towner here when it's nothing, but chains, but whatever. \n\nThere's nothing special about this place. It was very bright and they blocked off the road between Saddle Ranch and Margaritaville, although I'm not sure why because I didn't think the area was that busy. The only plus here was the parking was free."
3,"Awesome selection of cigars in the humidor - all the major brands covered and it was nice and spacious.  The bartenders were great and quickly got paired whiskies to our table outside with a side of water!  Outside misters provide additional cooling, in the evening the sun is not direct so it's a nice cool atmosphere.  I was interested in the members only section of the club, but did not inquire - perhaps on my next visit!"
0,"Sucked, ordered a BBQ Chicken Sicilian pizza and they gave me a regular. There was no BBQ sauce in it. The seafood calzone had more bread and grease then actual meat. And the service was shit. No more from me."
3,Love the food and service. My only complaint is the portions of pizzettes. They looked like a dish from the kids' menu. Octopus was great. It is must try dish.
3,"Though we are non locals, we are allowed to have computer privileges which we use frequently while on vacation.  There are a sufficient quantity of computers so we never have to wait.  The staff is very friendly and helpful."
4,"Probably the best way to get around the strip. It's fast enough and gets you where you need to go. But if you want to get to like the Stratosphere or Circus Circus, be prepared for a bit of a walk."
1,"So disappointing...it is supposed to be one of the top luxury hotels in Madison but seems to lack luxury. \n\nGood - Entrance, Bar, Restaurant all seem welcoming and very snazzy - beautiful lake views.  \n\nBad - Rooms (Jr Suite is where we stayed).  Reminds me of a days inn or something sub-par.  Fridge was warmer than ambient air temperature.  TV's are still tubes.  Couch/furnishings are completely worn out.  For $200+ per night you'd expect luxury not motel.  If all the rooms are similar to this - please put a little money into your rooms.  \n\nIf you are wanting a luxury hotel experience, please look elsewhere.  I understand that this hotel is from an \""era\"", but I would expect it to keep up with the luxury hotel market as well.  \n\nMy recommendation  - stay somewhere else."
0,Saw such great reviews but was very disappointed. The Pho was overpowered with star anise and something else. Not very well balanced in flavors like I'm used to with Pho Thanh close by and homemade pho. I ordered the #1 and got maybe 1 edible piece of brisket and the rest was tripe. Read good reviews on the banh mi sandwiches but they were out of bread. I will most likely not be back again as it was memorable in a bad way.
0,"If I could i would give this place ZERO stars because it was terrible! The food is terrible and the service, even worse! We had a large party of 12 expecting to have a lovely evening. Instead 3 of us were given the wrong order, and the waitress tried to convince two people to just eat what they were served. The appetizers were forced upon us and worst of all, I being a vegetarian asked the waitress for advice on what to order and she encouraged me to order the one pasta dish that I found out later was cooked in BEEF STOCK definitely NOT vegetarian. To make matter matters even worse it came out far too salty. I asked others at the table to try and we all agreed that it was inedible!  With that said I found out later from another server that the order was indeed BEEF or VEAL stock. I was so disappointed.  \n\nFor desert they brought our food but forgot to give us silverware and were unreachable for at least 10 mins. \n\nIt is first a terrible restaurant for the service, secondly for the food.  But most importantly for the atmosphere, all of the guests seemed to be desperate to be picked up or to be seen at a austentatious place. However this was trashy and without class. You definitely see so, throw what the server's attire. Majorly inappropriate and poorly made!!! I WOULD NEVER GO BACK."
4,I was pleasantly surprised by this venue. I stopped in to kill time and ordered this delightful cookie brownie evil decadent thing and I was not disappointed. Very clean and the vegetarian menu was put together well. Worth a second visit indeed.
2,"I'm revising my previous review. The spa has made several attempts to rectify the situation as well as apologize, and  in all fairness I can't leave a one star review. There could have been better communication, but the overall ambience, cleanliness and customer service deserves more than one star.\n\nOld review:I really hate to give a one star, but I feel I have no choice. I went in for my first facial in months. Left it up to the aesthetician as to what I should get as they are the experts. I had a couple of milia that needed to be addressed as well as looking at an anti-aging facial. No steam which I love especially here in Arizona. In fact, I don't think  I have ever had a facial that did not use steam to soften the face. Usually after a good facial my skin would feel more polished and taut. Nope. The small white dots are still there, but I am out over $90 with tip.\n\nHuge disappointment; huge waste of time and money. I am not going to say the name of the girl who worked on me, but I will never go back and could never recommend it. Yes, it's clean etc, but I expect a real facial when I pay for one.\n\nI really wonder about all these other top reviews."
3,"You know those nights you can't be bothered to cook? \n\nOr put on makeup? Or blow out your hair? Or put on a bra? Or take off those Yoga pants that are comfortably plastered to your behind? \n\nThis was me on a Saturday night after competing in a Track and Field meet in Coolidge earlier that day. And it seemed Andrew C. was on the same page after an extended day at work.\n\n\""Why not Thai food?\"" I remember Monica O. and Cheryl B. had raved about Thai Chili, so I pulled up the menu. \n\nTurns out they do take-out! YES, LOW MAINTENANCE EVENING!\n\nWe called and ordered the Mussamun Curry with chicken at Thai Hot level 8, and the Drunken Noodles with chicken at Thai Hot level 6.\n\nMade the trek out to Gilbert. Friendly cashier, and she gladly accepted the 5% off your order with a Yelp check-in. Seems like they do a lot of carry out here, but there was a nice dining area. \n\nThis stuff smelled heavenly. Was practically drooling on the drive home. \n\nGot home, popped open a bottle of wine and our to-go containers.\n\nHoly smokes, this stuff was HOT. Like, open the containers and your eyes start running hot. \n\nThe Mussaman Curry was my favorite of the two. Beautiful, rich, creamy orange color. Savory coconut milk, tender chicken, carrots and potatoes. The only weird thing was the potatoes seemed to have this funky taste, like they were freeze dried.\n\nWhile the Drunken Noodles were delish and a good balance of chicken and vegetables, the dish didn't seem to be very saucy. Dry, almost. \n\nAlso, ironically, the Drunken Noodles which we ordered at a lower heat level than the Mussaman Curry were unbearably hot (at least for me)! Maybe they mixed them up? \n\nEither way, it was reasonably priced and a great discovery. I anticipate we'll be back again and again . . . Lazy night in or nice night out!"
2,"I absolutely used to love this place. I drive over from Mt Edge several times per week to have coffee here. Went Sunday and not so impressed. First of all it was cold outside and freezing inside. The outdoor heaters were not on. I was waiting to order and no one came over. A girl that worked somewhere in Tivoli walked in and they ran right over. Of course they had to chat and I had to wait. But I am not in a hurry, so I stayed patient. I ordered a Breve. It tasted good, but was only lukewarm. My teeth were chattering so I drank it fast to leave. The server made some smart comment about my fast consumption of beverage. Ah, tomorrow Sambalatte. And everyone wonders why they don't make it?"
2,"We came to Michael Mina's to celebrate my husbands birthday.  We originally made a 6:30pm reservation on a Saturday night but had to push the time later on to 8:30pm.  The restaurant was kind enough to accommodate a later time for us.  The server who took care of us was extremely friendly and highly experienced at serving on a timely manner.   I have no complaints when it comes to their superb service and food quality.  I was hoping that this would turn out to be a 5 star dining experience but after reviewing the tasting menu, all six of us were not at all excited to try it.  We had no other choice but to opt for the Porterhouse for two people.  \n\nIf I thought that everyone would end up ordering steak, I would've suggested going to an actual steakhouse.  Reluctantly we all got the steak and hoped for the best.   We also ordered the Foie Grais appetizer along with Lobster Ravioli.  Both were super delicious and I strongly recommend starting off your dinner with those two appetizers.   We also ordered the foie grais fried rice to go with our steak.  I can eat this everyday!  Highly recommended and must order dish!  \n\nThe bread basket had an assortment of both slightly sweet and savory breads.  They were mediocre and no one really enjoyed the bread basket.  We expected better tasting bread.  \n\nThe steak came with a variety of vegetables on the side.  The servers would cut about three pieces and serve it on your plate.  The rest were sitting inside an oval pan.  We were super hungry and everyone was in a rush to eat their meal.  I like my porterhouse steak from Mastro's compared to Michael mina's.  If the tasting menu had better choices, I would've ordered that instead.  Afterall, I was looking forward to trying the tasting menu.  Ordering steak was never on my mind prior to looking at the menu.  Even the other a la carte options didn't sound all that great.   Maybe in the future I'll give this place another try. \n\nWhat we LOVED about this place was their famous Root beer float with cookie dessert.   I really don't like root beer but the pastry chef here really did a great job creating this masterpiece!  Both the drink and the cookies were just melt in your mouth yumminess!   They brought out this cute little dessert with a candle for the birthday boy!  it was a  chocolate peanut butter candy bar with broken up nuggets of peanut butter sugar candies.  Quite interesting and great tasting! \n\nOverall I had a 3.5 star experience!"
3,"Their drive thru is the only way I have ever experienced Z.  I have enjoyed just about everything I have had here thus far.  Every time I go it is essential I get a side salad (with all that wonderful feta), hummus, tsatziki, and falafel.  The fries are not my favorite side there.  \nTheir gyros are good not great and I still have several items to try on the menu.  The pita leaves much to be desired, almost like it is warmed in a microwave, as soon as it cools it 's tough and dry. Sad as the pita makes the meal, typically, at Mediterranean restaurant. But it also won't keep me from going back..."
4,"Have a starbucks while you wait, iced matcha green tea latte, 1 pump chai, with organic soymilk. Always a smooth entry, lines move fast, view is great."
2,"Feel like the food and drinks are overpriced, the food is good, but for the amount and type of ingredients feel it's too pricey. Have had inconsistent service so can't really comment on it, once it was pretty good, the other two times I've been it felt like it was a bother to them to serve and there were only two other people inside."
0,They must be popular. I was out in Youngtown and had a break so I decided go get my nails some. I got turned away. They asked if I could come back tomorrow. Disappointed I didn't get to check out their work & can't say that il be back. Too bad.
0,"Don't do it. I know, I know- the chef has been on Chopped. That's awesome, but the restaurant is not. The jelly selection is impressive (if not a little overwhelming), but the food is just...no. I ordered the corned beef hash and it had no flavor. I expected more than what looked like canned hash and tasted even worse. Could have been an off day, but I generally give places two tries because everyone can have a bad day; unfortunately for this establishment though, I'm not feeling that generous."
0,"I stopped by on a day where they were having a test drive event along with free food like burgers and hot dogs.\n\nWhat a complete waste of time. They completely ignored me when I walked in. For the 15 minutes I was walking around and looking at the scooters, they didn't even bother to ask if I had any questions or if I wanted a test drive. They were more interested in talking to each other and their friends that were just there hanging out. \n\nI thought the idea of running a business is to make money. Perhaps I am sorely mistaken because it seems like they didn't want any customers bothering them during their conversations.\n\nWhen I decide to purchase a scooter, I will go look elsewhere even if I have to drive across town. I suggest you do the same and take heed of all the rest of the bad reviews for this \""business.\"""

0,"Wow. I wouldn't even believe what I am about to write if I didn't experience it myself. I'm not one to really lambast a place unless they deserve it, but this experience was truly ridiculous. \n\nI dropped off a pair of lined wool pants and a pair of gloves on 12/18. The gloves are synthetic material with leather strips on the fingers and a leather palm. Normally, I would wash them myself, but they have some of that \""smart fabric\"" on the thumb and forefinger for use with a touch screen. When I dropped the stuff off, the guy told me that they might have to send it out because of the leather. The price for that was unreasonable, so I said if they couldn't do it in-house to just not bother. He said they would call if they could not do the gloves, otherwise, I could pick everything up on the 22nd. Fine, no problem. I didn't get around to stopping back until yesterday, 12/27. \n\nI walk in and hand the guy my ticket. He goes into the back, where I can see rows and rows of hanging, cleaned items under plastic. Given that my order was supposed to have been ready 5 days prior, one would assume that my clothes would be on such a hanger. They have a sign behind the counter that is sort of one-way glass/mirror, but I could see through it. The guy walked into the back and I could see him rummaging below. He picks up my pants, puts them on a hanger and covers it in plastic. He puts the gloves in a bag and ties it to the hanger and brings it out. He seemed a bit dodgy and told me that they couldn't do the gloves. I said okay and asked what I owed him. He said that I had pre-paid when I dropped off. This was not what I recalled, because we had a conversation about the gloves and what the charge would be, etc, but he was the one looking at the computer, so I shrugged and left. It all seemed a bit weird and off, but I it was raining and had things to do, so I just took the bag and left. \n\nWhen I got home, I pulled the plastic off the pants that were poorly hung on the hanger and THEY WERE NOT CLEANED. Not even a little bit. They had the exact same wrinkles in them as when I dropped them off. What the heck?? I am usually one who is pretty relaxed about mistakes and I'm perfectly happy if a business makes a honest mistake and makes a fair gesture to rectify it. In this situation, if the guy had just said that (for example), when they determined that they could not clean the gloves there was a misunderstanding and the pants were not cleaned either and then offered to clean them for free or at half price or give me one-day service or anything of the sort--they may have earned a customer. \n\nBut instead, they appear to have lied to my face and intentionally deceived me.\n\nAs I said, I don't think that I did pay for the service, but what the heck was that guy thinking? I wasn't going to notice that my pants were a wrinkled mess and weren't even touched? I guess he thinks people can't see him behind that mirror? Did he think I'd be less pissed off if I believe I *paid* to have them keep my pants in a pile in their store for nine days? \n\n I chose Four Seasons because they purport to use a \""greener\"" method of dry cleaning. I don't know if that is true either, but I can assure you they'll never see any of my green. What a ridiculous experience."
4,"It's the first time I've \""Yelped\"" anything other than a restaurant. However, after spending the better part of a day enjoying the Art/Natural History Museums, I'm branching out...guess I'm way overdue! \n\nUndoubtedly, there are plenty of bores who cannot imagine a quality museum anywhere west of Bilbao. Pay them no mind. The range and quality of exhibits at the Carnegie are rightly rich sources of pride and accomplishment to the organization and Pittsburgh. And, each and every staff member I spoke with was courteous, helpful and obviously well trained...something that's not always the case in many exalted European settings. If you're traveling with children you'll appreciate the numerous interactive areas created for the kids.  \n\nPittsburgh is so much more than football, hockey and salads with hidden french fries (tell me again why they do that?). You'll completely understand when you visit the Carnegie Museums."
2,"Real hole in the wall restaurant. Great burgers and fries. Burger and salad bar to choose your own toppings, which all seemed fresh.\n\nBad part of town. Service is abrupt."
1,"Mediocre at best. Green tea was luke warm, rolls took longer than usual to be prepared (empty restaurant). Nothing was super amazing, I would rather go to just about any other Sushi place."
4,"I was recently in NC checking out the area as I am possibly moving down there this upcoming year.  I am currently in NY this place had excellent Food and Service.  Babyback Ribs, Mac and Cheese, Baked Beans and southern burger were EXCELLENT!  If you live nearby this place is a great place to go with the family!  If you don't live nearby this is a great place to get some GREAT southern style BBQ!"
2,"Good burger, but man it is greasy!  I guess thats what makes it good though, right?\n\nMilkshake was pretty good too.  \n\nNot my first choice for a burger joint, but I would eat here again."
0,"GHETTOMART best describes this hell hole!\n\nWhen I drove into this places driveway the first thing going thru my mind was; \""am I going to get mugged or hold-up just getting out of my car!\"" With trash all over the parking lot I seriously wonder if they ever clean their parking lot! \n\nThen somehow due to the promise of cheaper prices I made it in the store. Even with all the security cameras I was still worried if I was going to get robbed in this joint.(All I'll say is there was a lot of conspicuous /shady characters shopping in this place.)\n\nI asked a question where the light bulbs were, and the person working the floor was very short with me! I think she was worried she was going to get mugged in this place too! I found my light bulbs & went to one of the mega lines. With twenty check stands they only had two open & 15 customers standing in lines! (You got to be freaking be Kidding me!) At this point I decided to leave GHETTO  MART/WALMART, & drive 1/2 mile east to 44th street & Thomas & go to Target instead. (Much Cleaner, just as inexpensive!)\n\nI can't believe WALMART is the #1 private employer in the State of Arizona???\nWALMART truly is the DEATH STAR to our economy!"
3,"Went for Mother's Day Dinner and even with a reservation, waited about 20 minutes but the food was worth it.\n\nAppetizer - Grilled Calamari- so tender and juicy.  You can't get that kind of tender meat without the squid being very fresh.\nClam Chowder - Awesome\n\nEntree - Sea Bass with - the fish was very fresh and good but it was not memorable. - amazing.  the fish was a little flavorless but the spicy and rich broth made up for it. best sea in the west coast ....\n\nDessert-  amazing  too"
3,"I was surprised by the quality of service we received here!  My drink never had a chance to get empty, and we were checked on often enough but without feeling like our privacy was being invaded.  \n\nI ordered the vegetarian combo with a cheese enchilada & a bean tostada with refried beans & rice.  All of it was way saltier than I like, but it wasn't inedible.  And consistency-wise, the enchiladas could learn something from the overly-pureed beans; I needed a knife for the former and could have used a spoon on the latter.  I had a bite of my boyfriend's chile relleno, and it was okay but not what I'm used to from taquerias in Chicago.  The complimentary chips and salsa were great.. perfectly light crispy chips and the salsa with pico de gallo in it was really good.  If the rest of the food was as good as the chips & salsa, they'd get a 5 star rating.  Everything was very reasonably priced.   \n\nThe restaurant itself was bright, colorful & clean."
4,"For the prices Luxor offers a stay at,  you can't beat it. We stayed in the tower in a regular room with 2 queen beds, a flat screen and a jacuzzi. Friends that stayed in the pyramid had a great room as well, but ours was a bit nicer I think. \n\nI did not know what to expect from the exhibits at Luxor but all I can say is.. WOW. Totally worth the money to go into Bodies and Titanic. Totally different experiences in each but both are mind blowing I don't want to ruin anything for anyone just go see them. We had a chance to see Criss Angel as well.. Cool show, I am still trying to figure out some of the tricks.\n\nAurora and Flight, the bars in the casino were a great hang for mid day. They have happy hour specials or you can check in on Foursquare and your first drink is buy one get one. Great deal and the bartenders were awesome. They made great drinks and and were very personable.\n\nWe went to LAX one night and did bottle services. May I recommend Peach Ciroc to everyone since that night! our server was amazing. She was there every time we needed her, our ice was always full and replaced if melting..the security for the tables were a blast. They did a great job but still managed to have fun and engage with the guests that wanted it. While there someone on stage got a bottle.. and people dressed as Starwar's characters brought the bottles out shot out confetti danced and then left. Completely random but so awesome! The music was great as well.\n\nWhile there make sure to eat at Tacos&Tequila. I had the Carne Asada Tacos, and they rocked. \n\nAll in all, I will be back. This place exceeded my expectations!!!!"
0,I got food poisoning here.
0,"Came to the Silverado grille at about 430pm  in the afternoon and restaurant.com and yelp both wrote that they were open at this time but apparently they say close at 4pm. Leah the bartender/server was very nice and tried to accommodate me but the cook Zack was unhelpful. Even though I said that I drove all the way over here,  he still wouldn't cook anything at all. Very disappointing. Will not be back."
2,"Our first time here for valentines day was excellent. The second time was not however. Therefore it gets 3 stars. I made my reservation on opentable and requested a booth. Well, that didn't happen and nothing was done for my gf's birthday. Kind of odd. \n\nWe'll be going back for sure. The food is excellent but the service was lacking the second time around. Maybe we hit it on a bad night."
0,"Scheduled an appointment here today based on yelp. Appointment setter was pleasant on phone. Appt was for 12:30, arrived early because I do for all appts, As I value & don't waste other peoples time. Waiting goes into 15 minutes, than now almost 20 minutes & when I thought I heard wax person come for her (my) next appt, she instead comes out to show photos on her cell phone to a client. By this time, she is 20 minutes late for a SCHEDULED appt & obviously no respect or care for being on-time for appts. I canceled & left. That was rude & unprofessional, I would not recommend anyone here with that type of unprofessionalism."

3,"You get a very nice room at a reasonable rate, and it's right on the edge of the quad.  Book early - you're lucky to get a room if there's a football game or other special events happening.  Even without special events, it is sometimes full.  Downstairs, the Illini Union has a dining, a bookstore, pool hall, bowling, ATMs, and more.  Plus free parking and Internet access."
3,"I think that first review was pretty harsh. The dude there does know quite a bit about laser tattoo removal, he worked in a shop in another town before moving here and starting up his own business. \nThe shop is very clean and the furniture is modern the walls are white i instantly felt at ease. This place isn't sketchy or dirty. He cares about his business and answered all my questions. Like how even though Ill probably be completely healed in the next 1-2 weeks, I have to wait 6-8 weeks before coming back because the ink continues to work itself out over that period! weird!\n\nThe procedure itself, though a painful, is so fast, literally less then five minutes to zap my entire 6\"" square area and if I hadn't needed to take 10 second breathers here and there it would have been faster.  He also applied a cold pack to the area before we began to help numb the area. I appreciate that. \n \nHe does use different attachments for zapping different colors, and black was the worst. When he zapped my green area, it didn't hurt at all. I'm told green, yellow and white are the hardest to remove, however Im not going for full removal, I just need to lighten it a bit for a cover up. \n\nIt was my first experience with laser tattoo removal, I had a groupon for 2 sessions for $100. I can't afford the regular price, so Im hoping to try another place out via a groupon if one pops up for the purposes of scientific comparison, and for you, the review readers. Im only here to yelp. \n\nSo for now Im giving it 4 stars, but I will update it when I have another shop to compare it to."
1,"Bleh a knock off version of Fat Tuesdays. I love Fat Tuesdays, but we were here so I needed a drink. $21 for a foot long?! it was really icy too.... Eh thankfully I had a Fat Tuesday the day after because this place was not crackin."
4,"Let me start by saying that i have consistently had great experiences at LAVO! The food and service is truly wonderful here! I usually order the kobe meatball for an appetizer and the lasagna for my main entree. This week i switched it up and after looking at how good the pictures of the veal parmigiana was i had to see if was as good as it looked.. INDEED it was worth every penny. This actually was my first time even eating Veal and i think i've found my new favorite dish here at LAVO! My friend i was with ordered the traditional spaghetti & meatballs. HUGE portions which is always a plus, very tasty! For dessert the Tiramisu was yet another home run!! 5-stars guys!"
0,"I have been going here for about two years now. My wait times are usually long. The waiting room is usually empty when I arrive, so I can never understand why it always takes 10 - 15 minutes to see me, then another 10 - 15 minutes for the doctor to arrive.  \n\nThere are plenty of thing that still irk me about this place besides waiting: They take a lunch from noon until 1:30 pm, so if you have a lunch break and need to talk to someone, tough luck. Why do they need an hour and a half for everyone to take a lunch? Also, getting test results used to come through email or they would call me. Now I have to call them, then call back several times to see if I need to see the Dr again because I'm still sick. Then they tell me he might be sending me a referral in the mail but they don't know yet... SO I wait for the mail to arrive for a week and nothing.  Do I call back? Has Dr Tran decided whether I should get a referral yet? \n\nIt's so strange. \n\nI am buying myself a car today just so I can go to see a doctor I don't have to walk to. This place is far too disorganized."
2,"Found this place online and since my in-laws are in town, we thought we'd give it a try. I can't pinpoint what style it was, but I sure wasn't impressed by the decoration of the restaurant. Before the entree came, I was a little worried about picking the wrong place, because the calamari and the caesar salad were just ok. The sauce on the calamari was a little sweet and the caesar salad was kinda bitter. Bread was good though, very warm and fluffy. When the entree came up to the table, we were all admired how pretty everyone's dish looked. The chief sure knows how to please your eyes before you eat.\nI had the Beef Tenderloin, it was cooked a little more done than I like, but I DID NOT send it back, instead, I finished that whole plate. The sauce was flavorful but not overpowering, the meat was tender and juicy, and a lit of veggies and potato made the dish so perfect.\nThe place is a little on the pricey side, but I think for the quality of the food, it's totally worth it if you want to have a special night out."
3,"WAY low prices, and very decent sushi.  They almost always have toro, which is a big plus in my book, and it's actually inexpensive in relation to other sushi places, which makes it even better.  Most importantly, the sushi has always been fresh.\n\nI've never ordered off the regular menu, and I've always sat at the bar, so I can't speak to the service other than the sushi chef, and his service is consistently good.  This place consistently passes my \""tea test\"" with flying colors (iced tea glass is refilled at 3/4 empty at a minimum, and never allowed to go dry).\n\nThe plating certainly isn't the most elegant or artistic, but the fish is fresh and tasty and the prices are low, so that offsets the visual appeal (or lack thereof).\n\nIf your usual idea of sushi is a place with sleek, modern decor, thumping music, expensive eats and lots of 20-somethings slamming sake bombers (can you say Ra?), this is not the place for you.  Sushi Ken is hidden behind some other buildings in a strip mall, and absolutely lacks ambiance.  Nonetheless, the fact that I have often been the only patron with round blue eyes lends credence to my opinion that the food is \""authentic\"" (for whatever that's worth) and well-prepared."
2,"We were going to eat here but decided not to at this time since we had just ate breakfast and knew where we wanted to eat lunch and dinner,so this is my first review where we went in talk to the family owned place which they were  so very nice and friendly the owner,son and daughter, this place was spotless I wonder if it is like that all the time and not because they had just open for the day, this place is founded by Firemen's,there are so many fire Items around in here,from the photo's,fire coat's and hat's,the deco is so cool like you are in a fire house eating.  We will absolutely eat here so I can review the food too.Almost forgot to say that when you sign up for the newsletter you receive a free large drink when you purchase a sub.sandwich also promo's, offer's,and a free med. celebratory sub."
1,"The food is cheap, but not a lot of meat on the sandwich. The fries on top of the sandwich were cold but the coleslaw on the sandwich was great."
2,"I haven't been in to the rooms, but I've walked through the casino a number of times. I took a better look at the games they have to offer on my latest visit and was surprised at how much larger the place was than I thought from the front of it.  It's not as nice as it's sister property in New Orleans, but it's also much older. The drink service was good and all in all it wasn't a bad time. \n\n The card readers on the machine all seemed to be a bit finicky when it came to inserting my players club card; i found the bank of machines we wanted to play on and had to figure out which of them would actually accept the cards. The ticket redemption machine was not working either so I had to go to the cashier to collect."
1,"My man & I have been craving ramen for a while so we decided to be \""Adventurous\"" and give this somewhat new place a try. It actually only took 13 minutes to get here from Rhodes Ranch so that was plus! When we got there all the tables were taken so we sat at the empty bar. Pretty soon we were joined by other diners at the bar and I had to move my purse off the stool next to me which sucked because they don't have hooks or a little shelf to put purses on and my purse is huge. hmmm We both got tonkatsu-shoyu ramen which is not on the menu but they were able to accommodate so yay. We also got a half order of gyoza and karage chicken wings. \n\n-Karage Chicken Wings- 4 pieces, nicely seasoned but way too greasy. I think Fukumimi's version of serving it more as a popcorn chicken style works better. \n-Half Order of Gyoza- 3 pieces.. nothing memorable. \n-Tokatsu-Shoyu Ramen: First off, I think there was just way too little soup compared to everything else.. The broth itself tasted just like soup that you could get from a packet of .99c ramen. There was no deep, rich flavor that said oooh I've been cooking for 6+ hours instead it was just plain and boring. Maybe it was our fault for getting something not offered on the menu? The Chashu.. OMG what a disappointment... there was no melting in the mouth action what so ever. If anything it was more on the tough side and just not the business. The egg was perfectly soft boiled but more on the salty side. The only thing I liked about my ramen was the noodles. They were cooked aldente so they had a nice bite and they were of the thin variety that I like.   \n\nService, although very friendly, was very spotty. For instance.. When we got our gyoza we were not given a soy sauce tray, when our ramen came out they only brought 1 spoon and we had to flag her down to ask for more water... \n\nSomething else that was weird was there were no toilet seat covers in the women's restroom... HAHAHA yea i'm weirdo so I wanted to include this in the review. but isn't that like a health code violation? idk ... \n\nRight now Shoku is at the bottom of our ramen list. I really want to try the lobster miso ramen which is the main reason we came here in the first place but I don't know when they will have it again.. I feel bad giving them a low review but we just weren't impressed. \n\nHOT TIP:  Make sure to check out the specials' board.. We forgot to ..They had a couple interesting items like kimchi ramen & tan tan men.. Also don't forget to get a stamp card."
2,Better than subway but nothing special.
2,I will land in the middle of Andrea K and Gabi K.  The hotel was gorgeous and great for people watching for sure!  At the ground floor was a lounge area called 'The Living Room' we had a very pricey drink although mine was good others had to send theirs back.  We were lucky that we were on the lists or I would have been feeling like Andrea mentioned in her review.  This is not Hollywood or New York this is Scottsdale people... get a grip on yourself and where you are.  There is no need to make people feel like they are not welcome... for that reason alone I was not that impressed with this place.  Once upstairs we walked around and checked the scene out.  They have a great pool area with very comfy looking lounge chairs... a small bar by the pool and another large one right when you first get upstairs.  I went to the smaller one to 'try' and get a drink... I think I was ignored for about 10 minutes or so till I finally said something and got a mediocre mixed drink that was not cheap either.  I cannot say that I wont be back for a drink again... maybe when the hype dies down.
4,"This review is long over due, but none the less warranted.  Last summer, SUNDAY July 21st (it was 110 degrees) to be exact, our 30 year old a/c died.  It was our sons 17th birthday and the party had to be cancelled.  We have known the Hays from their participation within our community and called them asap..  They had a technician over (on a Sunday!) within hours to confirm our diagnosis - we needed a new cooling/heating unit.  This tech got on our roof in the middle of a crazy monsoon storm!  Within hours, we heard FROM THE OWNER,  talking with us about what their service tech confirmed.  They were actually out of town when they contacted us! (I'm not so sure I could interrupt my vacation for work - but they did!)  Within 2 days, we had a new cooling/heating system on our roof - even helped us with some awkward 30 year old duct work.  We could not BE HAPPIER!  Thank you Hays!  We really appreciated your over the top service."
2,"I really wanted to like this place more than I did. I love that is it like a classic WI supper club- complete with pickled eggs and pork hocks. We sat at the bar, and although the service was friendly, I felt it was really slow- it took a very long time for them to initially acknowledge us or for us to receive our food or be checked on, but at least they nice!\n\nThey do beer flights for $1/beer sample in increments of 4, 8, or 12- what a good deal! And you can choose any of their over 40 beers on tap. Of course we ordered the cheese curds, which were greasy and delicious. Otherwise I was kind of disappointed in the food. I ordered the Wurst platter, two of my sausages were under cooked, and they all were just overall bland. My boyfriend ordered the chili cheese dog- the hot dog was very good, but the chili was the worst chili I have ever had- literally no seasoning at all (and I have very low chili standards) There was also barely any cheese on it at all. I think that maybe they were just having an off day, or we just ordered the wrong items of the menu, but based off their food alone I would not come back. \n\nA great place to try some WI beers and cheese curds, but maybe go elsewhere to eat."
3,"The service and friendliness levels were exceptional on this specific visit. The speed of food preparation was extraordinarily slow. The food was average, and priced high at this hotel location. The brownie sundae was extremely horrible tasting like plastic boxed brownies."
4,"An excellent library: wonderful selection, nicely laid out, with lots of light and room and comfy seating.  \n\nYou can order a lot of audio and ebooks online, order books from other branches, reserve items that are out, etc with the click of a few buttons. \n\nThey have a terrific young adult room (glassed in, no grown-ups allowed), and cool exhibits in a large space. \n\nEven the location is wonderful - lots of benches and trees nearby, for reading."
1,We had a very disappointing experience. After reading all these reviews I was looking forward to give this place a try. The pad thai was the worst we have ever had. I can't even describe the taste. The only good thing about our meal was the Thai ice tea and the sticky rice. It wasn't special but it was as good as you would expect it from any other Thai place.
4,"So, I typically go to the Sahara location but we tried their newest location on Russell. The food, as always was BLOODY AMAZING!!! I had the Black & Green burger, it was NOM NOM & it only got better with aioli's!! We also ordered all of their fries, sweet potato ones, truffle fries, salnt & pepper fries and the jalapeno fires, the latter are my FAVORITE!!\nBut here's the BEST part of our dining experience, the service! When we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. There were a total of 6 of us but only 2 of were there first. Carla seated us with a laugh & a smile! She also shared with us that her co-worker had called out 2 days in a row; yes, someone will be AXED from there! \nOnce the rest of our party arrived, Carla continued to be a ROCK STAR! She was on point. She was pleasant. She was funny. She was fun. She made us laugh. She was just FRICKIN AWESOME!! Not once being the ONLY Server on the floor did it hinder her work or her personality! \n\nTHANK YOU CARLA for an AWESOME time! And we WILL be back to see YOU!"
1,"I was excited to see a Filipino restaurant in Squirrel Hill, but the food was only okay to me. Still the option of eating Filipino food here is great :)"
3,"Zipp's Sports Grill is great! It's definitely \""bar food\"" but it's so yummy! Get one of the focaccias! The Monaco Focaccia is my favorite (with a side of their \""golden\"" wing sauce for dipping)! Service is good and it's the perfect place to come catch a game on TV!"
1,"We were invited to a pool party here. This is a locals hotel, very off strip, but tourists do stay here as well. The pool is very small, but intimate. The inside of the hotel is very dark and dismal, but has some very interesting art and mirrors on the ceiling. I would not return simply because it gave me a creepy feeling (as though I would be robbed, or something). It is what it is."
1,"Eh...\n\nPositives of the property are that you have full suites, a big pool area, and if you drive up to the top of the mtn, a great view.\n\nProblem is the place doesn't seem updated since the mid-eighties+and if you have small kids with you- then get ready for a hike up the mtn...to your hotel room.\n\nWhen checking in I asked the front desk clerk for directions to my room and for bell service for my luggage..\nHer reply:\""Follow this guy in the suburban\"" \nI never found \""this guy\""\n\nTapatio might be a good idea for couples on a weekend retreat that don't mind walking up and down hills to the lobby and/or swimming/restaurants in a tired 80's setting. \n\nI would probably spring the money to stay at the JW Marriott Desert Something or Other next time..."
1,"Good food (best cheese enchiladas), but please do something with all the flies I won't be back until then , customer for years but find it hard to come back as the flies attack me and my food ."
0,"Decided to come here for my wife's birthday dinner and we immediately remembered why we don't come here anymore. We waited for 1 hour before being seated, after being told the wait is 30 min and seeing a ton of people go in front of us who came in after. The service was terrible, one person in our party didn't get her food til 15 minutes after everyone else. And the food is way over priced, a burrito with 3 items in it is 15 and .75 for every additional item and 2 tacos are 13 for just meat and a side of beans and rice! The only bright spot for this place is the chips and salsa. Awesome chips and 2 salsas plus beans. All in all I will not be back just for the chips."
3,"Un incroyable petit caf\u00e9 dans le Vieux Montr\u00e9al!\nJe n'arrive pas \u00e0 croire que je n'avais pas encore r\u00e9dig\u00e9 mon avis sur Olive et Gourmando. \n\nExcellent granola, comptoir de p\u00e2tisseries \u00e0 se rouler par terre, succulents sandwichs, salades go\u00fbteuses : c'est ce que vous y trouverez. Les aliments sont toujours tr\u00e8s frais, sans oublier leur caf\u00e9 qui est sans aucun doute mon pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le coin. Disons que je ne suis pas triste de travailler tout pr\u00e8s ;) \n\nLes prix sont \"" normaux \"" pour le Vieux. Si vous prenez un repas complet (p. ex., sandwich, boisson et dessert), la facture montera assez vite... mais selon moi, \u00e7a en vaut la peine. Je ne suis jamais d\u00e9\u00e7ue par les plats d'Olive et Gourmando. Seul hic : l'endroit est extr\u00eamement achaland\u00e9, et ce, \u00e0 toute heure du jour. Si vous y allez en esp\u00e9rant prendre votre caf\u00e9 assis tranquille \u00e0 une table, vous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerez sans doute aller ailleurs. La place est toujours remplie et c'est assez bruyant. D'ailleurs, il y a souvent une file d'attente. Vous pourrez donner votre nom \u00e0 une gentille h\u00f4tesse qui vous fera signe d\u00e8s qu'une table sera libre."
0,"Man, this place sucks so much haha!  I had such a horrible experience.  I went in, and every customer is confused because they didn't know that they had to take a number to pay for things.  I waited a long time until I found out I had to take a number.  I was there for about fifteen minutes, all I wanted was a cookie.  I left.  No one asked if I needed help, no one greeted me, or said thanks for coming.  It was like no one cared.  Horrible customer service."
3,"BT's burgers are better than a ton of other burger joints...so I'm having a hard time understanding all the animosity.  Since I have only been here once...maybe they just got lucky?\n\nThat said, the inside of BT's has a laid back appeal to it.  The place is clean and well maintained.  I liked that you could see the cooks and everything was laid out in the open.\n\nI ordered my burger medium-well...and I got it medium-well.  The ingredients I added were scaled down to avoid a drippy mess, and my burger was juicy and flavorful.\n\nMy buddy and I also ordered a small order of fried pickles to share.  This is where BT's loses a star from me.  Five barely breaded pickle slices come out with a small carafe of ranch.  My buddy and I immediately looked at each other like...\""WHAT!\""  My buddy asked them to take them back and refund our money...no problem.\n\nThe kid who brought us our burgers came back with another batch of fried pickles...that had a little more care put into them...but still a tiny portion for over three dollars...and gave them to us on the house.  My friend told him not to worry about the refund.  I could tell the kid was originally annoyed to take the pickles back...but sorry, that's just part of the job.  Those pickles need some major work in terms of quality and quantity BT's!\n\nLastly, the buns could use some work.  Warm them, then grill em.  Aside from those couple small things...the portion size was nice, the taste was good, and the price...not super bad...but in comparison...I'd make like some of the other reviews and go to 5 Guys."
4,Excellent. I agree with the other reviewers; Best BBQ in the East Valley. I've tried them all and this place is legit.  I had a Brisket plate. The meat was well smoked and I didn't feel the need to drench it in sauce.  Selection of sauces was real good.  My favorite is the Sassy sauce. Will definitely be back soon.
0,"I tried to visit this store today but it was closed. When I asked a Von's employee why, they stated that the jamba Juice employee just didn't show up today. I usually go to Tropical Smoothie but have been trying to give this Jamba Juice location a chance for my business. I get a smoothie or wheatgrass shot every single day after the gym. This location has had poor service almost every time. Half the time the person working doesn't know how to make the wheatgrass. When I get a Matcha shot it is made different and placed in a different size cup almost every time. They have been late to open almost every time I have arrived at the posted opening hours. I would like to know from you why I should consider giving this company my business when they are going out of their way to chase me away?"
1,"Chino is one of those places that does not have amazing mexican or asian food but they have manged to make the fusion of the two work. The jade red chicken and jerk chicken are two of my favorites and the chili rellano is serviceable.  I think i will stay away though because about an hour after eating my wife got really sick, not blaming the food but i would rather not take any chances."
4,Whoohoo!  My favorite Theaters!    Love the Camelview and Fashion Square locations
3,"Can anyone say thin crust pizza...  \n\nEverything on the menu is great, but I'm addicted to the thin crust pizza.\n\nTap Beer is around 4 bucks a pint, so getting your drink on isn't to expensive either.\n\nMy only gripe, which illustrates how good this place is, is that it is packed every time I go there.  \n\nWord to the pizza cookie too... If you have the room, this will ensure a heart attack by mid evening."
1,"Come on now, advertised as all you can eat, then they hit you up for $6 for dessert. What a rip.  The meat was overcooked, and the salad bar wasn't as good as they advertised. Total disappointment.  Service was excellent."
1,"I can only really comment on the casino since that's where I spent my time. The smoke in there is really bad (turn on some ventilation) but they did have a couple $5 minimum tables which is where I play (not a big gambler). \n\n2 stars because they took my money, the place was too smokey and the dealers weren't really that nice (nor attractive), BUT they had decently clean bathrooms."
3,"I haven't been in 2 years but when I went, the food was unforgettable! I had macaroni & cheese, ribs, fish and more! I went with my family after the MLK parade and I was not disappointed. All of us at the table could not stop saying yum the whole time. The only down side is that it is faaaaaaaaaaaaar!"
2,"I love Dairy Queen and especially their chicken strips and fries. I get this almost every time I come, and am never disappointed. My one complaint is that every time I do, regardless of I just waited behind other customers in the drive thru, I am asked to drive to the front and wait for my food. Tonight I sat for a good 10 minutes and when I pulled up, I paid and immediately asked to pull to the front. The good thing is I know my food is fresh, but what bothers me is in that 10 minutes I waited behind two customers, my order hadn't even been started? I waited in the parking lot an additional 11 minutes before someone brought me my one order of chicken strips. Hopefully they improve this."
2,I don't get the hype.\n\nBean tacos- just okay.  Spinach enchiladas- just okay.  Chips and salsa- just okay. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
4,"Very friendly!! Great service!!  Comfortable waiting room to wait in for your car to be done.   It has massage chairs,  foot massagers, and internet . They have a punch card, and after your 8th wash with them you get a 20 dollar car wash for free!  It was my first time and the armor all'd my car for free!! My car came out spotless and it smelled great, even before I put my air freshener in it! My favorite part, when your car is ready you are not honked at or have to be on the look out for waving rags, they come and get you by name!! It is very professional.   I will definitely be back!!"
0,"We went for lunch. The appetizer was fantastic, but it rapidly went down from there. I had a turkey sandwich and I swear the bread was contractor grade. I mean seriously, if I were building a new house this stuff could be used to construct the foundation. I mentioned it to the waiter 3 (!!!) times and he still didn't offer anything to fix it. I finally had to say \""Hey, can't you do anything about this?\"" His \""manager\"" comp'd me a slice of cheesecake, whoop-dee-doo. The tab was over $100 for myself, wife, and our three kids. That free slice of cheesecake sure helped! Bottom line is, we will NOT be going back even if it's free!"
0,"I can put up with a lot of crap, mostly because I've discovered that Las Vegas is NOT a customer service town.  You disagree with me?  Well, then...I have two words for you.  Automatic Gratuity.  In my opinion, no matter what the size of the party, gratuity should not be an automatic thing, waitresses are paid a flat wage for what they do and whatever they make in tips is a reflection of their customer service skills.  Regardless, I'm MORE THAN willing to forgive less than stellar food or products if the customer service was good.  In fact, amazing customer service will probably prompt me to return to a location despite any issues I may have with food or drinks.  This is not the case with this location, and as the rude manager, Chris, informed me...I'll be the first negative Yelp that their location receives, despite the fact that, presently, the past Yelps are on my sidebar and I see two 2 star reviews already...without even looking further.  \n\nI went to this location with a work party on Friday night.  We had a pretty large group and were greeted by a waitress we had dealt with before, Emily.  Now, the first time we dealt with her, she made it a point to tell us that it was her first night there and while the service wasn't great, it was understandable with a new job.  In that time, her confidence must have skyrocketed because she was a bit belligerent on Friday night, but also seemed very much overwhelmed.\n\nAs she was placing down some of the food that had been ordered, my office manager approached her and said...\""Hi, when you're finished, I'd like to order another drink.\""  Seems like a normal bar request, right?  Apparently not as Emily barely spared her a glance and loudly replied, \""Ok, honey...well, I'm the only waitress on staff and you'll need to wait.\""  I'm sorry, to speak to a grown woman like she's a child and you're her parent, are you kidding me?!\n\nMy manager sat back down, looked at me and said...\""I'm ready to go, I won't be drinking anything else.\""  Sure enough, when Emily FINALLY came back to our table, my manager waved her off and muttered something about her customer service skills.  Actually, most of the night, my manager spoke to the members of her staff that had shown up about how rude Emily was or muttered straight to her about something that had further annoyed her.  To cap off our night with Emily, we took a tally when everyone was leaving.  A grand total of THREE ordered drinks never made it back to the people that had ordered.  A+, honey!\n\nIt was at this point that I pulled out my phone to start a Yelp about what had happened.  The only problem was, there's more than one PT's location down Hualapai, so when Emily came back, I asked her what the address was for our location.  She didn't know.  Furthermore, another waitress didn't know.\n\nWhen the manager finally showed up to confront my office manager about HER attitude, it ended with a verbal altercation where she stood up and said she was leaving.  I can only supposed that he NEEDED to get the last word in, so he told her...\""please do!\""  I'm unsure if he really cared, wanted to save face or just rub salt in the wound, but he then approached the remaining people in our party, shook hands and asked about their experience.  I approached him, explained that my manager was understandably pissed off, but that I was calm and willing to explain what had happened to put her in that state.  He not only seemed less than apologetic when I told him what Emily had said, but assured me that nobody had ever complained about her and that she worked at three locations.  \n\nFinally, I told him that two of his waitresses didn't even know the address and that they should be further trained.  Again, he reiterated that they worked at several PT's around the area and I replied that when I was 18, I had been employed at three jobs to get by and could have told anybody the addresses and phone numbers of each location.  He seemed to scoff a bit at my make believe world of actually knowing where you're employed and I asked him what would happen if somebody called to get the location?  He replied that his staff was trained to tell anybody that calls that the nearest crossroad was Flamingo/Hualapai...which is actually half a mile away from this location.  I replied to him that he should know that most GPS systems don't operate on crossroad instructions, but rather an actual address.\n\nOnce again, I'm unsure how I'm supposed to move on from this experience when this is clearly the only bar in Las Vegas.  Where else am I supposed to go to watch sports or get a drink or enjoy good food.  Wait, excuse me?  There's a Buffalo Wild Wings on the other side of Flamingo/Hualapai?  I won't smell like a cigarette factory when I leave there?  Emily and Chris don't work there?  Well, why didn't you say so before?!  Thank you for the memories, PT's, sorry I had to grace you with your first negative review."
4,"Loved how this new company took over the old Theater!! To me it still looks the same as buy the tickets outside and then go in to the concession stand. But, when you get your tickets from the box office they show you a screen and you pick your seats!!! We got adult matinee $8.50. Then you go in and they have Alcoholic beverages to the right and the normal popcorn etc on the left.  We got a large popcorn and large drink $13.50.\nWhen you go into the theater OMG.. the seats are amazing. Recliners with using a push button gets you all cozy and a little table for your snacks. The movie screen is huge!! Very clean inside and the Women's bathroom was too!!\nThey have a Galaxy rewards card that you sign up online and pick you card up at the box office and you gain points with each use and get free things and its free to sign up. Very similar to the Regal Cinema card.\nLoved this experience and we will be back."
4,"This is the best mechanic I've ever been to. We've been going to them for years, but my experience with them yesterday made me want to post a review finally. I would have always given them 5 stars, but their service yesterday just reminded me of how exceptional they are. They will never try to sell you something you don't need, they will tell you how long you can wait for a repair so you don't spend your money too soon, and they are ridiculously thorough. I dropped my car off over the weekend for 3 issues, and on Monday I had received at least 4 phone calls throughout the day giving me an update on the status of my car. \n\nThey're the best, they're good, they're friendly, and they're honest. Don't go anywhere else."
3,"A great place to play and drink cheap. $1Michelobs and very friendly service unless you are trying to short change them but come on people, be nice to the service workers, they work hard. Games don't have bad odds either, had some luck at the slots. Overall a great place on a budget, only downside is the murky atmosphere and the $2 hotdogs aren't good tasting. Ha ha"
2,"Probably my least favorite place to see a show in Charlotte but because of their connection with Live Nations, they get a lot of great shows so I have been here countless times.\n\nI know that Live Nations makes most of its profits off the ticket price but I can't help but thing if you sold beer for less than $9 - $12 that you'd sell a lot more beer. Also, coming from someone who doesnt like light beer, their selection is horrible. I personally wont buy more than 1 or 2 at that price.\n\nThe VIP area (which you pay more for) includes a private bar and bathroom. However, if you would like a seat, you have to pay more for that.\n\nThe place is very clean and nice. Sound system is decent. But the layout could be a lot better for a place that was designed to be a live music venue. \n\nIf I had the option of seeing a performer anywhere else I would."
1,"I was exited to try this place but it did not meet my hoped for expectations. If you are spoiled on good Southern BBQ then this probably isnt the place. I think Famous Daves Chain is better than this place.\n\nThe hole in the wall feel of thjs barn shack of a place in and industrial park had me thinking good thoughts. The wonderful smells when you walk in and the great menu choices if pulled pork, brisket, ribs, chicken, sandwiches or plates made me want to try several things. Unfortunately they didn't have a small combo plate to try 2 meats and veggies (they have one option for $19 which is too big for most lunches).   I went for the standard pulled pork sandwich and slaw and ordered a rib on the side. I got to try the fried okra and sweet fries my buddy ordered too. \n\nPositives - good sides options (okra, homemade slaw, sweet potato fries, cornbread).   Staff were very friendly and welcoming and helpful. \n\nSad items: pulled pork sandwich was drenched in sauce. I judge a sandwich by the tenderness of the pulled meat and smoky flavor and then add some sauce to balance for taste. This one had much sauce which is usually an indicator of hiding the real goodness of the pork.\n\nRibs - they were not tender baby backs but very fatty and not fall of the bone variety which I adore. Glad I didn't get a whole rack here. \n\nMy friend who got the rib tips platter wasn't too happy either. We wouldn't say it was bad tasting, just not great BBQ."
2,"An A-OK show to catch in Vegas, especially when the tickets go for $55 a pop. Granted it's not the closet seat, but the stage is small anyway. \n\nIt's a very acrobatic show with lots of twists, turns, flips, and more. And it's also very funny! They have a few characters on the show that are just there for extra comedy, so it's not all serious stunts. \n\nDefinitely entertaining and worthwhile... but only if the tickets are on sale."
1,"Cheap, quick, but if you are looking for tasteful food it's not the right place. In fact, the 2 stars represent the value per dollars of the food. 4 stars for this place is insane. AZ people - you know better Mex food!"
1,"This restaurant is very nice on the inside but the Mexican food is definitely not the best I've had.  I don't think I would call this place bad, but there is nothing special or desirable about it.  I would avoid weekends because it gets busy and the food is not as good."
1,"What a mess!\n\nShowed up here on a Thursday night starving to see a line practically out the door. As we were waiting to get a table people a few ahead of us were told that they were closing. We looked at our watches and it was about 10 until 9 and they said they closed at 9. You might want to close when you say and not earlier because it almost caused a riot. \n\nWe decided to sit at the bar instead of waiting for the bottom to fall out of the mess at the front. Sat down and the bartender was pretty quick and really personable. He was the best part about this whole place. \n\nFirst let me say that this place is terrible. I went to their website and it was voted 'Best of' for several things that were totally NOT best of anything. Worst of, yes. Best of, stop using that phrase with this restaurant. Does not go.\n\nFirst up was chips and salsa. The salsa really was actually right on. It was fresh and had a nice kick to it, but the chips? They must of run out of their 'best of' chips because these tasted like stale Tostitos. Oh man, stale Tostitos would have been an improvement, actually. \n\nWe then ordered the spicy queso bean dip and instantly regretted it. It was so bland and so un-queso-y that we pushed it away and waited for our entrees. \n\nI ordered vegetable fajitas which you THINK you couldn't mess up. Oh, guess what? Yeah. My friend ordered some shrimp dish that I refused to try so I'm not sure if it was good or not. \n\nI wouldn't eat here again unless the world was wiped out by an atomic bomb and only because the food here would survive."
1,"I really like the Vibe in this place.  They have a nice seating area with solo seats and booths with a ton of tv's to watch every game on tv.\n\nI was told they have good sliders, but i opted for the beer battered chicken fingers and fries.  The fries were good. They had some kind of cajun seasoning or something on them. But the chicken fingers, although tasty, were very very greasy.  I went with 3 others and they were all satisfied with their food.\n\nThe service here was terrible. Not that anyone was nasty, they were just very understaffed. There was one waitress practically waiting on the entire section by herself. Someone (maybe a bartender?) was trying to help her out. he said there was a late party the night before so they didnt schedule a lot of people to be there for lunch.  I'm not sure if that was actually true or not. Either way they should have had more people on staff. It took forever for us to get our table cleaned and to get menus, and we had to ask for things a few times before we got them. at one point they brought over 2 pbr's instead of 2 bud lights. and then we had to ask a few times to get the right beers. they told us we could keep the pbr's, but we didnt want them.\n\nI probably would go back if everyone else wanted to and try the sliders. But if the service is as bad again I might get impatient and leave before they make it to my table."
2,"They're having a Back to School Sale, but they don't carry kids shoes? Their selection of women's shoes is impressive but the prices aren't really that discounted."
2,"Let it be known that this is the first and only piano bar that I have been to.  My friends and I ended up here after dinner because Yardhouse was packed.  Unlike other reviews have mentioned, I wasn't charged a cover fee to get in.  \n\nThe star of the bar are the two pianos sitting across from each other, where each pianist has their own tip jar.  During the first part of the night, the tip jars weren't really utilized; the duo performing sang popular songs, had people get up and dance, and encouraged audience participation through singing as well.  \n\nThe second half of the night was much more entertaining, with a \""rock\"" pianist playing against a \""country\"" guy.  They each played a portion of a song from their respective genre, with the audience throwing tips at the side that they wanted to hear.  At first it was funny, but then it went on long enough to turn into tip gouging from the audience.  After that bit they played jingles based on dirty jokes, with audience members offering their own.\n\nOne thing I liked about Pete's is that there are two bars, one on either side of the building.  It's nice to have a bar nearby without having to walk through the entire venue to get a drink.\n\nBased on how much better the second pair of performers were, your entertainment for the evening really depends on who is playing.  If the first pair kept performing, I probably wouldn't want to come back here.  With that kind of difference in entertainment, Pete's is just A-OK."
4,"Hands down my favorite restaurant!  Food was so good I even took pictures of the menu so I would not waste any time upon entering the restaurant.  An absolute must try is the Pear and Gorgonzola flat bread.  The wait staff are awesome and really seem to enjoy being there. The manager Craig is superb and his demeanor for his establishment really shines through his personality.  All in all if I were a multi-millionaire I would put this establishment in my home like Richie Rich!  But, I am not, yet, so I will simply drive the 3 miles to dine in.  It is worth it!"
4,"If you're an artsy fartsy type of dude or chick then you will love First Friday's...\n\nThere's a little something for the artist in every one. Say you have little ones, the Children's Museum has free admission though it can get crazy crowded! Get there early. If you're a science geek then you should check out the monthly ANO at the Science Center. If you love visual art you should walk into some of the galleries along Roosevelt, including Monorchid and Modified. The Phoenix Art Museum is also free on the first Friday of every month. If music is your thing then you will love the street performances by local musicians of all kinds. Be sure to stop over and see who is playing at a Crescent Ballroom, another favourite venue of mine. If you want great craft beer to loosen you up before you tackle the first Friday crowd then stop in at the Leaf. They've opened up a beer garden in back just for you! You could also try Angels Trumpet Ale House. You might be hungry and tired after all that exploring downtown so stop at Carly's Bistro and grab a greek salad and more beer! Or if sushi is more your thing try Mido! Both places are open late. \n\nParking can be a mother. Ride your bike or take the rail if you have the option. \n\nFind life downtown again!"
4,"CHAMPAGENE BRUNCH! Need I say more? I could not believe they were only charging 30 dollars for champagne brunch. I don't know how many mimosas I drank but I can tell you I left feeling elated. This buffet is not super fancy smanshy like the Bellagio BUT the food is good and the service is excellent. The divided the buffet into regions American food, Asian food, etc. I ate so many crab legs dipped in melted butter. Think about it right now is making me hungry. I  completely forgot my waitresses name but she was SWEETHEART we fell in love with her. She constantly checked up on us and made sure our glasses were full, table was cleared, and we had enough napkins. She definitely exceeded my expectation in regards to customer service at buffet. Her name tag said Manila she was from the Philippines."
2,"Met a friend here yesterday for some drinks/apps.  Sat outside since it was so nice out. Started out with a bloody mary.  They were good and I'm assuming there was vodka in mine, although you could not taste it.\n\nMy friend got the calamari and I decided to splurge and get the Lobster Nachos.  The calarmari looked good but had no taste what so ever.  The nachos cost $14 and were approx 10 single chips with a small little bite of lobster and some sauce drizzled on it.  I'm not sure what I was expecting but for $14 I thought I'd get more then 10 small chips.  Guess I should have went for the all you can eat crablegs instead.\n\nService was good, our waitress checked on us often."
2,"We were taken here by a couple of locals (I guess we're locals now too though) on Wednesday night and fun was had.  It's got a busy, friendly vibe and overall satisfying food.\n\nThe good: to contradict a previous reviewer, I found the beer selection to be quite respectable.  You've got mainstream goat piss, mainstream Irish, beer snob local, national and international.  I was very pleased by the Gaelic ale from Asheville.  Very pleased.  Also, the nachos were truly a work of art.  I can't stand flour tortillas but flour tortilla chips are great for this mouthwatering mountain of peppers, beans, tomatoes, olives, cream and little chicken bits.\n\nThe ok: well, I found my pasta - the Honey Chicken - to be just ok.  The chicken itself was nice and juicy.  I don't know what I expected from the pasta.  I think it was overall a bit sweet, and perhaps a nice pungent feta topping would have broken that up a bit better. What it came with was a bland kind of Parmesan, I think.\n\nI might return and try something else on the menu - like their massive 1/2 pound burgers - and we'll see if it'll make me a fangirl."
3,Wonderful place. Will definitely be back for more when I am in the area.
4,"One of my top sushi spots in the Phoenix area. Great service and reasonable prices. The baked scallop roll is a meal in itself and needs to be shared.  I have always had amazing service at all the valley locations.  I can't remember ever having a single issue with the food, service or ambiance!  One of my all time favorite places!"
3,This place is pretty good! they serve a selection of creatively topped dogs and some of the best greasy fries I have had in awhile. enough said!  Time to go drink some beer and devour this dog!
3,"I have stayed here countless times because my mom is actually one of those VIPs but I have to tell you the reason why I love the FLAMINGO is because they have....\n\nLORD OF THE RINGS penny slot machine! \n\nIf you haven't played, it is so much fun and you can actually make some moola after putting in your $20.  Oh yeah, the sound effects are awesome, fun and it is so interesting!\n\nIt is located close to the hotel registration lobby."
3,We haven't been in a while. I had the fish and chips. Mostly for the fish and not the French fries. The fish was so crunchy and the tarter sauce has some spice to it now which is a yummy surprise. I would definitely recommend the fish for sure!
1,"The people who run (own?) this restaurant are sweet and kind.  Do not try the spaghetti.  I don't think they are experienced at eating it...let alone preparing it.  One receives about 1/3 the necessary sauce.  The meatballs?  They may have been small \""balls\"" at one time, but they are cut into hard pieces of unidentifiable meat.  The location is great and a well-established local pizza store was there for decades.  I wish a restaurant expert would befriend these owners and give them a few tips on service and some new recipes.  I'm sad for them."
3,"Best brunch by far in Northwest Glendale. Always searching for a good spot in this area and found this one. Staff was great, food was good. Like the atmosphere . Plan on trying them for wine tasting And dinner soon"
1,"I live in San Francisco with lots of REAL authentic vietnamese restaurants. This place was NOT acceptable. At the least, it didnt even had a \""french\"" taste to it.. It taste like a beginner trying to imitate the beef broth. And for the price... NOT worth it. AND the white waitress tried to pronouce \""bun thit nuong\"". I almost died in laughter."
2,"On the way home from a trip out of town, I ordered to-go at this location.\n The lady at the to-go station was very friendly and the restaurant offered free peach tea while we waited for our order, so that was very nice. \nHowever, they messed up my food order, which we only discovered after leaving the restaurant and arriving home. :(  It was very disappointing. \nNext time, I will check my order before leaving."
3,"Yes it carries a $59 price tag but it's definitely an experience worth partaking once in Las Vegas. This is not your typical brunch buffet. You can get those at the World of Buffets for unlimited breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is an experience. \n\nIt really breaks down to what do you value for your money. Is it food alone or can ambiance be a deciding factor. For me, it's the whole experience. I enjoy buffets. I enjoy making a reservation. I enjoy being seated on time for my reservation. I enjoy the extra attention from the wait staff. I enjoy the option of ordering off a menu during my buffet. I enjoy live music and great customer service. And finally, I enjoy scrumptious food. \n\nSo why only 4 stars? Not much variety for the buffet. Just Prawns. Large large prawns."
2,"We have eaten at the Wicked Spoon two times now.  We decided to do this one because our 4 & 2 year old kids are free.  The first time we had the breakfast buffet on a Sunday.  It was OK, nothing that really stood out to us.  \n\nLast night we tried the dinner buffet hoping our meal would be better and we could finally understand the hype about this buffet...there were several selections like Chinese, Mac and cheese station, meats, salads, gourmet cheeses, tons of dessert options, pizza, and several other things.  The best thing I had was the shepherds pie.  The worst was the lamb Indian dish which had small chunks of fatty lamb.  I would take a bite then had to spit it out and chew around the fat.  My husband found a long black hair in his food.  The server offered him a free drink to make up for it.  \n\nIn my opinion the best part was the dessert station.  All of the desserts were very good and huge selection.\n\nNext time I think we will try the Bellagio or Caesars Palace buffet."
4,"Came here with my wife for a getaway from LA.\n\nFood 5/5\nAmbiance 5/5\nService 5/5\n\nMy friends and family thought its weird that I like this particular restaurant so much, but I really do!\n\nThere is nothing like overlooking the fountains of Bellagio and having a romantic meal with the woman I love. Made me feel like a millionaire (although I'm not ... yet).\n\nWill definitely be back!"
0,This is not a BBQ joint.  The hotlink sandwich tasted like a Bar S hotdog w/peppers.   The brisket I know had to be a day old & I am not talking about yesterday.   Don't waste your time.  I spent $15 for food that I just threw away.
0,"I came into this place one evening with the intention to check out the atmosphere and pricing. \nAs I walked in , the front desk guy is chatting with one of the girl members there. I waited patiently as I was looking around hoping another trainer or worker might acknowledge me. After 10 minutes of standing there like an idiot looking at brochures and signs, I came up and tried to get the guy's attention. The front desk guy just finish talking to the female member and finally asked me what I needed. I got my pricing , no promotion or other options was offered by the guy so I left disappointing.\nOverall- atmosphere looks like a hookah lounge , very dimly lit. \nService from the front desk was horrible, they act like they didn't want your business."
2,"Great happening atmosphere! \n\nOrdered the black and Bleu cooked medium, but it was still dry. I wonder how it would be if I had ordered well done?!\n\nThe tilted Buffalo flathead was pretty good. I especially liked the celery bits that were in it. \n\nAll in all, it was an average experience. I have no reason to run back here."
3,I live down the street and have been here several times now. The tortilla shells are warm and fresh and the salsa is really fantastic! \n\nHere's the problem: there's WAY to much 'sauce' confined within the meat. By sauce I'm referring what the meat is cooked in. A couple times it seemed like I was eating a taco that had just sauce in it!
1,"My fave food: Som Tum Thai (Green Papaya Salad) with beef jerky and sticky rice. I love the green papaya salad and beef jerky, but always put the sticky rice aside (and my husband usually eats it, lol). Score: 3.5/5\nFoods to avoid: fried rice (oily, tasted like Maggie soy sauce/fish sauce, score: 1/5). Different curry dishes. I have tried the chicken red curry, panaeng curry, and pork green cury; none of them were very satisfying (score: 1/5).\nI actually felt bad for this place, but I have been going to this place so many times because of its convenient location on State Street. What can I say, I am just not a fan.."
4,"Great place to eat. My wife and I have been here twice with our daughter, who has three visits as a result...lucky girl. We have never had to wait and our last visit together was perfect to \""wait\"" for the start time for a movie we wanted to see on a rainy day. The portabella mushroom (Bankok Steak Fries) appetizer is great and our daughter, who is not a big fan of mushrooms, likes these. My wife and daughter have created their burgers each time. They have gotten shakes both times and I got one this last visit...it was one named after the Samoas\u00ae girl scout cookie and was very good. I have ordered MORTY'S STEAKHOUSE burger both times and enjoyed it both times. Sha got the smores shake this time and it was great. The large marshmallow on top could used as a pillow ;). We all look forward to our next visit."
0,"Went this evening. Unremarkable. Weak margaritas, fajitas had chicken and beef, a bit of onions and one slice of green pepper and one slice of red pepper. This all cost $50. Service was good. Note no handrail on entrance stairs dangerous when wet. Won't go back and won't recommend."
4,"First night back in Las Vegas and we hear of a FREE open bar.  You know I was there.  \n\nGreat location, right on Fremont St in Downtown Las Vegas. The decor is amazing. Arcade machines, Video games, TVs above the bar for video game playing, lounge couches, live DJ, and excellent bar service.  You can't go wrong here.  \n\nThe bar and their bathroom is kept relatively clean.  I would definitely be back on my next trip."
2,"This is an update from a previous 8/5/14 review.  Following my post, the General Manager of Jaleo contacted me, apologized, and thanked us for the feedback.  He inquired into the details of the dietary restrictions and service staff.  He was extremely helpful in remediation and encouraged us to join them again on our next visit; given my group's positive experiences prior to this most recent visit, this will most likely occur!  Thanks Jaleo!"
1,"It's been a year since I was here? It's really been that long? Sadly, I'm keeping my rating the same. A whole year & it's still not vibing with me well.\n\nEnded up here on a Wednesday around 11pm.\n\nWe couldn't order food. Nothing. Zip. Nada. The kitchen was closed. It's only 11 & we came over here because The Vigs have great late night food. Lame\nThe bar had people at it so we cozied up by the fire. Romantic.\nThe server was really nice.\nThe music mix was great. Music is a big deal for me.\nThe drinks were watered down. BAD BAD BAD! Why would a bartender serve cocktails in a pint glass & water them down?! Yuck!\n\nBoth times I've been here they can't get the drinks right. I might never go back for drinks."
2,"This is the first time I have eaten in.  Previously I had some else pick me up take out.  AT $6.25 for lunch it is an excellent value.  At $6.55 for take out lunch it is even more of a value.  Picture mashing down on your suitcase to get the lid to close and you will have an idea of how much food you get in your take out box, they actually do mound it up and then force the lid down.  Two hungry adults would do well to finish it.\n\nI was in a vegetable mood so I started off with salad (fresh iceburg with dressing) a slightly spicy cole slaw, jello and a bowl of egg drop soup. I had a variety of meats and vegetables on my next two trips.  Nothing really stood out and several items seemed overcooked although nothing was bad enough I left any on my plate.  My favorites were the orange chicken, beef with broccoli and the egg roll.  Dessert is vanilla soft serve, with or without Hersheys syrup.\n\nThe place is kept clean.  It wasn't too busy in the dining room but there was also a steady stream of take out customers.  They kept drinks full and plates cleared pretty quick. The parking lot was over 1/2 full when I left just before noon.  This place has a steady following of customers."
1,"I went here to get some quotes on printing. They have a ton of trash scattered everywhere from cig butts to flyers outside. The main reason I'm turned off is when the guy gave me their business card, he had to scratch off an email address to write a new one..... Isn't this a printing business that sells and creates business cards...? Strange."
4,This place is perfect for lunch or dinner. We have had a few company lunches here and I have also gone here with friends.  They give you lots of food and it is always fresh!  The hummus is amazing and be sure to go for happy hour in the evenings as it is great prices on all their appetizers.  Their salads are large as well and will fill you up so be careful :)
1,"The food was excellent, however it's hard to eat with no silverware, which we had to get ourselves.  But after waiting for over an hour, anything would have tasted good, I guess. Also, it's serve your own drinks, which we figured out after 15 minutes on our own. Maybe they should have mentioned that when we were seated?  All that being said, the food WAS good.  It might be a while before we go back...."
0,"Filthy, beyond rude. So bad that we refused to even eat there and walked right out. This place does not deserve to be a Montreal restaurant. If you don't believe me, use their outside, next door, upstairs bathroom and decide for yourself."
3,"Great stay. Great staff. Clean rooms, ample parking, well appointed suite style rooms that felt spacious. Perfect stay for out of town business and meeting with clients.\n\nWould come back."
2,"In terms of a doctor's office Allergy Associates provides a great patient experience. The staff at Allergy Associates are willing to assist and depending on the day are usually easy to interact with. \n\nThe reason behind my regular visits to Allergy Associates stems to my asthma coming back with a vengeance after it lay dormant for a few years then the good ol Phoenix allergy seasons brought it back. Anywho, my doctor, Dr. Saavedra is a good man who is accessible to his patients. He's caring, attentive, and inquisitive which is important in his practice. Overall my experience with Dr. Saavedra and Allergy Associates is that it's a good medical office that is able to meet a person's needs in terms of allergies."
3,"Amy's Cafe is an excellent spot for lunch.  In college I lived across the street and had to stop there every other day.  Soup, salad and baguette is my favorite.  Their greek salads are excellent, the brocolli cheese soup very good, and who doesn't love baguettes.  Try the soup in a bread bowl as well.  Perfect spot for a light lunch.  Biggest drawback however, is the unbalanced tables outside and the size inside.  It's very compact, and if you're not careful when sitting outside you could lose your drink to the shaky tables that lean down the slight hill."
3,"Drop in here with a Groupon with the family in tow.  Really surprised by the quality and taste associated with the burger i got (BBQ, Bacon & Cheddar \""smash\"" sized burger on a wheat bun, with a side of fried pickles).  all in all, i was initially a little unimpressed, until the freshness of the ingredients and the quality of the preparation hit me with the first bite.  \nFirst of all, although not the most massive burger on their menu, it was filling without leaving me feeling stuffed sick (as can be common with other comparable burger joints - firve guys, in and out, fatburger, etc).\nthe kids loved the kids cheese burgers (no real surprise there), and aside from too much bun on their burgers, their meals were also a hit.  wife got an arizona burger, which while not for me, was a hit for her.  will definitely return and the fried pickles were also great, if you like pickles."
0,"::sigh::  \n\nWhy am I not surprised the owner would comment on my review, not take responsibility for his store's horrible service, blame it on me or my dog, accuse me of lying and ask me to take my review down?  Oh, that's right, because that's how he responds to all the negative reviews here.  \n\nCarl, if you indeed have a surveillance video with sound, then I'm sure you saw and heard me talking to your employee about going back with my dog.  She said, \""we actually prefer owners to come back if their dogs are difficult.\""  My dogs (both of them) were on the groomers table attached to the lead.  Neither of them were in my arms, as you stated. \n\nThe groomer that yelled at my dog, actually said, \""that dog nipped me.\""  But I'm sure, since you have sound, you heard that.  There was one drop of blood.  One.  No teeth marks.  Certainly not a bite.  But unfortunate for all involved.\n\nAnd the vet - yes, my vet does take my dogs back without me when they get their nails trimmed.  I'm not sure what your point is.  \n\nMy point was, and still is, that MY experience and MY DOGS experience at Bark Place Grooming was AWFUL.  And as another reviewer pointed out, that's what Yelp reviews are - experiences, thoughts and opinions of individuals who are/were customers of your business.  So no, I will not remove my review.  I'm sorry you don't see negative reviews as an opportunity to train your employees and make your business better.  As someone checking out the reviews here, I wouldn't take my dogs to your shop based SOLELY on your responses to negative reviews.  They are very telling.\n\nStill less than 1 star.  Still never going back.  Still wouldn't recommend to anyone."
1,"I write this review as both a big Elvis fan and a big Cirque Du Soleil fan.  There are very few songs Elvis sung that I have not heard, and I have seen all the Las Vegas Cirque Du Soleil shows and one of its traveling shows (Varekai).\n\nViva Elvis' problem is that it's only slightly more off-beat than the usual Vegas show:  it has singing, dancing, fancy costumes, hot-looking performers, etc. but every Vegas show has all that.  I expect Cirque Du Soleil show to have mind-bendingly creative costuming, great feats of strength and/or flexibility and/or daring, and far-out stage-set design.  Viva Elvis only has a little bit of each.\n\nI really enjoyed the music: the arrangements, the vocals, the instrumentals.  It's definitely one of the show's bright spots.  I don't understand why people complain about the music being sullied.  If I wanted original, I'd have stayed home and listened to my Elvis LPs.  The singers kicked ass, as did the band.  A heavy metal rendition of one of the Elvis standards positively rocked with its chest-pounding bass.\n\nAmong the performances, I really enjoyed the \""giant guitar\"" set, though I can see how people might not like it much.  My enjoyment came from how difficult the moves are.  Those two guys are amazingly strong and fit.  I felt tired just watching them.  I kept waiting for them to show signs of fatigue but they never did.  However, their moves could have been a bit less athletic and more imaginative.\n\nThe \""superhero\"" segment, combining a triple trampoline (not new) with a \""parkour\"" set-up (trendy!) is creative and enjoyable.  Some of the moves take tremendous strength and skill, as well as lots and lots of practice.\n\nThe rest of the show was just so-so.\n\nStarting the the stage sets: they're 100% confined to the stage and its airspace.  There is not ONE single performer out among the audience or above the audience as in the other CdS shows.  It's as if they're trying to keep the cost down.\n\nThe costuming is highly disappointing, mostly run-of-the-mill, missing the usual CdS wildly imaginative combinations of shapes, colors, and concepts.  (A note: in the final number, I think ALL performers, male and female, appear on stage in Elvis jumpsuit, all differing in color and embellishments.  I don't remember for sure, that I *think* nobody was in showgirl costume.)\n\nPerformance-wise, the \""Jailhouse Rock\"" set has potential, with a \""upside down\"" segment, which they don't exploit enough and that's a shame because it's one of the more unusual and imaginative features; the \""cowboys twirling ropes\"" is so pedestrian it has me wondering _WHY_ CdS would think that such an act would wow the audience;  the \""military\"" dance number is kinda cool, but really not much different than a \""Stomp\"" or \""Riverdance\"" number.\n\nAs my S.O. said, if the show was not comp-ed and we had to pay for the tickets, she'd have been very unhappy!"
4,"I have, since writing the original review of this place, tried many Thai restaurants including another Archi's. Archi's has been cemented as my favorite Thai place so far. \n\nThe real meat of this update is as follows.\n\nI was pondering ordering an 8 or 9 spiciness the next time I came here according to my last review. I have long since discovered that if you convince them you really want it spicy, you just order a number higher than 10. Turns out they have a secret spiciness scale that goes up to 30.\n\nBe warned! The Archi's in Summerlin will give me a 30-spicy dish that is edible and delicious. This Archi's I can not eat past a 20. A 25 was ridiculous. I dare not venture to 30. However, if you are a fan of spicy food this will definitely get you what you're looking for."
4,"Ambiance: Stylish, sleek, authentic\nFood: fresh seafood, melts in the mouth\nPresentation: fabulous\nService: very attentive and knowledgeable\nPrice: high but reasonable for what you get\n\nThe three of us (my dad, my husband and myself) had miso soups, a garden salad to share,  2 sets of sushi rolls (we had to go for a second of the baked crab roll -  sooo good), octopus sushi,  2 plates of Chef's Sashimi combination, and a carafe of sake.  Oh, and don't forget to go for their deserts!!  We had mochi (strawberry, espresso and mango). Espresso was by all means our favorite. Very rich in flavor and don't be surprised if you leave your plates crystal clean :) \n\nFor our dinner, we paid close to $270 (with tips, taxes). High, but something worth the experience.\n\nBon appetite.\nUlyana"
1,"Ummm, can I have a little Mexican food with my salt? \n\nHoly crap! This food is over salted and waaaaaay over seasoned. I went here and ordered a veggie bowl thingy and I did not like it at all. The peppers and onions (fajitas) were way over cooked and tasted like they were sitting there all day. The guac was bland and over salted, and the lettuce wasn't crunchy. The food was luke warm and really not impressive at all. \n\nI will say, their chips are really good. Maybe get nachos or something?"
0,"Teachers are great.  Principal and leadership are terrible.  The PTA was recently forced out by the current leadership.  They simply want nothing to do with parents or any involvement from parents unless they have complete control.  \n\nOt's a pity as the teachers are very good here, my son loves them.  But the leadership ranks about as low as I have ever seen in an school."
1,"Clean fast food restaurant but the food was horrible tasting and looking. The containers that held the food wasn't covered. So the variety of meat, beans and other toppings looked as if it hasn't been refilled, reheated, or at least stirred before we reached the counters.\n\nI ordered three grilled chicken tacos and the tortillas were cold. Only had a nibble of chicken on the tacos so it would pretty much be a veggie taco lol.\n\nStaff was ok, restaurant was very cool but I've definitely experienced better."
0,"Goldies has always been a staple for sand volleyball players from Scottsdale Ranch Park to go to after games.  I am not sure what has happened but for the last few month, the service and attitudes of the servers and managers has been flat out awful.  After rude and incompetent service in back to back nights, I think we are heading to Versus Sports Grill from here on out"
1,"Roadrunner is usually a cool place. Last time I was there the bartender was too busy talking to his buddies to check on us. To top it off a Blue Moon is $6.75. Now I am not a cheap person but when a drink is just about more if not more money than an appetizer then there is a problem. I know it's not a domestic beer but seriously? An off the strip local bar charging $6.75 for a pint of beer is insane. To top it off I asked the bartender if they had any late night (midnight) drink specials and he said they have a Coors Light special, pints are $3.00, however they are out of Coors Light. You'd think he would have been able to substitute or something. I'm just saying, it's a crap economy and they aren't doing shit. Come on! Help a brotha out! Unemployed poor people want to drink too!!"
3,"My sister and I went to Salty's for Cinco de Mayo. We actually had a great time! The place has a lot of open space, I love how it's like a big backyard party with all the amenities! The food was simple, but totally tasty (chicken burrito). Service was pretty good. We were lucky we got there early because there was a huge line later in the evening and they were only letting people in as people left. I would have personally never waited that long to get in. Margaritas were cheap and gave the typical heart burn from the pre-made mix, but we had a good time!"
4,"This is a review about their Sunday brunch.\n\n$58 for brunch?  Yeah.  It's expensive.  I felt guilty spending that kind of money on brunch especially since I'm not wealthy, but let me tell you... it's worth it.\n\nOk, let me justify it.  For a decent brunch in Vegas, I normally spend about $30.  In Vegas, I'm not looking to eat at Denny's and try to get away with brunch for $10.  $30 is about right for a nice, fun place with decent food for brunch.  Couple that with the fact that I ate so much I barely ate a snack for dinner.  So I saved the cost of dinner, which I would have spent another $30-$40.  Now, add in the elegant and luxurious ambience at Jasmine, sitting next to the Bellagio fountains, and the price isn't so bad!\n\nNow that we've got the sticker shock out of the way, I have to say this is one of the top things you must try in Vegas before you die.  Or maybe I should say, this is one of the top things you must try in Vegas before they get wise to it and raise the price.\n\nSo what makes this place so damn good?  Let's start with the Peking Duck.  I am from Hong Kong and I know a good Peking Duck, and this was totally legit.  Crispy skin, they sliced it thin so you only got the skin, not the fat, and not the meat.  The bun that goes with it?  Superb.  Soft, light, and fluffy.  Even Peking Duck at some of the nicer restaurants in Monterey Park can't compete.  I can sit there and eat just that all day.\n\nPoached shrimp cocktail... Gigantic, meaty and delicious.\n\nThey had poke style tuna in a little waffle cone made with squid ink.  That was fabulous.  Similarly, they had a beef tatare in a spinach waffle cone.  That wasn't as good, but still pretty tasty.\n\nSmoked salmon was excellent.\n\nThey had dim sum (har-gow and shu-mai).  Not the best dim sum I've had, but pretty good.  I would say better than the dim sum found at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's.\n\nSo many of the items there were delicious, i can't go through them item by item.  Let's just say I was very impressed by most of the things there.\n\nWith that said, there are some things to avoid:\n\n1. The asian noodle soup station.  I love noodles.  I will never turn down noodles.  But at the noodle station you have a choice of maifun (rice noodles) or egg noodles served with chicken stock.  You can add fish balls, fish cakes, and vegetables in it.  The soup was bland.  The noodles were bland.  Just did not hit the spot.\n\n2. Lobster Eggs Benedict.  What's not to love?  Eggs Benedict with Lobster.  Well, it's a poached egg (which was prepared beautifully), sitting on top of a potato cake with tiny bits of lobster in it.  And that potato cake was not good at all.  Mushy, bland, and overall yucky.  The egg on top was delicious though.\n\n3. Mochi ice cream.  This was absolutely disgusting.  The mochi was hard and waxy.  Even frozen supermarket packaged mochi is superior.  Ever had one of those single-serve mozzarella cheese snacks that come in a little waxy package that you peel away to reveal the cheese inside?  Yeah, that's what this felt like.  Break open the mochi shell and just scrape out the ice cream.\n\nThere were so many things to try, and even though there were some misses, most of them were hits.  58 bucks is a lot of money to spend (by the way, drinks are not included in the price, so be prepared to spend more than that).  So this is definitely a luxury and a splurge, but completely worth it."

I don't hesitate to recommend Chandler Dental Excellence to anyone.  I take my kids and husband there, also.  My 5 year old feels right at home.  I will not go anyplace else!"

2,"ronde is mostly a funky bicycle shop with slick, smart and intelligently designed bicycles and bicycle gear. but it's also a cafe and art gallery.you can take a seat at one of handful of cute vintage 50s-ish tables and have coffee and sweet, cake type things.the space has been furnished and designed thoughtfully and contains lots of really nice goods that you'd like to take home. the coffee is well made by friendly people. soft milk, not too hot, rounded flavour. trusty partner very much enjoyed the espresso. my flat white was a wee bit weak but we'll be back."
1,"My trip out here was actually quite a let down. It was a Sunday morning and we had no plans and wanted to do something a little different so after seeing a commerical with the sparkling waters and the awesome looking shopping and dining it looked like we had found our Sunday afternoon destination. \n\nWe loaded up the car and began out 35 minute drive out there to first drive by a completely dead golf course on the way in, which we let go since we had not made the trip out there to golf. Following the signs it led us to the casino parking garage and we thought we had made it to this awesome desert oasis. \n\nThis is when things went south, It is very unfortunate because this could be a great place but walking through the shopping area was like watching disney's Cars when they all freak out because they have customers coming down the street. It really felt that way, Most of the buildings are vacant and the few that were not had the shop owners/keepers sitting out front basically asking you to come inside and look around. It was more of the PLEEEAAASSSEEE come in, not a hey, how is your afternoon come take a look. \n\nI did feel a little dooped into coming out there, the TV commercial that aired showed this amazing lively happening place to go and that could not have been further from the truth. Unfortunately I have to say I don't think I will be back."
3,"Another convenient location!  This time, they moved into the bottom floor of the Ogden in downtown Las Vegas!!  My company is moving downtown in September and it's nice to know there's a Rachel's Kitchen around the corner.  On this visit, me and my work team came for a quick lunch before our quarterly company meeting.  \n\nI love the look of this restaurant.  No matter which location, you will be treated to a nice, clean bistro style restaurant.  This location has little round tables and high bar tops lining the front window.  The front counter is truly the star of the show, has a huge menu for your convenience and a viewing window for pastries.  The staff is friendly and very attentive.  You order, pay, grab your number and find a seat.  Your food will be brought to you when it's ready!  Super convenient :)\n\nFor lunch, I got the same gourmet sandwich I get in every visit:  The turkey club on wheat bread.  Smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and mayo served on three slices of your bread choice.  For me, what makes this sandwich is the avocado and mayo.  I love a sandwich with both.  It ties it all together and because of that, it's the best for me.  The turkey is nicely smoked, they give you a lot of slices and makes this sandwich super flavorful.  For my drink, I always get the Wilshire Smoothie.  It's filled with peaches, bananas, pineapples, fresh squeezed orange juice and nonfat vanilla frozen yogurt.  I always add kale to it for my serving of a super food.  Such a great smoothie, blended with all my favorites!!  Definitely a must try.  \n\nOverall, a great bistro place!  Remember, on Sundays, mimosas are only $3.  I hope my review has enticed you to visit.  If you're looking for clean food with great service, come check them out.  You will not be disappointed!"
0,"I have not sat down to eat here, I have always got it to go. The food here is just bland. How people give it four stars just blows my mind. The food seemed like it was sitting around for awhile in the kitchen before beeing served. I live 2 blocks from the place, so it didn't happen because I had to drive home. \n\nI have given it multiple tries to make make sure it wasn't a one time bad mealI would not recommend this place to anyone."
3,"A godsend for South Las Vegans. No more will we have to drive the 15 minute route to Chinatown for a noodle fix. No more will we have to fight off bad drivers for parking. Here,we have found home. \n\nMonta Chaya is conveniently located off the 215 on Eastern,making it a central location for our brothers and sisters in Green Valley,as well as not too much of a commute from Silverado Ranch dwellers. \n\nThe service is quick and efficient - I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my food,and the wait staff is always polite and - to an extent - authentic in their Japanese roots. \n\nThe food is decent quality - slightly greasy and could use bigger portions,but my biggest issue with their menu is its limited scope. Yes,it's a ramen place,and they serve a few rice topping bowls,but missing some Japanese house staples like chicken cutlet (tonkatsu). \n\nAll in all,it's not a bad place for a late night meal (closes at 11pm most nights),which makes it a good late post-gym alternative if you don't want to cook. \n\nLong. Live. Monta."

1,"I've been wanting to try Bourbon Steak for ages, and thought Restaurant Week might be a good time. But sadly, it was a disappointment, and I doubt that we will go back. There are too many other choices nearby that outshine them, like Mastro's. The farm salad was average (told no tomatoes available), the \""prime hanger steak\"" was so chewy, my husband spit out the bite I shared with him. It was cooked to correct degree of doneness, however.  Tables were ultra close together so that the party of 2 businessmen sitting at a table next to us were close enough that they could have been our guests. Noisy and busy, even though our reservation was 5:30 pm on a week night.  It was hard to hear the explanation of the food, like the paring of the 3 kinds of fries with the 3 dipping sauces, or what was that puddle of sauce/potatoes under my steak.  Loud music blaring (Tom Petty, Bob Dylan) We had trouble getting our \""doggie bag\"" that truly went to our dogs. Our server never came back, and we had to track down our busser. The complimentary french fries were good, and they gave complimentary little bags of caramel corn with the payment. But when I contrast the food and service with other Restaurant Week experiences, this falls short. Some places like Fleming's and Eddie V's became regular stops with us due to a very positive Restaurant Week experience. Bourbon Steak is a very casual place for one so pricey. Even the wait staff wears jeans. I would imagine that if you order off the regular menu, it would be at least $100 per person with tax/tip. Burgers in the bar are $18. Fleming's at DC Ranch offers a better one with better atmosphere for $6. Tonic in mixed drink was flat. Wine by the glass very pricey. Ladies Room needed attention. Used washcloths were not put in basket, toilet not flushed, no seat covers. Surprisingly dated rest room for place remodeled from the fabulous Masquesa just 6 years ago. Hope they do a better job on the remodel of The Grill."
1,"My wife got diarrhea pretty bad after eating from this place. The meat was chewy, the rice and beans tasted old and cheap like from a can. Nothing really tasted good except maybe  the fries out of my carne asada fries. I would prefer Robertos to place any day, and I don't like Robertos..."
4,This was our second time to use Warren's Homework.  They are punctual and very careful with all of your belongings.  Nothing was broken.  They move fast and take  no breaks. If we move again we will definitely use their services.
2,"We just walked out after being seated for 15 minutes, and no one taking our order. We've been twice before. Every time the service has been slow, but nothing like today. Every time the waitresses have been standing over by the drink station talking while leaving customers waiting. When the left today the hostess who sat us didn't say a word. It's a shame they are so unprofessional, becacuse the food is actually good. They clearly don't care if they have customers or make money. The place is always only a third to a half full, but they can't actually serve the people trying to eat there.\n\nEDIT: 1/16/13: We gave this place another try, and it was much better the second time. Have been back several times since with no issues. The food is very good."
3,Come for the happy hour! This place has got to be the BEST place to bring a first date.
4,"This place is fantastic! Great food, and I love Kiltlifter. It is one of the only beers I will order when I go out, to four peaks or otherwise. Burger was great, bacon on it was cooked splendedly"
2,"If 2-stars means \""meh, I've had better\"", then I'd have to give it 2 stars. I'd say if \""fine\"" in the slightly pained way the means \""how about we think of someplace else. \""\n\nNow, not that it's bad, because its not. A good beer selection, nice bar clean, nice staff.  Good place to watch the last round of the Masters. But if 3 stars means A-OK, I'd have to give 2.5.  The menu is uninspired, the food is ok but expensive, the decor is a little funny. \n\nBetter places on the north shore."
4,"I've always loved the Vig since the first time I went.  The food is good, the presentation is good, but most of all I just love the atmosphere.  Very relaxed, reminds me of California.  Very artsy and sophisticated.  love it.  I guess Unique is the word I'm looking for, and I looove unique.  Phoenix has so many restaurants and they all seem similar, but the Vig has a personality of it's own."
4,"Charlotte, look no further for a well-done mani and pedi! No, really!\n\nService: impeccable. The front desk people were nice and guided me upstairs to the next person to have me seated for my nail salonist - who, Dashelle, rocks (does a clean job, very friendly, and all the works!)\n\nVenue: from an old firehouse that was ready to be knocked down, but saved by the city of Charlotte -- made into a salon. You can see the charms of the place, like the brick walls. I love how spacious, lofty feel, clean, cozy, and trendy it feels in here. Every space was used for the bar area, hair area, lobby, laser rooms, lipo rooms, and nail spa rooms.\n\nPrice: I would say a little higher than the usual place for nails -- but it is worth $35 for my pedi for good service and being pampered. I had 2 bad lucks with other places, and this one fits the bill.\n\nWho to ask: I saw Ally did one of my friend's mani, and she did a fabulous job. I had Dashelle, and I looked at any flaws on my toes, and I did not see any. So, she gets an A+."
1,I really was disappointed with the atmosphere. The music and song selection was low volume and horrible. They have a lot of windows which makes it really hot and they don't turn the AC down. I got a filet and it was really salty and unappetizing. The price was extremely high and for the price it's so not worth it.
1,"I won't be going back even though the food and the beer were great.  We had a group of approximately 10 couples.  When we got our bill they added 20% gratuity, ok I can deal with that.  Where I had a big problem was the server would not divide out each couples portion of the bill or total out each couples bill.  They made you total out your own bill, then figure your tax and then figure your own portion of gratuity.  It was a huge hassle and it took forever for everyone to get the one check and subtract their portion.   Very poor and frustrating business policy."
0,Failed company. Liars. Bad customer service and bad representatives on the phone with bad attitude and I cannot forget the smartassness of the manager on the phone.
1,"Stayed here for two nights - very average, nothing special at all. Got the rooms from Hotel.com, paid $80 with tax and the useless resort fees. The room's window were very small making the room very dark. All of the furnitures and appliances were old. Refrigerator was not working, \""free\"" wifi was down due to technical problems, mattress cover was dirty, iron had burnt remains stuck to the plates and the television was down too. I thought about calling the front desk with these issues but didn't want to waste my time as I was there for 2 nights only. Honestly, I will not be coming back to this hotel in the future. I'd rather pay little more and stay in a better hotel. 2 stars for the bed comfort level and decent bathroom."
1,"We were very excited to try this restaurant and went there on Saturday night for my husband's birthday. After reading a lot of the Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to the food and was concerned about the poor service many before us reviewed.\n\nWell as you may guess by the rating, neither the food or the service was up to par. In my opinion, one of the very best things a restaurant can do to ensure its success is to make sure their servers are knowledgeable, gracious, super efficient & personable. If I'd had that, I'd probably give the food another chance. \n\nThe most glaring failure during order taking was asking if we wanted bread or frites with our mussels and failing to mention when my husband said frites that he would again be served French fries with his brisket sandwich. Who seriously needs 2 orders of fries during 1 service? Our first beers we ordered off the bar menu were served in cans - that's an inexcusable restaurant decision that I wish they had made more obvious on that bar menu. Seriously, it's a gastropub not a tailgate!  Draft beers were not mentioned by our server and had we not read the board on the other side of the bar and done an online search for the beer's description, we wouldn't have known they existed or what they were. She had no idea about any of the drafts when we asked.\n\nSo many things on the menu were appealing we decided to order 4 items. We started with the smoked wings (recommended highly by other Yelpers) and the curry mussels. I got the feeling if we hadn't specified to our server that we considered the final 2 items to be our entrees, that all 4 items would have shown up at our ridiculously tiny table for 2 at once. When the 2 appetizers arrived at once we had to pile everything on top of each other because the table didn't have room for 2 appetizers plus 2 small appetizer plates. The wings were actually really delicious with a nice smokey flavor and turned out to be  the highlight of the meal. The mussels were nicely sized and plentiful but the curry sauce was sorely lacking in flavor. \n\nThen our server disappeared for 20 minutes, stopped by to tell us she was sorry about our wait but our food would be up in 1 minute, then disappeared for 25 additional minutes. My husband found her scurrying by long enough to tell her to please cancel the rest of our food if it wasn't already sitting in the back. She disappeared for another 5 minutes and appeared with only my husband's brisket sandwich which came with more frites. She squeezed into the tiny space between us & the next table and informed me that my short rib flatbread had hit the floor as she was racing it to our table but that they had started another one and it would be done in 7 minutes. Not sure why the first one couldn't come out in 45 if it only took 7 to cook. \n\nNeither the brisket nor the flatbread were very good and unfortunately our attitudes toward Meat & Potatoes weren't either by the end of the evening."
4,"Kennywood has become a magical Christmas wonderland!  One that you can wander happily through while marveling at the sight of the lights and the sounds of caliope Christmas carols.   We enjoyed the scent of the campfires scattered throughout the park to warm our hands and the comforting smells of hot cocoa and warm cider to warm our tummies.  All the while, the sounds of  ooohs and aaahs of children (and adults) warmed our hearts.  \n\nWhat to do?  Ride the Merry-go-Round, or the Kennywood train that takes you through a light display that on Saturday night included a great big beautiful full moon.   It actually rivaled the lights of the Christmas displays!   Kiddieland was filled with little ones, moms and dads and grandparents, too.  Almost all the rides in Kiddieland were open.  There were more adult rides open than I imagined there would be and more than advertised.  And to top it off, all the rides were decorated with Christmas lights!\n\nThere were ice carvers, miniature train displays, cookie decorating, Santa Claus himself and all the Kennywood characters all waiting to greet excited boys and girls and the adults with them.  Flashes of cameras were exploded all over the place as memories were captured of the very first, and hopefully JUST the first, new Pittsburgh Christmas tradition,...Kennywood Christmas in the park.  \n\nGo.  Take your camera.  The reflections of the lights on the lagoon were especially beautiful and I captured many beautiful shots for what may be my Christmas card next year!  Whomever we have to thank for the gift of a Kennywood Christmas has my thanks from the bottom of my heart."
4,This place is off the Hook! All of the food was excellent. Service was perfect and the beer was cold. Great atmosphere with the music from the Carnival Court. Good price and great portions.
3,"I'm upgrading my rating to 4 stars after my most recent BRGR visit.\n\n1. My Kobe burger was probably about 50% bigger than it has been on previous occasions. That alone may be worth the extra star, since that was my biggest issue with BRGR (other than that whole, no customizations thing, which still stands).\n\n2. The fries are still just alright. But my friend coaxed me into trying the truffled cheese whiz, which I was a bit skeptical of. Even though I love truffle anything, I'm picky when it comes to fake cheese sludge. Turns out, BRGR's fake cheese sludge is dangerously addictive. I think I'm in love.\n\n3. The food presentation actually matches the ambiance. The new wire baskets are way sleeker than the red plastic Chipotle-esque ones they were using before.\n\n4. Banana milkshakes!! I now have a flavor to get excited about!\n\nCongratulations for finally getting on top of your game, BRGR!"
2,"Not bad for the price you pay. Spacious rooms, beds, clean, quick service. I just hate that all their toiletries smell like men's cologne."
0,"I've been to this store several times over the past few years and I don't know why I keep going back. Every time it's a horrible experience. I am planning to learn my lesson this time.\n\nThe meat there is a huge problem (lots of brown/gray, rancid-looking stuff sold at full price) but the worst thing is the cashier service. \n\nDespite the time of day, they only ever seem to have 1 register open. Which means that, to buy a single item in the AM, it's a 20 minute wait at least. \n\nToday at 8 AM the line for the single register was 10 people long. It took so long that the lady in front of me, who only wanted some orange juice, finally dropped out of line and left. I was still standing there 15 minutes later. \n\nHere's the WORST part: The manager walked by the line 2 different times, looked right at it, and kept walking. \n\nHe didn't open a register himself to speed those commuters on their way. He didn't ask the woman at customer service to come up and open one. He just saw the grumpy people in line and ignored it. \n\nThis is why Safeway - especially this one - is failing. \n\nManager Ben, you just lost Safeway 2 customers today - at least."
2,"I was here for drinks and appys so I don't know how it does for a full meal.  Darker wood decor, I suppose to be french inspired.  Service is good and food came quickly.  Nice wine selection.  I can't recall everything I sampled that night but I was generally happy with the quality, but not enough to come back for a full meal considering the other choices in Vegas."
1,"Hands down, the most misleading radio station name I have ever heard.\n\nThis is NOT a mix station, it is a MODERN POP station. The quality of music on here is a solid 3/5 rating, but I took a star away for the misleading name.\n\nEssentially, this is modern pop hits covering the last few years, though they tend to throw in the occasional 80s pop sons (though this is less common in recent years.) If you like modern pop music, this is a good station, no questions asked. But if you're looking for a real mix station, go with Jack FM."
1,"I think this place is a little deceiving. Based on the interior of the casino and the price of its restaurants, they want you to believe the hotel is fancier than it actually is. The only real kudos I can give the Monte Carlo is its location on the strip, proximity to other casinos, and their fitness center (see below).\n\nThe room was ok. No luxury, just the nuts and bolts of a standard room. The Monte Carlo offers very cheap deals during weekdays, but note they do charge a MANDATORY resort fee daily. I believe the fee is about $15 and includes high speed internet (but not wi fi...crazy!!!!!) and access to the gym (but not the spa). These were the only two amenities I used during the visit. I had my laptop and had to use a plug-in cord, which did not work very well. The Internet kept cutting in and out...very annoying. The gym was a pleasant surprise; it had nice equipment and it was not overly crowded. \n\nWould I stay here again? Probably not, in a town that prides itself on exceptional hotel quality (ie, the Palazzo), I will continue looking for deals and pay a little more to stay at nicer hotels. Some might say, \""why spend so much $$ on a hotel room in Vegas that you won't spend much time in?\"" My rebuttal is that I am on vacation and want to be pampered. To each their own."
3,"Went with a living social deal, but I would definatelty return without one. I ordered fettuccine alfredo and my husband ordered a pepperoni calzone. The portions were too large to finish. We went on a Friday and the place filled up quick, so go early. Next time I go, I will try the sicilian pizza. Also, great service!"
1,Average - expected more.  Not much flavor.  Service was pretty good.
1,I have to say that this is very close to the worst sushi I have had in my life
0,"I will never set foot back in this store!! i have never received such horrible customer service in my life. I took in my husband battery for them to test it. I had a few questions because I don't know shit about car batteries. Well this woman had sarcastic comments, rolled her eyes at me, and started talking about me to another employee who in turn rolled her eyes. I'm sorry I didn't know what \""platinum, gold, or silver\"" ment.  It's your job to help people and answer questions. I very calmly called this woman out about her behavior and her response was; \"" I always act like this.\"" I should point out this woman was easily 40 years old not a teenager!! Sears might want to consider the disposition of the people they hire.  So, thank you lady, because of you I will never go to Sears again and will tell everyone about what a huge bitch you are!!"
0,"I stopped in to get a head shave and a beard trim, most horrible experience ever!  I walked in, nobody greeted me, I waited for quite a while and then when I thought I was next, a guy walks in a takes my spot.  Apparently he had an appointment, then I'm up next again and a mother with two boys walk in and they had an appointment. I'm 45 years old and been going to barbers all my life, I've never been ousted twice like that and since when does a man's barber take appointments like a beauty salon. The guy draped the hot damp towel over my head and didn't make sure I had an air path, I felt like I was going to suffacate, TWICE!  He shorten my beard and mustache and wasn't going to trim and edge them. I had to ask if he was going to edge them.  I will never go back there.  A head shave and facial hair trim is suppose to be relaxing, I was stressed out the entire time and the amount of lotion/oil he left on my head and neck was enough to lubricate my Ford truck."
1,"I really do love the food here but the rest of the experience just makes me never want to go back.\n\nI've been several times where I've had to wait much much too long for my food. Even at lunch in the middle of the week when the restaurant was only half full. But last night took the cake.\n\nWe came in and since there were no free tables, we sat at the bar. We ordered some sodas and then our food pretty quickly. I had to be at work an hour and a half later so we definitely thought there'd be plenty of time but after 45 minutes without getting our food, I was getting very anxious. I finally asked a waitress to check on our food and I told her I had to leave soon to go to work. She kind of dilly-dallied into the kitchen and came back out and told us that our waitress would let us know what was going on.\n\nOur waitress came back out, did some stuff on the computer, cleaned some plates, and all while I was just staring at her waiting for an answer. Finally she comes to me and says that the kitchen lost a few tickets or I guess they thought our food had already come out or some lame answer. I told her to forget it because I just couldn't wait any longer. She said \""well don't worry about the drinks.\"" Thanks...if I had known I was going to get free drinks instead of dinner, I would've ordered a bottle of wine. I would've really appreciated a gift certificate or something.\n\nNow, I have worked in many restaurants and I understand things happen. But she really should've noticed after 20 minutes that we have not had our food and checked on it herself. The fact that I had to ask and then there was no sense of urgency or sincere remorse really irked me. I ended up going down to Fuel for a quick slice of pizza and inhaled it before work. Not what I had looked forward to doing right before 6 hours on my feet serving people drinks.\n\nI think I'll just be officially done with this place. Unfortunately."
1,"After hearing a lot of positive things about this place, I figured I'd give it a shot this week. I got the beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and a small Fiji water. It ran me about $12. Eek, that's pretty expensive. \n\nThe mashed potatoes, which I tried first, were quite good. Soft and creamy with some skin in them, just how I like them. Then I moved on to the sandwich. Can I say purple meat? Purple. Not red, just purple, Disgusting! I picked out the pieces that looked decent, and they were okay, not great. The bun was allright. The fried pickle that came with each meal was okay, I only had one bite. \n\nService was fine, really not bad or good. Overall, I'd skip Brookwood and head to Bad Daddy's in C or even Quizno's next door."
2,"Great food, awesome atmosphere. We needed this in southern highlands. Great service in the bar area but the restaurant service needs improvement"
1,"The food was alright, not earth shattering. More than anything the service was terrible! They screwed up out order, and instead of making our food immediately, they spent a good 10 minutes of trying to figure out how they messed it up. So what should have been a 15 minute wait for food, we waited over 30. To top it off, we weren't offered any consultation or compensation for the additional wait."
1,"Oh Over Easy, you taco bell looking motherfucker. I had such high hopes for this place, I mean the only thing better than breakfast in my book is MAGIC and well there wasn't a whole lot of that coming from my meal. I ordered steak and eggs (a classic) which was like 7 or 8 bucks (in the back of my mind I knew there was a hitch), but instincts aside I was still hyped, sadly like most things in my life disappointment:)  The \""Steak\"" basically was badly seasoned deli roast beef stacked over my horribly cooked eggs, my plate was over flowing with watery steak juice it really should have been served in a bowl it was gross I mean gross, the coffee drink was good (kinda girly) and the decor was aiight. \n\nSo if you find yourself waking up sunday morning smelling like crown royal and cigarettes with someone you barely know and never want to know again take them here.\n\nOh yeah\n\""Matt's makes this place look like a cracked out denny's or taco bell (ha because it used to be one I know I'm lame) zing.\"""
4,"This place is great! Good food, amazing service, Brady and Alex are always on top of their game!! Also other bartenders on the same shift are great!! Always a good time!!"
0,"Is there an option for 0 stars? If so go ahead and count me. My mom recently got a haircut, nail, facial. And I looked at my credit statement and its charging me close to $350. Not sure if there is some initial charge and later they decrease the amount they are actually charging. But it left me with a smelly after taste. I am going to follow up with them and find out the exact details."
2,"The white fish taco is so far the best. I've tried other things, but they are not as good. During busy times, this place is a headache. I ordered something to go on a late Saturday evening and went to Cabos to pick it up. There is nowhere really to stand and wait other than beside the bar, and some rude waitress yelled at me for being in her way. Other than having no designated area just for pickup, the food is good and I will be back."
1,"We came here because all of the other restaurants were busy.  Had no problem getting a seat here.  Should've realized that was a bad sign. Awkward seating, literally has the ambience of a sports stadium, if you're into that sort of thing.  Food was pretty bad.  We were eager to leave."
0,"Very high prices, you can find prices 10 - 30% less online with free shipping and zero sales tax!  I cannot understand why anyone buys at these high price retailers unless they want to give away their money and charity would be a better cause helping homeless animals!\n\nWayne Gorsek"
3,"Being a giant fan of Giada I was so excited to hear she opened up her own restaurant here in my hometown, sin city. I found out the wait list for her restaurant is about 4 months long and saw my hopes of dining there slip away. Come to find out my best friend surprised  me by making reservations months in advance for my birthday and my dreams came true. \n\nWe had 1:45 reservations, we walk up to the hostess at about 1:20 to let her know we were in the vicinity, she made it very clear that she didn't want anything to do with us until our strict 1:45 reservation time. Our time came and I went back to the desk to let her know we're ready, she had our table ready very promptly at 1:45.\n\nThe dining area at first glance is beautiful, pristine white makes everything look sparkling clean. We are seated and In a few moments the waiter is over. He goes over the menu in depth and gives us a moment to decide. \n\nWhen he returns he answers all our questions in great detail and listened to our\nSpecific needs (one of us doesn't eat meat). We ordered the wood roasted mushrooms and chicken orzo meatballs to start. Also ordered two muddled strawberries which is a brilliant concoction of tea,lemonade,strawberries, and basil. All\nOf these dishes were an absolute smash. We order our main dishes which were a frittata and Giada's lasagna. Both of these dishes were great and we had not a single complaint with them. They also bring you a sort of pita bread with a pesto oil spread which is great as well. They have a gentleman of whose job it is to make sure your water is always full which was nice. With it being my birthday we of course ordered dessert which was a tiramisu and a cappuccino of sorts with Nutella. They even wrote \""happy birthday\"" in chocolate on my\nPlate. These Desserts really smashed this experience through the roof.\n\nAs we wait for the waiter to bring the bill I see Giada Herself talking to some patrons in the restaurant. My heart of course stops and our waiter personally asked her to come to my table because it was my birthday. She sat and took a picture with me, wished me a happy birthday, made sure our lunch was everything we expected, and said she liked my hair. I died on the inside. The food was awesome, our waiter was a class act, and the Giada was everything I'd hope she be. \n\nThe reasons I gave this four stars ........ The epic waiting list which reaches 4 months\nIs extreme but totally understandable. The portion sizes of these dishes are minimal at best and very pricey. \n\nEveryone should definitely try this restaurant. Not a place to get full but a dynamite venue for a special event. From the food to the staff to Giada herself an absolute smash."
2,"Had the vegan burger, the patty fell apart, and that happens sometimes with veggie patties, but it also lacked flavor.  The fat fries were good but not exceptional.The husband had the margarita pizza it was nice and thin but also lacked seasoning. Next time I'll try something else, I'm not willing to give up on this place yet."
3,SO MUCH BEER!\n\nIf you are trying to be a purveyor of micro beers and local made beers..\nthis would be the place.\n\nBeen here twice..had such a great time. \nBar: nice and pretty.\nPlace: Loud but enjoyable\nPrice:  Take some cash to make things easierrrr....like 50 to make it a good time.\n\n\nR|_
4,"One of our favorites!  Great Cuban food - excellent service. Always look forward to a wonderful dining experience here and even if it takes almost an hour to drive here, we still will make every effort to be here often."
4,Spanks tbell all day. Their hot sauce is actually hot and ya can't beat the prices ;)
2,"Low marks because of its location, quite depressing but other than that it is ok."
4,they had this special when i was there in june.. 2 patron shots for $10!! (during 10pm-11pm i think)  that means $5 per shot of patron!!  we took quite a few shots here before heading to XS. \n\nfun times.
0,"So I constantly get ads in the mail for this place and finally decided to try it. When we called they were friendly but were placed on hold twice... in one call. Fast forward to almost 2 hours later. (We called after an hour to see what the hold up was, guy claimed the driver had left 7 mins prior.) So the driver hardly spoke english and couldn't find the place. We opened up our food which was 2 medium pizzas, wings, and breadsticks. We also added on fries which were in the same container as the wings so the fries were soaked and soggy. Wings weren't good at all and neither were the fries. Pizza was ok as were the breadsticks. But I wouldn't ordered here again if they paid me, not for a 2 hour wait."
0,"When we arrived on a Saturday night at about 8:30. The place was empty. Not a good sign. As we were seated, the host said, I have a party coming later, you might want to sit far away - and we did. \n\nHowever, the food was uneventful. And nothing like I've had in Persian Resturants in the Middle East. The service was average. However, the group - of about eight men - totall destroyed the evening. They had a keyboard player/singer. As soon as they started up -- well, my ears are still ringing this morning! \n\nWill I go back. No. Service/Average. Food/Average. Pricing/Normal for off strip. Ambiance - Nothing to write home about."
4,"This is my go-to place.  The service is always amazing, the food is consistently delicious.  It is my favorite Thai restaurant.  I recommend the crab rangoons, beef jerky, and green curry!"
1,"This location is terrible. I have been to multiple tropical smoothie caf\u00e9s in the past and always get King Ceasar wrap, which is usually amazing. It tasted nothing like the norm here, was much smaller and didn't even include the pickles on the side.\n\nDon't bother coming here."
2,Dave: Standard issue Lowe's\n\nSheila: This store is huge! A better selection of items than Home Depot.  The store itself was clean and neatly organized.\n\nThe staff were friendly and helpful.\n\nThe bathrooms were grosse!
0,"I have been a Lee's fan for a while but tried to stop visiting franchises and concentrate on mom and pop.  After driving down Spring Mountain, I had to stop and try.\n\nThe service is ok.  They were very happy to see you there and they were quick at getting your order.  I ordered the banh bao and it was disgusting.  I swear there is a piece of hot dog in it!  The manjo was very good.  My son ate it all up.  The hallow bread is a rip off!!!!!  They have signs that said $1.29 and they charge you $1.59.  When you ask them why they charge you a different price, their answer is \""The price goes up every 2 weeks.\""  After rolling my eyes, they know they won't get any further business from us.\n\nThe sandwich was tasteless.  The bread made it taste better than what it really did.  They just pulled the bread out of the oven and it was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  There was absolutely no meat on the inside.  It looked like there was little slivers of meat and a crap load of veggies to hide the embarrassment.  There was a streak mark of pate.  I was very disappointed."
0,"I have given this place chance after chance. I don't know why they have the elderly man still making the food. I have nothing against him personally and give him respect for trying, but it's clearly time to retire. The food is HORRIBLE! I order two orders of Egg Foo Young for me and my friend. That was $25 down the drain because neither of us ate more than 1 of the 4 patties it came with! It was the WORST EFY we have both ever eaten. I feel bad because it was my idea to go there!\nI will NEVER give this place my money again!"
0,"Overall, I was very disappointed with my experience at this location.  When I used to live in Henderson, the PostNet on Horizon had AMAZING customer service.  \n\nI went in today for a passport picture which seems easy enough.  When I got to the post office to submit my application, I was told that my application would be rejected because I looked \""naked,\"" and that the company that took my picture should have be aware of that.  The lady at the post office said that PostNet clearly made the mistake and that they should give me a refund.  I had to drive all the way back to get my picture retaken and the owner made me pay for half of the cost of a new picture.  I paid $17 today for passport pictures and that is a bit ridiculous.  I didn't even want the first set taken because what do I need them for?  \n\nI definitely will not be back to this location.  And ladies, if you take a passport picture, make sure you aren't wearing a tube top!  It's apparently a no-no and I found that out the hard way!"
3,"I have no romantic attachment to Madison, Bucky, or State Street. I've been to Madison twice in my life. So when it comes to the Overture Center, I'm a fan. Great place, great theatre with fabulous acoustics, and an impressive programming schedule.\n\nI came here on a Saturday night to see my friend's band play. And the theatre with its sparkling acoustics, decent site lines, and semi-unhorrible seats, was impressive. \n\nI didn't get a chance to see the rest of the center (save for a few minutes during daylight, when I watched a young bride and her bridesmaids posing for pictures on one of the balconies) but I understand how the architecture could be seen as incongruous with the rest of the area. I, however, don't mind the contrast of post-modernism with classical American architecture, and find the juxtaposition playful and daring."
1,"Went here based on recommendation from the hotel. There wasnt much in the area. It was a friday night they didn't have the nba all star game on just olympic ice skating and the sports illustrated swimsuit awards as well as 20/20. The waitress constantly forgot things that we asked for. She did not know the menu. and the spicy lemon pepper wings were way to spicy to even taste the lemon pepper. I sent them back and I over heard the gentleman in the booth behind me send his back for the same reason. I did enjoy the sandwich and fries that I ordered afterwards. If im in the area again, I dont know if id go back, maybe if there are no other options."
2,"Very good bakery right down the street with good hours.  This morning we picked up croissants to-go.  My DH had ham and cheese which he reports was very good, but perhaps too much ham.  I had turkey and cheese and removed the majority of the turkey because it was too much meat for me.  My dad had ham and cheese and thought it was great!  My mom had a lemon croissant which she reports is excellent.  I should add that my husband and I aren't huge meat eaters, so many people would consider the amount of meat to be a sufficient and acceptable quantity.\n\nThere were numerous people sitting on the tables outside and everyone looked to be having a great time!  The bakery did offer a croissant that I believe had jalape\u00f1os and ham and it made me think how good a nice, savory croissant with only cheese and jalape\u00f1os could be.  Yummy!!\n\nService was efficient and friendly.   Will definitely return."
1,"The shrimp cocktail and the lobster bisque were delicious. The wine was good, but way overpriced. The main courses were a mess overall. The food had obviously had a wait time at the window. The top of my mushrooms were cold, the mash had a skin on them, and one of our parties rib eye was luke warm.  Solid appetizers but if you are a steak house get the steak right for starters. My fillet was just OK. I read the above comment about comparing it to outback and if i am being truly honest. I have had better fillets there as well. \n\nThe fillet was also served on some overcooked version of home fried. Small cubes of hard potato with tough bacon bits. Better to just leave it off the plate entirely. \n\nI won't be going back, especially when you consider for less money, you can cross the street and have a great meal at Spago, where the quality never is subject to question."
4,Best comic store in vegas love it and the owner is really kool kool guy
2,"Called to make reservations for a party of 7, Hostess on the phone said they were booked and pretty busy however we can walk in and wait... \n\nOn the way down I was able to make Reservation via Internet, however we still thought the Restaurant would have at least an hour wait for a \""BUSY\"" Saturday night as the Hostess stated.... come to our surprise Restaurant was far from Busy, and we were sat almost instantly. \n\nVery pleased with the Food, Great sized Portions, Complimentary bread oil and vinegar, however being lied too over the phone was rude, and almost made us change our dinner plans for the evening...."
0,"Decided to stop by on Christmas Day about 5 pm because there was an hour wait at SanTan Brewery . We wanted to get some quick appetizers and hang out till our table was ready at the other restaurant. It was about 10 minutes until a frail looking blonde waitress (who looked like she needed something to eat and to maybe lay off whatever prescription drugs she was taking) came up and asked us if we were ready to order.... We hadn't even received menus yet, but asked for water while we looked them over. Another 7-10 minutes go by and she comes back, still hasn't dropped off our drinks and asked us if we were ready, we ordered 2 appetizers, she didn't write it down and left. My boyfriend ordered an epicenter and 55 minutes later we still have no appetizers and empty water cups. \n\nSide note: I can't put all the blame on the waitress, but whoever made the schedule for that day should be fired. There was 1 server, the bartender and what seemed to be the manager on duty. So 3 people running FOH on Christmas Day....  Just terrible planning. \n\nBtw-we never saw the blonde again. We watched as she was giving the wrong food/drinks to the wrong tables and walking around with a confused look on her face. \nWe waved down (who we thought was) the manager on duty, a very nice brunette who seemed to be running the entire place, and asked the status of our order. She informed us that the blonde had never even rang it in and she'd get it to us ASAP, which she did and apologized profusely and took care of our meal for us.  We felt bad and wanted to leave her something but when we went to get money out of their ATM, it was out of service. \n\nAll in all, it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant . Hopefully upper management will plan better for next year."
1,Tha atomosphere at the Rainforest is delightful especially for a 7 year old's birthday. But it is pricey.... 2.99 for ice tea or soda.... Sandwhiches average $15...but what I thought was really cheesey was the .99 charge for a birthday cupcake  Really???\nCome on.... Definite rip off!!!!!\nBut for a special occasion it was worth it :)
3,"Haven't tried a bite here that wasn't amazing. Try the brisket, try the shrimp. Sides are bit smaller than I would like but I guess that is why they are called sides- I was just craving more beans! They also have rocking Yelp and Foursquare specials that make happening upon this truck all the more delicious."
1,"We have lived by this place for about two years but hadn't tried it.  We've been very adventurous lately with trying new places so we decided to go for it.   The yelp reviews were mostly positive so we figured it couldn't be that bad.\n\nWe decided to do take out and ordered our food over the phone.  The person answering the phone was very polite and took the order without issue.  When we arrived to pick up the food the staff was incredibly polite which was great.  We received everything we ordered without any issues which seems to be a rare thing these days.\n\nI had ordered the crab enchiladas since they advertised real crab meat.  The other items were carne asada and bean/cheese burritos.  The dinners had sides of beans/rice and we also had chips/salsa with our order.  The boxes were huge.  The food inside didn't come anywhere near filling the boxes.  There was nothing wrong with the portion sizes which were perfectly adequate.  They were just in boxes that weren't appropriately sized.  \n\nThe first thing I did was try the chips/salsa.  The chips were good and I don't know if they make them or get them from someone else.  The salsa which is supposed to be house made had a major cumin overload.  I tried it a few times and then that was it.  I didn't want any more for the chips or my enchiladas.  I went and grabbed a bottle of Cholula out of my pantry.\n\nI moved on to the crab enchiladas.  The sauce was okay but the crab meat tasted kind of fishy.  I couldn't tell if it was fake or if it was just old but either way it wasn't great.  It wasn't horrible but it definitely was not quality food worthy of the price.  The beans/rice were decent.  The carne asada and bean/cheese burritos were okay.  \n\nOther than the funky crab meat and the pure cumin salsa, the rest of the meal was just okay.  It wasn't bad and it wasn't overpriced.  It was just a \""meh\"" type experience.  Given the choice, I would gladly go around the corner and go to Garcia's.  It's not the best Mexican food experience either but definitely a better quality and much more enjoyable than this place."
4,Love this place.  They have the best sandwiches in town.
4,"My boyfriend and I eat (too much pizza) here at least once a week. Their lunch deals are just unbeatable. Huge amounts of great food for very little money. Personally, I think this location has the best pizza, since the taste does vary a bit from location to location."
0,"8/11/11\n\nAfter reading so many reviews about how great Maggiano's happy hour was, I decided to check it out myself and use a $10 gift card that Maggiano's had sent to me in honor of my birthday.  [Yes, I'm writing this review almost two years' later... I am that backlogged with reviews and photos- bear with me.  I don't think that these should be discounted based on how long it's been since these visits, because I (and others) could use these observations to see if the restaurants and their service and products have improved, or in some cases, worsened.)]  \n\nWas going to try a couple of the apps when I spotted the Four-Cheese Ravioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ#GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ on the dinner menu.  The description mentioned ricotta, cream cheese, mozz, and provolone in a pesto-alfredo cream sauce, and I was hooked (\""ricotta,\"" \""pesto,\"" and \""alfredo\"" hook me in 95% of the time).  Unfortunately, the dish was a HUGE letdown... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA#dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA  All but two of the ravioli were half-frozen (especially at the edges), and the flavors?  All of the cheeses, marinara sauce, and pesto-alfedo cream sauce tasted the same!  All bland, without any distinction between them.  I tasted samples from allover the plate, from all components, separately and together, and couldn't discern any difference.  Even the entree's appearance was subpar.  Suffice it to say, I have not stepped foot into another Maggiano's since.\n\nThe two good comments I could say are that the restaurant was quiet (no one was there) and the plates were quaint-looking, with that old-fashioned rose-and-bone tinted floral print."
0,"This is my favorite spot for AYCE but today I am very disappointed.  Found HAIR in my food TWICE today. This is not acceptable. Plus customer service is wack today as well. I showed the waitress hair I found TWICE so she knew about it then she jokingly asked me \""is everything okay? No more hair?\"" WTF kind of a joke is that? Ugh."
1,"This was the second time going here. I got a fabulous hair cut, although it was much shorter than I requested.\nMy second visit was for highlights and it was a bad experience. I had no knowledge of what the process was, and the man who was doing my hair barely explained what he was doing. At the end, the color was great, although much more than I wanted. \nThe issue wasn't until I went to pay. I was shocked at how much it cost, the stylist had never gone over any \""extra charges\"" with me. I was charged $50 more than I had planned on spending, for glaze (which I wasn't even aware of, the guy never mentioned this) and toner, which he did mentioned but said nothing about the price.\nI was too much in shell shock to really do anything and so I paid.\n\nI will be canceling my future haircut, mainly because I was not told about the extra charges and I felt I was taken advantage of. \n\nOther than this, my experiences were pretty well, aside from him straightening my mixed race hair without blow drying it first. My hair felt fried afterwards!"
3,"I'm quite jealous of Einstein Bros. Bagels.\n\nI'm jealous because no matter how hard I try, I CAN NOT make a bacon, egg and cheese bagel sandwich that's anywhere near as good as theirs. My preferred bagel is Asiago, and I can never seem to find those kinds of bagels in any store. \n\nAlso, props to making some very good iced coffee(which is actually cheaper than McDonald's coffee. Sure, you have to mix in sugar and milk yourself, but their coffee is of much better quality.\n\nThank god they don't have free Wi-Fi, or else I would have no life outside of this place."
1,"The food just isn't very good. The service is not very good either. However, they find a way to keep the place packed. I just have no motivation to go back and eat there."
2,"Kaya has one of the very best happy hours in town, and the space inside is nice.  \n\nPros:\n\nGood happy hour\nI will knife fight you for the last glob of the bean dip, it is THAT good.\n\nCons:\nThe service is iffy and the staff can be rude.  Dont try going there without a reservaton and expect to be seated at a table without the hostess letting you know she is BOTHERED\n\nThe food is just ok.  It is not great.  In my opinion, this is the weakest of the Big Burrito's restaurants.  I ordered Paella the last time I was there and it was so pungently fishy it was inedible and I had to send it back\n\nIf you dine here, stick to the appetizers and enjoy some good cocktails.  I'll go here again, but this is not my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh."
4,"I've been to Chelsea's in the past so this really isn't my first time here nor was it my only great experience but that was my pre-Yelping days so here it goes.\n\nI took my mother here today for a second Mother's Day outing and arrived a little after opening which was good as the place was packed by noon. The hostess was friendly and sat us at a booth. I love the interior of this place; lots of brick, stone, wood and high ceilings not to mention a beautiful bar overlooking the patio which I will definitely be returning to check out more closely. \n\nStarted out by ordering the Prickly Pear Margarita...so yummy and it's a pretty drink (hot pink). Perfect for the hot weather. We split the Del Mar Salad...amazing! The shrimp and crab tasted fresh and there were generous portions of both along with jicama, avocado, and tomatoes. Afterwards, we split the French Dip with fries. The meat was so tender and delicious! Next time, I'll probably add cheese as I felt it was only missing a slight something. The fries were yummy and they tasted like they were seasoned with something sweet...unexpected but good none the less.\n\nOur server was Cara and she was great.She was very friendly without seeming fake and over the top. \n\nMy only problem is how to avoid going to Chelsea's Kitchen all the time as I've moved in right near by. I guess I'll need to remind myself that while it isn't unreasonably priced, it's not the cheapest either. Who knows if that will even stop me?"
2,"My fiance and I visited this spot on a Thursday evening around 8pm. Based on reviews, we were expecting a very positive experience. Although it was a little late for dinner there were still a handful of parties in the restaurant and many sounded like regulars...a good sign in our eyes.\n\nWe were seated in our requested booth and our server was very pleasant as she immediately brought us our tea/waters and took our order. We ordered 3 rolls and sashimi between us and an order of vegetable tempura. \n\nThe fish was of good quality and tasted very fresh. The balance of flavor in each roll was just right. One thing we noticed was how loosely the sushi was rolled. Each piece had the tendency to fall apart and trust, we know how to use chopsticks. The sushi just wasn't rolled up very tightly. Not a bad thing per se since it didn't affect the taste at all but just a tad annoying. \n\nThe other thing we noticed was how long it took for our sushi to arrive. Again, not necessarily a bad thing because we were enjoying dinner together but it still would have been nice to have some of our sushi come out earlier than the others so that we could eat and converse at the same time.\n\nAll in all, it's a quaint restaurant with good tasting sushi and a nice vibe. If we are in the area again and craving sushi we would probably go back."
1,"Insane long wait to get in, 4 cashiers for 200 people when we got there, each person taking 2-3 minutes to pay to enter.  I supervised tickets at the stampede, it usually takes 10 sec per person, if the computers are out maybe 30 sec, this took 2-3 min per person.\n\nI'd fire the person in charge of the entrance gates, it's insanely slow to get in.   2 hour wait.  If the day was hot people would be passing out from heat strokes.  Bonus: we didn't get a map of the gardens..."
3,"What a surprise!   Visited here on a Monday night with a group from work.  I too was a bit hesitant given the sushi and chinese menus, but we came anyway.  We started with drinks. $2 off pricing on most drinks, so those that did drink were pleased.\nWe went with a variety of apps.  Vegetable tempura, dumplings, and edemame. All were done well and gobbled up.   \nSeveral went with the shrimp tempura bento and could not finish-too much food. Large delicate shrimp, salad, rice, dumpling and california rolls.\nOthers got sushi, and enjoyed them all.  Tasty, fresh, and pleasing.\nDessert came and fried icecream, tempura oreos and tempura cheese cake- again great!\nLooking forward to coming back and trying the chinese menu, but may have to further explore the sushi menu first."
0,"One Star for the food.  \n\nService=ABSOLUTELY HORRRRRIBLE\nI KID YOU NOT!\n\nI am sorry but when the first time i go in to place a to go order for our office and it takes them over an hour to process our order and get it to us and only offer us \""NICE WATER\""(??????) I just thought to myself thats all you could do was offer us water??? It would be one thing if we were there to sit down and eat and had no time crunch to get food.  We are used to getting huge orders from taquitos jaliscos in like 30 min or less.  I didnt get any kind of apologies or anything from the managers walking around. Can we say unprofessional?  \n\nSo our second visit my BIRTHDAY.  We had a waitress with so much attitude she could make a room feel tense.  I will never return to this place after the stupid B****es wanted to eye down my mom like we had to be rushed out the door to leave just because the waitress' shift was over with. To top it off they didn't do anything like bring a dessert for my bday or anything. Not like that's the reason for my visit all I want is good food a decent enough service. If you can't provide both or 1.5 of those things bring me a dessert NAO!  I will stick to going to the phoenix location from now on.  Tempe location I hope you go out of business because of the horrendous service. It makes me so disgusted."
2,"Good Bahn Mi. Not great, but good."
2,"Dont get me wrong the food here is fantastic and if you eat in or pick up you cannot go wrong!\n\nThe delivery is usually decent but if there is an issue with your card, you have to wait longer than they promise to get your food!  They dont process cards online so they have to do it in the restaurant.  Its a little frustrating esepcially when they promise a specific time."
3,"Enjoyable meal!  I mean this is a niche fast food joint and reliably provides what one expects. I prefer the burrito bowl, seems healthier. Give it a try."
4,"Found this place on Yelp and decided to try it because of the good ratings.  THANK YOU yelp, I am so happy I came here.  Location is pretty small and tight so definitely expect a wait.  Everything we had on the menu was fresh and tasted sooooooo good.   The best part of this place is that it's very reasonable in price specially if you compare it to anywhere on the strip.   I have wasted so much money eating at Roku in Caesars and paying double the price for ok sushi.\n\nTip, it's worth sitting at the bar and talking to the sushi chefs.  They offered us some pretty incredible stuff that they didn't have on the menu like Salmon belly.  Also, save a little room for dessert.  Loved their green tea cream brulee.   Will definitely go back when I visit Vegas next."
4,"Something different, great bloody Mary bar and lots of fun."
2,"A while back a friend brought over a white pizza from some central Phoenix pizza establishment that made me change the way i looked at cheese. I've been searching for it ever since, which lead me to finally give Manhattan a try the other day.\n\nWhy did it take so long when it is just down the street from me? This place is super fucking creepy. Just driving by it gives me the heeby geebies. Looks like a waffle house without the sweet giant globe lights. Or truckers, or anybody. Where are the people? How does it stay in business? Drug front?\n\nI call and some woman mumbles into the phone like she is reacting to a soap opera. \n\n\""Ummm...is this manhattan pizzeria?\""\n\n\""Yes, take your order?\""\n\nNot a good start. I put in the order for the while pizza and they tell me it will be ready in 10. I give it closer to 20, and the pizza is still not ready, exactly what I had most feared. Me, alone, in the waffle-less waffle house and only my imagination to keep me company.\n\nThere is no decoration other then two old New York posters, no tv, no music, and no people except for the three immigrant workers speaking their eastern European dialect. \n\nThey all seem angry. They keep on sniping at each other with short, curt comments.  It's like I got stuck in one of those indie dramas about a depressing immigrant families that gets really high reviews but no one ever sees because they are boring as hell. Maybe you rent it and watch the first half, but you are going to fall asleep before the troubled teenage daughter commits suicide.\n\nThank the heavens when the santa-esque chef finally comes out with my pizza and gets me my tiramasu. I get the hell out of there as soon as possible before they start throwing pans at each other.\n\nAnd the result of my quest, pretty good pizza and tiramasu, but not mind-blowing like I hoped, and not worth the torture of sharing the immigrant drama.\n\nWill I ever find that white pizza or was someone just having a really good day when they made it?"
0,"This guy is the most arrogant, obnoxious, belittling, disregarding, supercilious, superior, snobbish, disdainful, lofty, haughty, smug, conceited \""doctor\"" in the valley. DO NOT GO TO HIM.\n\nDon't believe me? Read almost EVERY OTHER REVIEW on the internet about him."
4,"SPECTACULAR GINORMOUS club!! \n\nLove this place! Huge in door club with a million tables, outdoor tables. a pool, bar in the middle of the pool with card tables so if you go looking for your friends don't expect to find them b/c this place is soo packed and sooo big...like a needle in a haystack. Expect LONGGG lines! I went at alone to meet up with friends (miracle to find them) so I bypassed the long line by asking someone from bottle service to let me in...of course I paid the cover. They made it sound like it would be outrageous to pay....I was willing to pay any price to not wait in that ridiculous line...it was only $20. Heard it changes by the hour. \n\nGreat music and best club I experienced!"
4,"EARLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHeavenly hot sandwiches...and the bread...THE BREAD!!!!! So soft...yet crispy...\n\nSince I discovered Earl's about 2 trips ago, I've made eating at Earl's mandatory while in Vegas. I will pester my friends to go every other meal. For $6 a sandwich, it is an absolute STEAL. If the $6 price tag isn't enough to convince you to come, they are also DELICIOUS. The Original, Full Montagu...they're all FANTASTIC.\n\nAnd they're open 24/7! But it does tend to get crowded at peak eating hours.\n\nI have joked to my friends about opening up an Earl's franchise location in California...but little do they know I am not joking..."
1,Forgettable yogurt. Topping selection was good. Store is clean.  I will pass going here again because I think the yogurt is just average and there are too many other really good shops. \nStaff are just ok - one girl barely spoke to and acknowledged me.
1,"Well let me tell you. We  have stayed here twice before and had a very nice stay. This time was so different!   We got here no problem with check in. Got a good deal for staying here before. Paid a low price for one night, second night free. When we got to our room...very nice until I smelled smoke. I called the front desk to complain that I specifically asked for a non smoking room and there was an obvious smoke odor. She told me no problem will send someone to spray room to purify smell. That took 1 1/2 hours for someone to do that who was spraying for 5 seconds then leaves. It did help but we could still smell faint odors of smoke. At this point I didn't want them to come back to use an air purifier if the sprays didn't help. Had a great evening with my husband eating out and having fun...here in town to celebrate our 22nd anniversary.  Next morning,  left the room at 10 am, went out for the day, come back @4pm so we could get some rest then get ready to go to the top of the world restaurant and celebrate our anniversary.  We notice the need service sign we put on the door when we left was still there. We walk in and no one has come to clean our room! Very upset at this point.  I call and complain again...seriously  we were gone 6 hours and our room wasn't even cleaned? ???? I feel that is more than enough time for some one to clean up our room. I told them..forget it! Just bring me towels and toiletries...and someone actually came by in 10 minutes. What upsets me the most is that no one showed any care or concern. .they were just so matter of fact. No one said Sorry!!! I ended up canceling our reservation at the top of the world restaurant.  I spoke with Will who was the only one who gave me his name without asking,  offered to give me a later reservation and actually cared! I just said no thanks just need to cancel. I have been to the top of the world restaurant twice before and the staff and food were fabulous!  After all is said and done. ...what matters most is that I'm here in Las Vegas with my best friend and hubby of 22 years....just have to make the best of it. One thing for sure, will never stay at the Stratosphere again!"
1,The food was decent.i wouldn't put it any higher then two stars my drinks was watery and the chicken was cook uneven.but my sides were great the mash potatoes were good and the Mac and cheese was exceptional and the service well to be continued.
4,"This is a great venue. Every show is well-produced and the servers are excellent. From ushers to bartenders to security, everyone is polite and helpful.  Now, I did not enjoy Shania or Celine.  I recognize that I'm in the minority and that I should simply know better than to go to the \""dentist-elevator music\"" shows. Still, the shows were well-produced with nothing spared. Orchestras for Celine were top notch and Shania's animals were cute. Good job, Caesars."
0,"We were visiting Charlotte for a long weekend.  While driving around downtown Saturday night we found the center in which StrikeCity is located.  We were looking for something to do and thought bowling would be a lot of fun.\n\nThe hostess told us the wait would be an 1 hour and 30 minutes so we left our contact info and since we were in no particular rush we decided to have drinks at the bar while we waited.  Over 2.5 hours later we check back at the counter and it still wasn't our turn.  However, when glancing at the list all the names before us and after us had been scratched off.  When I confronted the hostess she informed me that those were all cancellations - SURE...  It wasn't until I stood at the counter for service that we were able to get a lane.\n\nOnce we started bowling we enjoyed the experience but due to the HORRIBLE service we won't be back."
0,"I come here all the time for years and sadly the service and food have now consistently been horrendous. I have returned food to the kitchen several times, it was either wrong, freezing cold or torn wraps and burger buns. Attitude sank to such bitchy lows, no quality control, a new menu that is just retarded and over priced. I will not return to this place ever again, me and my crew of 6 regulars have all agreed this place went to hell and is run by 15 year old children that don't give a damn about no one but their friends that come in after high school and get free drinks."
4,"By far the best Korean restaurant in Las Vegas!  If you don't believe me just watch the first episode of season 2 of \""The Great Food Truck Race\"" on the Food Network.  When one of the food trucks needs to get their hands on the best Kimchi in Vegas, where do they turn?  Mothers!\nBesides their spicy pork (which is phenomenal!) I would also recommend their haemul pajeon (seafood pancake) and their seafood soondubuchigae (spicy soft tofu stew).\nThe only improvement I might add would be to put in some charcoal grills for us old school Korean BBQ'ers.  Besides that, I will probably not be going to any other Korean restaurants in Vegas in Mother's price category - I would just be wasting my money on lesser quality food."
2,Extremely friendly service like a sushi restaurant. But you have to really like Ramen because that's about all they have. And it just didn't seem like the food was easy to get excited about.
4,"When I'm eating the ethnic specialties of a foreign culture, I try to just shut up and let the natives tell me how to eat it - what condiments I should use, the mechanicals of eating it, what temperatures and tastes are best. Well, Paradise Valley Burger Company's cooks are natives of Burger Country and we are just visiting, so you should shut up and let them tell you how to eat their burgers. These guys are friggin burger wizards and I am completely enthralled by their flavor magic. Always ask about the weekly special. One time I came in and the weekly special was two thin patties, battered and fried, bacon on top and bottom, collard greens with garlic, and a maple-bacon-sriracha aioli on top of waffles.  WAFFLES.  Good God.  I almost wish I had died because I'm never going to eat anything that good ever again.\n\nThe one thing I could complain about is that their seasoned fries are way too salty."
3,I shopped for a used car for months and couldn't really find any dealership that wanted to help due to my bad credit. Carlos helped me get into a really nice used Chevy Tahoe. Had a few little things wrong with it but they fixed all the little things and I'm thankful! If your looking for a nice used car or truck just stop by and see these guys! You won't be sorry trust me
0,"The first time i went to this bar I was satisfied with the service. The staff were friendly and attentive. I was at the bar playing video poker. My drinks and food were both comped as I played for a few hours. Then the second and third time I went the bartending staff were rude and appeared as if they were doing me a favor by pouring me a drink while I was sticking money into their machines. The third visit two of us were playing on the same machine for at least three hours continuously and they only comped us one drink each. The bartender was talking to what appeared to be her friends sitting next to me not playing on a machine and was comping their drinks - probably with my play! When I asked about their comping procedure, the bartender was rude and just walked away. I payed for my drinks with exact change and no tip. I will never go back there! They shouldn't advertise themselves as a gaming bar when they actually are trying to be a club - with club priced drinks - that is sponsored by people who play."
0,"This is not a corporate store but a third party store so they feel free to lie. Nothing is free when you make your purchase today as you will find when you get your next bill from sprint. Don't fall for the upgrade today and you get a free speaker or battery pack. You are better off going to a real sprint store or sprint.com. Have been with sprint 15 years but will never go to a third party sprint store again. This was the worst experience I have had with sprint and tell everyone I can to avoid this store, if sprint is lucky this location will be out of business sooner than later"
0,The management does not seek professional services when dealing with maintenance issues to keep operating costs low. This has caused a health issue with flooded carpet and pad in the unit. Totally mishandled. Staff seems to have difficulty keeping you updated on what is going on with maintenance issues.\n\nEvery place has issues I understand but this frequently is a bit rediculous
0,No one to help at all. Best part was the fitting rooms. Not a single one was clean anywhere in the men's department. Seriously look at the picture.
2,"11/25/11\n\nAfter checking out a movie at AMC and a bit of shopping at Northlake, the rest of the family wanted to grab a bite.  On our way to Friday's, a nephew mentioned Steak 'n Shake, which went over well w/ the adults, since it was cheaper than the original choice of Friday's, and me, since I felt like having something sweet!  The wait was moderate, but it was Black Friday, after all...\n\nManager asked if we minded getting two tables pulled together, and we said \""no problem.\""  We ended up sitting in two booths, across a foot path and adjacent from each other...  Two of the children ordered a steak burger and chicken fingers, both w/ fries.  Mom had a cup of chili w/ onions and cheese, and I ordered a strawberry milkshake to share.  Kids enjoyed their meals, Mom thought the chili http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?select=hbKt52iPDQduRiz1huRszQ was mediocre (\""the chili at the Sam Adams bar in that airport was much better!\""), and I thought that the milkshake http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA was too sweet.  We stopped halfway, and I decided I'd order my original choice of Hershey Special Dark.  This was much better-- not very sweet!  Nice that this also came w/ a few chocolate chips sprinkled on top... \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CDP1ghXEqVTKrxQnA3BYpA?select=Jj17ry6dfdmjRpa3eh2Ogg\n\nHad to remind our server of the kids' forgotten mini-shakes.  An order of onion fries arrived that no one ordered-- very cool of the manager to offer it to us, anyway!  (That's how it should be, btw... rather than serving up soggy fries to the intended guest or throwing them away.)  Seems like everyone deemed the meal satisfactory.\n\nMaybe next time I can check out other menu items..."
4,"I always passed by this place and wanted to try it.  So one evening, we called and asked what time they were closing.  They had just closed at 7pm. But the lady was so nice, she asked us what we wanted and said we could go pick it up since we told her we were disappointed it was closing and it was our first time.\n\nWhen we pulled up to the place, it was really nice inside.  Very clean and spacious.  The outside and inside of the restaurant was well kept and there were some artists painting murals on the wall inside.  The lady who answered the phone was making our tortas and had everything ready within a few minutes.\n\nWe didn't want to wait until we got home, so we ate the tortas in the car.  They were delicious.  The bread was so soft and the beef was cooked perfectly.  We will definitely come back again, and hopefully next time get there before they close so we can eat in the restaurant instead of our car."
2,"I've been meaning to pop into the Grind House for quite a while. After reading a 'quick tip' on my Yelp app about how big the BLT's were, and hearing all about their coffee being some of the best this end of town, I finally stopped by for lunch on a Sunday (most other places were shut - what's up with that?!)\n\nIt's quite plain inside with rows of tables and chairs. Maybe lacking a little personality in style, but the baristas and waitress certainly made up for that. They were very cheery with a genuine warm smile on their face. I was potentially their most awkward customer of the day. I took the soup and sandwich deal, but asked for just half a sandwich. Ok. And then asked if I could switch up some of the ingredients so there were olives instead of cheese on my sandwich. Again, ok. Sweet smile and was told it's not normal but they'd go ahead. I like this sort of personalisation and customer service.\n\nThe food took a wee while to come out, but I think it's because the bacon (on my friend's chicken and bacon sandwich) was grilled fresh - so no complaints. The soup was a little watery and underwhelming. I like hearty big broths and prefer chunks of veg rather than blended. Nothing spectacular.\n\nThe bread was fresh and cut very thick. My houmous, mediteranean veg and olive half-sandwich was oooook. THe ingredients were certainley tasty but because the bread was so thick the ratio of bread-to-filling was skewed and I ended up taking the top slice off and just cutting it up.\n\nHowever, another dining partner's ham and cheese toastie looked and smelled really delicious. So I'd perhaps recommend the toasted sandwiches over the dry bread sandwiches.\n\nIt was nice here, there is free wifi and I probably will come back but there wasn't anything in particular to write home about. Really really friendly staff though!"
1,"The food was good. Server dropped off bill before we were halfway thru our meal celebrating my wife's birthday. Since when do you get the bill before you are asked about desert? She said that we were to use the table kiosk to pay our bill and we could order deserts there, too. After receiving the bill server never came back to see if we needed an additional napkin or to have our drinks refilled. If you are too busy to give service to your customers you will not have customers. It is not like we were dining at McDonals's or Burger King. With all of the choices out there I would recommend any place else."
0,"After seeing the response from the manager/owner I feel compelled to update. \n\nLook, I'm not insulting your customers, I'm insulting your food. Actually, the description I gave was more a compliment because I could have been a lot more brutal. \n\nIt's kind of like The Varsity in Atlanta. If you like greasy burgers in cheap white buns, somewhat  average chili over an even more average hot dog, then it's your place! The place has been around for years and it has a loyal band of Georgia Tech alumni that would swear by nothing else. To them, it's comfort food and brings back memories of their school days - and that's great. It's been around for 50 years and it'll be there another 50 years... It doesn't change the fact that the food is crap but their customers will rave about how great it is. \n\nI think it must be the same with your place. You have loyal customers, for whatever reason, but don't even begin to pretend that you're dishing out good Italian food, because you're not. Well, not to me you aren't. I'm comparing it to Italian food that I know to be good. I've been all over the world - including Italy - and I know the difference. Your food is no different to what you would get out of a Stouffers box or at an Olive Garden."

1,"My husband and I had visited once before when they first opened.  We were not particularly impressed but we wanted to return because they were new then and we wanted to give them time to figure things out.  We enjoy drinking and truly appreciate the talent behind a craft cocktail.  We were elated to see a craft cocktail and wine bar in Tempe.  I had the Lavender Lemon Fizz and it would have been a great drink with much less lavender syrup.  He had the Manhattan which specified on the menu that it came with Carpano Antica sweet vermouth.  It did not.  It also said it came with an Amarena Cherry but it was just a maraschino.  Craft cocktail descriptions and classic Mill bar execution.  Decorations and atmosphere are great and food has been good each time, but drinks are lacking.  Would return, but would have to switch to wine or beer."
1,"Why is the service sooo bad right now?!  Food is always decent, but come on. 4 tables, been here for 20 min, still haven't ordered. Cool guys. \n\nOk, the new waiter came in and prompted an edit. This guy is great, but the first girl... Wooowwwww"
2,"This place is bizarre. Many great qualities alongside not so good ones, hence my middle of the road 3 star rating. First of all the location... it is in what can only be described as a strip mall, in the back of the parking lot. If you are looking for a landmark to spot it, be on the lookout for the restaurant Twin Peaks (whole other story... it is not named after two mountain tops as the logo suggests). When you walk in, the lobby has a modern, clean updated feel with a great little cafe that serves starbucks coffee and also alcoholic beverages. There is no room service so at least there is something that serves good food and drinks easily accessible. In the room, I was pleased to see that there are electrical outlets very clearly accessible on the wall above the nightstand. Finally a hotel that understands people charge their cell phones overnight and keep them next to them while they sleep... what a concept! I am normally THAT person who pulls out the nightstand and unplugs everything from the outlet behind it so I can plug my phone in. Nice not to have to do that. I thought the amenities were sub-par. For one, there was no lotion. What? Small bottles of Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner but no lotion. IT IS FREAKING ARIZONA where if you don't moisturize your skin will basically just fall off. In all fairness I did not call the front desk to ask for it. But in my opinion I should not have to ask. I appreciated that there was a fridge but it emitted a very strange odor. I couldn't quite place it but it just smelled off. The hair dryer barely put out any heat or force so it took forever to dry my hair. There was no rack to put your luggage on. The bathroom did not have an exhaust fan. The thermostat had to be wrong. We had to set it to 65 degrees so it was comfortable but there is no way the air temperature was actually 65 degrees. I did not go to the gym but I was told there was 1 machine. On the plus side, the bed was very comfortable with what felt like a tempurpedic top. Even though the location was bizarre it did come in handy to have so many shops and food options within walking distance. I traveled here on business so I did not have to pay the hotel out of pocket. If I did, I would not choose to stay here again."
4,Like this steak house a lot \nNever had a bad meal. Reasonably priced. \nGood variety of bread. Quality drinks. Great steaks. French onion soup and lobster bisque outstanding. Reservation needed on weekends.
2,"Only reason why I'm giving Harrah's 3 stars is because of the location. On the strip. Checked in on a Tuesday. Yes 9:30pm. Called 3 times that day to make sure I had a double non smoking. I understand they can't guarantee rooms but when I call at 7pm, tell me you don't have that room anymore. Got to hotel, had a king only. Miraculously a double NS came open but had to clean. Fine I'll wait \""1 hour\"". More like 2. My reservation said $0 deposit but wanted to charge me $400. More than my hotel bill. ATM wouldn't take 8 digit pin. Mac of 6. Night manager, Antonio, had zero customer service skills. Asked where bank was located bc I have an 8 digit pin. His response \""you have an 8 digit pin?\"" Sarcastically like I was making it up. Received 2 dinner buffet passes that closed at 10pm. Used later and have to say the Flavors buffet was awesome!  That's the only highlight. Reservation was for 8 days. Told front desk on Wednesday about tub being backed up and slow drain. Told them again on Thursday, fri, sat, sun. Decided to check out early on Monday. Went to let front desk know on Sunday we were leaving on Monday instead of Wednesday. Didn't even ask why!  Check out is at 11am. Monday at 10am maintenance guy BANGS on door and NOW wants to come fix. Told him we were leaving within the hour. He gets on the radio and like a kid says \""the guests said they don't want me in the room\"". Huh?  Main sup calls and asks what the problem was. Really?!!  Told them they were about 5 days too late and we will be leaving shortly. Checked out and Slyvia did comp our resort fees only after charging the full amount to card. She was really nice but shouldn't a manager know how to work the computer system?  Stella, who was helping people at the front and handing out water was the most polite one there!  Like I said customer service at Harrah's is something they obviously do not take pride in. Went to different hotel on the strip and couldn't be more pleased!"
1,"While visiting Vegas, we decided to give their chicken & waffles a try. While waiting to be seated we could see the HUGE portions. My husband was disappointed that their chix n waffles only came with chix breast. He decided to only get a bacon waffle & try some of my chix. When the food arrived it looked incredible, but the chix was bland & lacked flavor. The waffles we ok but nothing great.\n\nI'm not sure if we would go back next time we visit Vegas."
1,"This was my first experience in Vegas, & I wish to come back to experience a better hotel. The Casino was fine, but check in was HORRIBLE. The hotel check in is right in the middle of the casino & it took us an hour and a half in line with a small dog (the place is dog friendly, whoopee!) to even check in, & we called & reserved before-hand. The unique thing about the Quad is it's an overflow hotel for 4 other major hotels, Flamingo, MGM, Caesars & somewhere else.....it used to be the old Imperial Palace & you can tell, they kept most of the same decor sans some fun new posters...parking was a nightmare & they shut down most of the parking lot for no reason whatsoever...the layout of the hotel is confusing as all heck & if I was drunk coming back to my hotel room, I definitely would be getting lost. I rated 2 stars because the Japanese restaurant in the place is AWESOME & open 24hrs, but everything else is quite lackluster. The \""celebrity\"" performers were pretty interesting....while I suffered in line. Figure out a better queue & put some money into your overflow hotel, guys!!! Price was $90 for two people & a small pet ($100 refunded pet deposit), meh."
0,"Absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department.  Overcharged four months in a row, called every month and was repeatedly told it would be fixed.  I went to American Express to file a dispute and at least they were able to reverse the four overcharges.  Even after that, I was randomly charged for a system upgrade that never happened.  I am considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau and the attorney general."
1,"This was the second time I visited this place. I should have learned the first time. I wanted breakfast, a onion, ham and cheese Omelette with a side of sausage. I  was given a coffee and my breakfast was out quicker than a muffin at McDonald's.  The sausages were cold and I sent them back it then took ten minutes for them to come back. I'd finished my breakfast by then. No offer of coffee top up. Got the cheque and left. Maybe I've just been unlucky with my service both time. Don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."
4,"I absolutely love this hotel! It is now my home away from home in Las Vegas! \n\nI just recently stayed in one of their Bella Suites with a few of my girls, and experienced the best service ever! All of the employees are wonderful, and treat you like royalty. I especially love how they give personalized service. For example, whenever I called for more towels, they would say, \""Good afternoon Ms. Lee, how can i help you today? ..... Alright no problem, is there anything else i can get you Ms. Lee?\"" \n\nBesides the top notch service, The Venetian is located in a great spot if you're looking to hit up the nightclubs at Encore, Wynn, or inside The Venetian. You can save, by just walking over as opposed to spending money on a cab. The pool and jacuzzis are also very nice. There are also multiple jacuzzis if you want your own for your group. \n\nThere are many food choices inside the hotel / casino. My favorite is Grand Lux Cafe for a quick lunch or dinner; their burgers are the best and they're also open 24/7. And definitely join the Grazie club if you're going to gamble. As a perk for being a new member, I got $25 free slot credit to play with! \n\nAll in all, you may pay a bit more to stay in The Venetian, but it is definitely worth it for the primo location on the strip as well as outstanding service. I will definitely be staying here again!"
4,"This place really lived up to our expectations.  We love going to teppan grill style restaurants and we have a favorite one back home in California.  So on vacation in Vegas we decided to try this place out.  It was just as good as our place back home and priced about the same.  Our chef, hurricane pho, was awesome and fun.  Would definitely recommend the teppan grill to anyone looking for good affordable food in Vegas."
0,I'm extremely upset with Corleone's. I waited 2 hours for my delivery order and he didn't have change that I really needed. They lost a loyal customer
4,"The staff is very friendly. I brought my car in for some breaks work. There was no up-selling and they were done about a half hour earlier than the estimate they initially provided. I cannot remember the last time that happened. They did a full inspection, and there were some suggestions about other work that should be done, but there was no pressure from them to have it done then. The price was far below what I was expecting considering how bad my car was sounding at the time."
0,"Visited last night with a group of business associates and were hugely disappointed. Service was solicitious but untrained. Food was downright marginal, and all the steaks came dredged in sauce. Simply awful, and outrageously expensive. I cannot recommend for any reason."
4,I was on a business trip in Las Vegas and a good friend took me to Zaytoon to enjoy a Persian meal. I enjoyed the hot bread at Zaytoon served for appetizer and the casual ambiance of the restaurant with beautiful decorations. I recommend this place to all people who love good food at a reasonable price plus great Middle Eastern food that Zaytoon market offers.
0,"Jesus did my hair. I hadn't realized he was brand new.\n\nThe haircut itself was fine. He did ask a lot of questions like where should the top layer start,  end, etc which was a little unsettling since he's the \""professional\""...\n\nAt one point,  the conversation became unprofessional and then he answered his phone while cutting my hair! What?! Of course that was when he was cutting my bangs. They look awful. I asked him to fix it and he didn't know how. I like the rest of my haircut but c'mon my bangs is all people can see and focus on.\n\nSuggestions on where I can go to fix them?"
4,"Simply the best Sushi, been coming here for years.  The staff is always Awesome, and take great care of you. No question it's our family favorite place for all occasions."
2,"Can't tell you my disappointment at the poor wifi that Scotrail made a big thing of when they introduced it on the Edinburgh to Glasgow shuttle. Hurrah, I thought, at least i can now do lots of work on the 45 minute journey and send emails (or more likely, read Twitter and Facebook!).\n\nBut nah! In the whole three-quarters of an hour, I could barely even detect a signal and the one time it did find it and connect, it dropped out after about 30 seconds.\n\nMaybe I was just on an old train or a bad one or in the wrong carriage because I know some people have enjoyed wifi but not for me. It would be interesting to know if other people have found the \""sweet spot\"" on trains ...\n\nThat said, I'd still rather commute to Glasgow in comfort on a train rather than a megabus!"
2,"It's not the best pho I've had, or even good. I'd probably rate it as mediocre pho to be honest, however the service is actually fast and straightforward. I do like the $1 option for extra noodle and I think $3 for extra meat. Prices are also a little higher than I've seen at other pho places, but it's certainly not overpriced or bad.\n\nIt's decent for the location since it's very close to the strip in an open strip mall and there is also a big wide area for seating. I didn't try the sandwiches though, but I was in a mood for noodles. Perhaps next time."
4,"Sweet Jesus!  Checker pool and pump rocks.  Exactly the kind of place my  (ex) pool boy hoped I'd never find.  Good prices (free advice) and friendly, honest service.  Eat your heart out paddock, I'll see you at checkers!"
2,"Beautiful dining room in the architecturally stunning Mint Museum in downtown Charlotte. Arrived early on a Friday with no reservations and were seated immediately. Spacious, woodsy seating space with ample room to settle in for a good catch-up with an old friend.\nThe staff seemed new and somewhat overwhelmed with designer foodie terms. Wine list was reasonably priced and had a good representation of regions to accompany local farm to table fare. \nWe had a few questions as to the local cheeses which turned out to be from elsewhere but our server explained they used local merchants for products not available regionally or seasonally.\nShared a trio of cheeses to start and split the short rib with slight side of creamy mashed potatoes and vegetable cubes of what looked like root veggies. The serving of meat was huge for one person so we left perfectly content.\nRecommended for large and small groups (the largest dining room table being a slice of an ancient tree - beautiful).\nIt had a few kinks to work out in service, chipped plates and wobbly tables but once they get a little more time in food tasting/training and attention to detail, they'll likely be around for a good long while."
2,"After looking at all my options, I decided to go to Sammy's. \n\nThe service was exceptional. I was immediately greeted, and the bar tender was awesome with refilling my drink, and taking my order in a timely manner.\n\nI ordered a breakfast burrito, which was average tasting. I can't say it was the best, or worst I've ever had.\n\nFor being in the airport, I felt the price was pretty reasonable.\n\nNext time I'm at the airport, I may chose a different option. Only to compare with the experience I had.\n\nWould I eat here again? Yes! \n\nThe food wasn't horrible, clean and inviting atmosphere, and great service. \n\nHad the food been a little better, and the price been a little lower.... I would have given them 4 or 5 stars."
0,"The one star in my review is for the quick smile and greeting we received immediately upon entering. After saying hello, the hostess asked if we had a reservation. \""Nope,\"" I replied, \""just wanted to stop in.\"" She then asked if we would prefer to sit at a table or the bar. \""A table would be great,\"" I said. \""Well,\"" responded the hostess, \""we're very busy tonight (which I totally got, I mean, the bar and the dining room were completely empty), so we do ask that you be respectful of that.\"" Excuse me??? \""I'm sorry, I don't understand?\"" I asked, looking for clarification. \""Oh, never mind. Would you prefer a table or a booth?\"" Umm, how about neither. Sorry lady, not so confident the food at this establishment will wash away that bad taste you just put in my mouth. Maybe I was just really hungry and easily irritable, but that's enough to put me off this place for a good long while. In the meantime, guess I'll just hop over to the reliable Chinatown when I'm in the mood for Asian goodness."

1,"The Good: Can't go wrong with outlet prices, with lower tax (compared to cali) it's a nice place to buy without costing too too much. The store has relatively newer items compared to the Primm outlet store with saffiano items in display.\n\nThe bad: the store is always packed with people and there's not so much of a walking space either. \n\nThe Ugly: CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. Yes it's all caps because it's the only way I can make my words come across with the horrid customer service they have. I had purchased something from the Primm for mother's day, decided to take a quick peek at this store and I decided another bag would be better suited for my mommy. Lo and behold when I was discussing this issue with the guy at the register. He was just so standoffish and not accommodating at all. Standing at the register for more 20 minutes or so without any update of what the hell is going on. When the return/exchange was almost complete he said he couldn't credit back the remaining balance, so I had to look for something close to the balance account. When I told him I needed time to look around and decide he just gave me a look and a sigh of being annoyed. Well, sorry to be such a nuisance mister. But I AM a paying customer you know. He could've said those terms while I was standing there for 20 mins doing nothing. Not going back here ever again."
4,Great environment! Really great food! I live right around the corner and will definitely becoming back! Thank you! Tip: order the deviled eggs..soooo delicious!
2,"For my 100th Yelp review, I have chosen a place that features one of my favorite things to do in life-play golf.  I was really looking forward to this round, having seen a number of excellent reviews.  Yes, it's in the middle of summer and scorching in Vegas, but I figured I could keep hydrated and tough it out.  Plus, the deal on GolfNow was great.  \n\nSo I get to the pro shop and Jose, who was simply awesome for letting my wife ride along complimentary, tells us that the course is shutting down in two days for two weeks because of re-seeding-thus the discount on GolfNow. Anyway, the course is situated in the most beautiful part of the Las Vegas area, near Red Rock. We get out to the first tee and you can see that the fairways are dried out and grated in preparation for the re-seeding.  I figured, no biggie, golf is golf.  \n\nSo we played if a ball landed in a spot that was chewed up due to maintenance, we could move it.  Yes, it is a tough course, lots of hazards.  Very nice, typical desert course. LOTS of sand traps, especially protecting a lot of the greens.  Not the best desert course I have ever seen, but nice.  The best thing, to me, was the personal instruction on each hole from Jack on the GPS.  Absolutely great idea and something I had never seen before. My big negative was that there were so many holes he used from the same courses throughout this course. For example, he used holes from Desert Highlands in Arizona a number of times. I actually anticipated 18 absolutely different holes and maybe to someone who is into golf architecture could see that, but I didn't see it that way.  Yes, there were some very distinct holes here, but not enough.  Can't remember which hole it was, but there was a split fairway on one that was similar to one at PGA West.  Great setup.  But just not enough of those.\nGreens were okay, not too difficult yet not easy whatsoever. However, not enough people are repairing their divots.  Is this because they know the course is closing for maintenance?  Lazy bums.\n\nMost amateurs like me should play this course from no longer than the blues, it is more than 7,000 from the gold.  But from Jose in the pro shop, which is small but nice, to Edwin, who was so nice and respectful and helpful, everyone we met was terrific and treated us very well.  And thanks to truck driver Tom of North Carolina for the awesome company and great round of golf. Be safe out there.\n\nI would give this 4 stars if not for the condition of the course. I am absolutely willing to give this course another shot, but I think I will wait until the fairways are green again.  Like in the spring."
3,"4.5 stars.\nFriends and I were in Tucson and headed over to Tombstone, but before we got there we stopped for some breakfast. I hate eggs, so I got the cheesy potato casserole with cinnamon apple side with a biscuit! So yummy. So southern. Made me melt inside. Too bad I live in California. I'd embrace it in a heart beat. My friends enjoyed their respective breakfasts as well. Gotta stop for some old time candy on your way out!! \n\nCome to California Cracker Barrel!!"
3,Le restaurant est superbe!\nD\u00e9finitivement la meilleure bouffe mexicaine que j'ai eu l'occasion de manger.\nNous avons commencer avec la guacamole qui est pr\u00e9par\u00e9e devant nous. Vraiment excellent! Portion parfaite \u00e0 partager pour deux personnes en entr\u00e9e. Attention \u00e0 la sauce aux ghost peppers!\nLe service est un peu brusque.... Disons que le plat principal arrive avant que nous ayons eu le temps de nous remettre de notre entr\u00e9e...\nLe service est typiquement am\u00e9ricain mais la nourriture est des plus mexicaine.\nUne valeur s\u00fbre bien qu'un peu cher.
3,"Okay it's not anything fancy but a family owned take out Chinese. However I love how fast their pickup and delivery is!    And flavor is strong. I eat their Kung pao chicken and ma po tofu every week :)\n\nHot and sour soup is good too. But I especially love their mapo tofu, no meat , very simple but love the flavor :)\n \nThey lose one star as take out Chinese food because sometimes their flavor is not consistent and they always don't put fork when I do delivery but other wise my Togo takeout !"
2,"Eh it was ok, not as amazing as everyone tells me it is. When I lived in Vegas everyone would say if Chick-Fil-A was here Raisin Cane's would be put to shame...HAHAHA yeah right! I am glad I tried this now because nothing here stacks up to it. The Chicken was really solid could tell it was fresh cut before fried. But it just was lacking in flavor. The sauce was not inspiring but OK. ( I did take 8 packs home to Seattle with me) But it was nothing like the Canes sauce. The Sweet Tea was even disappointing vs Raising Canes. Overall compared to other fast foods it is better than most. But, I only eat fast food if it is outstanding and this was not it."
1,"I know you can't fault a casino for taking all of your money. That's like punching a bottle of Beefeater because it made you drink it. However. Treasure Island not only took all of my blackjack money in the quickest series of hands I've ever seen but the dealers have zero personality. Zero. Zilch. Keine.\n\nI will happily hand you $60 if you entertain my pants off while dealing me twelve 14's in a row and I fold on every ... single ... one. I will dance and clap my hands like a stupid monkey while doing it. But since every single dealer at TI sat there like a corpse and didn't even talk or smile while sweeping away my hard-earned chips which I definitely didn't take out of my college tuition fund, then I simply won't enjoy it. Not a laugh or a joke or even a smile. Is Treasure Island owned by Disney? The card dealers are all animatronic. No. No. They're Dementors. They suck the very soul out of you, and there ain't even a cocktail waitress around to help ease the pain.\n\nTI, I rather don't like you at all."
1,"Worked at the office today and for lunch I originally wanted to go to China Inn but it was closed. It was either the Hard Rock or Stoudemire's. Guess you know where I ate. \nI ordered yellow squash soup and half a grilled chicken club sandwich for $9 and my coworker order the beer battered fish and chips for $11. \nI think they were trolling for the fish and chasing the chicken 'cause almost 25 minutes had gone by before our order was brought to us. The fish looked like chicken drumettes because there was a lot of batter on it; served with waffle fries and a tablespoon of cole slaw. My soup was okay, not hot, good texture but a little bland. My sandwich was okay. The only thing I did not like was the top slice of bread was crisp and the bottom WET!!! .UGH!!! I HATE damp bread!!! Our waitress must have forgotten our order and it must have sat on the counter for who knows how long.\nIt will be sometime before I patronize this restaurant again."
0,"hey, just wanted to give some feedback.  if i'm noticing this, i'm sure other customers are as well.  \nin the last month, not only has service but also food quality has declined drastically.\nwe are regulars and the last 3 weeks the pizzas have been either overcooked or over oiled.  i've seen a few times where you've had customers with allergies have to continually tell the pie makers to clean their gloves or refrain from cross contaminating.  your pie makers should know proper handling for allergens since your restaurant boasts about the ability to compensate.  it would be pretty awful if someone got sick.\nmost recently my pizza was an oily mess.  it was a gross-pearfect.  the prep area was disgusting, salami in the chicken bin, fresh mozzarella had all sorts of crap in it.  the sense of pride has declined drastically as has the cleanliness.\nwe are seriously contemplating refraining from coming again."
2,"We went here for Breakfast Buffet on a Monday morning because we wanted to ride the roller coaster and I knew this restaurant would not be busy.  It wasn't and we were seated right away.\n\nThe buffet is a blend of American breakfast items and a few Chinese items.  I was disappointed there weren't more Chinese items on the buffet but it was still pretty darned good.\n\nAmerican:  Fruit, waffles, scrambled eggs, bacon (good), link sausage (good, large, delicious).\n\nChinese:  Egg rolls, Fried rice, and BBQ Pork that was REALLY good.\n\nService was fairly good.  Food was hot.  A tad spendy but not bad for Vegas.\n\nNot a destination but good if you're nearby."
0,"why by a mac when you can by food cheap elswhere that keeps you full for longer and doesn't support a multi national.\ntry a local cafe,you might be surprised and find something different."
4,"We keep coming back to this place every time we are in Vegas. From the drinks to the dessert , perfection. The bone in ribeye is the best steak we have ever had ! The wine list is extensive . We had the grilled octopus appetizer and it was so tender. We chose sides of roasted beets which were juicy and the decadent mashed potatoes. Every bite of the ribeye was heaven on earth. The homemade gelato - I had pumpkin spice - was the perfect ending to this dining experience. The service is second to none, friendly without being stuffy. I love it when I learn things about food from the staff and they are well versed in all aspects of the choices on the menu. Worth every penny spent there !"
2,"We checked this place out on a Friday morning. Its in a kinda dodgy industrial area but really no biggie. Easy to find just off the frontage road and a huge sign where to park and where to walk in. I told the girl at the counter it was our first visit and she went through all the info. She was very nice and super helpful.  \nThey have a pamphlet that has all their products outlined and prices (awesome!). You decide what items you'd like and give it back to them, then they pull it. You are not able to just walk around looking at produce in the warehouse (which I admit was my anticipation) She said if we would like to see anything specific, one of the guys would take us to the product and then back up to the front. \n-During the week Monday-Friday you can only buy items BY THE CASE. This is VERY IMPORTANT to know if your visiting for the first time. \n-They do a Farmers Market on Saturday Mornings and that is the only time they offer items to be sold individually. (EX 1 head of lettuce VS 1 Case of lettuce)\n-The prices are extremely reasonable and if your into juicing this is your place! (as you go thru fruits & Veggies like crazy).\n-If your order is over 100.00 they offer free delivery! \n-Lastly, this is where Bountiful Baskets gets all of their products. I've done BB before and liked it, but I would much rather pick my own products weekly.\n-If you're smart, get a couple people to go in on an order and have them deliver it to you and split it up yourselves. The savings is worth it. \n\nI hope this is helpful to others!! I had a ton of questions and wasn't really able to get many answers, so I thought I would share some key details for those interested. I only did a 3 star rating because I haven't placed an order yet, but will be this weekend so I'll update then :)"
1,"Ugh this place blows, but I guess I should explain myself.\n2 pm, rolled out of bed and walked across the street to stuff burgers in my face and get ready for Vegas Round Dos.  I must have needed to stay in bed a little longer because I ordered the shrimp bucket (SICK) thinking it was \""just what I wanted\"".  It was so gnarly when it came.. the shrimp weren't cleaned, cooked, or edible, but I decided I came this far and I'd give it a go.  GOO!  They tasted even crazier than they looked and when I sent the dish back the waiter made a good point - why would I order fish in the middle of the desert?  While this was thought-provoking and very true, I have always believed that restaurants should stand behind everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on their menus.  Thus I am giving Stripburger two stars for making me want to commit suicide over a bucket of shrimp, while taking my own responsibility for ordering the most repulsive thing offered and giving them the benefit of the doubt.. I'm sure their burgers are just fine."
4,"After 3 years in Vegas this is my favorite restaurant, I love the spinach curry, tofu salad and curry pan. The prices are incredibly affordable, every time we come we are shocked to see how low the bill is. My kids love that they can pick a la carte."
0,"I wanted to like this place and give local business a boost, but the guy that works here (and possibly owns it) is crazy rude. I was considering buying an item, but decided to hold off for the moment, and he seemed to take it personally. As our interaction came to a close, he then came around the counter to solely move my bike 3 ft away to another location in the store and turned it around to face the door, to which I apologized if my bike was in the way, and he said he did it 'because [he is] just OCD.' Again, I wanted to give this place my business, but I didnt have a great feeling about this. The only thing he didn't do was show me the door. I'd rather take my business elsewhere."
2,"I'm amazed I haven't reviewed this place yet since I go here so often, strange. \n\nAnywho, I'm knocking it down a couple of stars because of the last time Matt & I dined here. \n\nGot seated quickly inside, and made our orders after getting our drinks. I got the bowl of lentil soup sans cheese and a falafel pita with hummus and fries. Matt got the unlimited pasta bowl, and his first round was bowtie pesto. \n\nService was alright although our waitress was a total ninja and disappeared a lot so if we actually did need things it would have been very difficult to find her. \n\nMy food was very good, although I think that the soup is a bit overpriced but still very yummy. I'm not a fan of their hummus at all but when it's wrapped inside the pita it's good, and the fries are always bits of pure heaven. Matt however, wasn't a fan of his pasta and had half of the big bowl left. He still wanted a second bowl of something different, and asked if I could take the rest of the pesto home as leftovers since he didn't like it. The waitress said due to policy they can't box up the first round of pasta. \n\nOkay, I would understand if Matt didn't completely finish his second bowl and kept asking for to-go boxes, but come on. I can't believe that they just wasted all of that food that I would have gladly ate for lunch the next day. They need to change the policy that you can only take home one portion or something. That policy just totally puts me off from coming back as soon as I usually do. \n\nOverall the experience was alright but wasting that food is upsetting. I guess from now on we won't be so adventurous with our first bowl. The food is always good usually though and the service is alright (although I can tell you a funny story about a waitress who kept blindly spilling water on my friend throughout the night - too hilarious) but I don't think I'll be back for awhile."
2,Kalbi Ribs was good and the Garlic Chicken was ok. They give you two very small scoops of rice so I had to order a extra scoop. The macaroni salad had no taste and would suggest putting a little salt and pepper to make it eatable!
4,"First time here and it will definitely not be my last time. My friend and I came here to watch the Saints and Niners game. Its seat yourself,  but we wanted to ait at the bar. The bar is very with an excellent selection of drinks and beers on tap. The atmosphere is light and relaxing. It had a nice and mixed crowd.  The staff were friendly and attentive. They also would engage a friendly and spirited discussion about the pros and cons of the teams playing.\n\nI had their seasonal which was a 4 Peaks Pumpkin porter. My friend had the Kilt Lifter. The glasses came in nice and frozen mugs every time.  The bartender Chelsea was very friendly,  fun,  and johnny on the spot with refills. She did a spectacular job! It was a full bar and most of the table areas were full. She was constantly working and made it fun to ve there.  As did the rest of the staff.\n\nI had the Hot Texas Burger and fries which was fantastic. Very well done and just tasty. I love jalape\u00f1os and bacon  a burger. My friend had the bacon cheese burger. Which he said was delicious. \n\nThe mens restroom was very clean and nice. Which is always a pleasant surprise whenever I am at a sports bar/restaurant. \n\nEven though it was a heck of a drive it wad well worth the trip. Drinks and were a bit more then I normally pay for,  but the quality of the drinks, food, and staff were second to none. Also there is free wifi as well."
0,"DO NOT go to them for eyelash extensions. I have gone here for a pedicure, and they are wonderful at that, I have no complaints on that end, but the extensions are absolutely terrible. I went in two days ago to get my extensions done, my technician was Tiffany, who is also the owner and the only one at the store who does the service for extensions. She used tape to tape down my bottom lashes and to tape around my eye lid for the extension process. As she started applying the extensions to my eyes she was continuously trying to open my eye because the glue was causing my eyes to be glued shut, not only was this extremely painful but it in turn made my eyes water like crazy. After an hour she finally finished and had me hold a little electric fan to my face to dry the glue, I had to rip open my eyes myself because it would hurt so bad when she would do it. After TWO DAYS of having the lashes on I woke up with half the extensions missing on one side. I went back wanting to just get rid of them because of the poor quality of installation, but Tiffany assured me that she could redo them better this time. Same process with the same exact outcome. The lashes are irritating and this time, as I sat there and ripped open my eyes again she gave me a mirror to look at the outcome, I AM NOW MISSING MY BOTTOM EYELASHES FROM HER POOR TECHNIQUE AND SERVICE. As I sat there in her chair and stared at them almost in tears, she told me that it wasn't her fault because she was only doing the top lashes and that my bottom lashes have always been that way because I'm missing them on both sides, which is untrue because I've had long bottom lashes for as long as I can remember. I was so upset that I just left. I didn't want anything else to do with this woman or her salon. I'm so upset with the outcome, and after giving her a chance to fix it I left in even more pain and truly unhappy. She wouldn't take responsibility for anything she did and said that the reason my eyelashes came off in the first place was because my eyes were watering when she installed them, causing them to be too loose and prone to falling out. I'm now in the process of removing them myself because I don't trust them to remove them without destroying my top lashes."
4,"This place is awesome! They take very good care of me every time I go in to service my Rolex or any other watch. When I get my watch cleaned there it comes back looking better then when I bought it! Great service and knowledge of jewelry, with such great prices you can't afford not to go to Gemtime. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone needing a trust worthy place."
2,"Imperial Palace is certainly a deal when it comes to price and location on the strip. Its a good hotel for the price. There are some things that I should point out. When I went in early 2008 they were renovating so things may have changed now but...\n\nThe hallways smelled like smoke, there were bugs in my room window and the concierge did not take our bags to the room. This meant my 65 year old mom was stuck taking bags and luggage up to the room and was dog tired by the time we got up to the room. That part sucked as did paying for Wifi, but the rest was a great experience. If you say that you or a guest has a chronic illness you get a free refrigerator to house medicine. The dealertainers are FREAKING EXCELLENT! These are dealers that dress up like celebrities and then get up and perform every hour or so. \n\nThis place is no Ceasars Palace for sure, but having stayed at an expensive hotel in Vegas (Planet Hollywood) I can tell you that the only difference is how much was spent on the decor which means nothing when you are only in the room to sleep. They're buffet and breakfast is pretty decent too. I'd go elsewhere for clubbing (Mandalay Bay/Planet Hollywood/Palms, but for a cheap place with a nice location not sure this place can be beat.\n\nEdit: What is wrong with people??? I read these reviews and its as if they expect all the great amenities of a $250 a night hotel. If you want hardwood floors, initialed towels and tuxedo'd room service then pay more and shut it. IP is great for the price."
1,We booked through Travelocity and booked out a compact.  They are saying it is a compact CARGO van. They make you pay per mile that you drive but they don't disclose that until you get here. They need to fix something with their system and with Travelocity. At least the manager hooked us up with a mini van that had seats in it for the same price!  Ha. I had to give them another star for that!
4,"Free entry with AMEX Platinum or Centurion card.  To get the AMEX Platinum free for the first year, even if you're not an Ameriprise customer. there's currently http://bit.ly/1qCUddA\n- Or, pay $50 on your AMEX card for entry.  McCarran Terminal 3 also has a \""LAS\"" lounge for $35/entry, haven't been there so can't say how it compares.  If you already have a Priority Pass (which AMEX Platinum & Centurion also includes), then LAS lounge entry is comp'ed. \nI was at Centurion about 5:30 am on Sat/15 Nov:\n- Really swank with the artwork and mod furnishings.\n- Food seemed fine, I didn't really partake except for the fruit.  Place opens at 5 am with continental breakfast but then hot breakfast starts at 6 am.\n- Wi-fi is about 40 download, 20 upload, so twice as fast as my Vegas Chinatown house (Comcast only gets me about 20 download speeds).\n- Lady/server/busperson/bartender made me a mimosa and a vodka seltzer, so kudos to the bar service. (Yes, I drink at 6 am in the morning.  Coffee isn't my thing and I can't turn down free premium booze).\n- They also have a shower + towels, for anyone inclined."
1,"It was ok, took us longer to get there than to walk around the whole museum. Pro was that it only cost us $2/pp with student IDs to go inside so it wasn't a waste of money or anything. The place is pretty empty for the most part, and really small, so hopefully the main location in phoenix is better than this. It was located in a strip mall which was a little awkward, but it gave us something to do over the weekend instead of sitting inside all day. The current exhibit we saw was about native americans and california dreams. There's a sculpture garden outside, which has about 3 sculptures. I think if you happen to be going to Safeway and see it, it's worth stopping by. But I wouldn't say it's a must see if you happen to be in Scottsdale, because it is waaay north and I already live in north scottsdale right now"
0,"I'm a little bummed out about Venezias...A couple of time my bf has called to inquire about slices of pesto pizza in the evenings, and each time the people at venezias mentioned that they only have pesto slices at lunch. I obviously can't eat a whole pizza, so I decided to wait until i wanted pizza for lunch to go ahead and order.   so today the bf called at lunchtime to inquire about pesto slices, and lo and behold they had them.  so he drives to tempe  to pick up a couple of slices of pesto pizza.  He gets home, opens the box, and the slices have chicken on them, which nobody mentioned to him at venezias.  I'm a vegetarian so these slices of pizza are now useless. he calls to mention this to the folks at venezias, and they say the never serve slices of pesto without chicken on them.  I'm left wondering why NOBODY mentioned this in the 3 phone calls over the last month in which we inquired about slices of pesto pizza.  beyond that, they don't offer to replace these slices for free, or anything. pizza in the garbage.   bummer, big waste of time and effort."
3,"So when I lived in Vegas, my dad owned a shop just steps away from this place and I NEVER EVEN KNEW IT WAS THERE! Thanks to Yelp, we decided to try it this past weekend. \n\nIt's off the strip, and the first thing you notice is the building itself. The spot used to be a Wienerschnitzel, so it's a triangular shaped building, panted in black. So we get there and park, it's a Sunday afternoon and the place is slammed! We ordered the #2 Cheez Whiz, and we also got sweet potato fries, fried okra and chicken wings. The steak sandwich was amazing! Next time we go back, we're just getting more of those! The friend okra was good, nothing memorable, same goes for the wings. I'd never had sweet potato fries, but now that I have, I know I'm not a fan. I love, however, their consistency, they had a perfect crunch to them, I kept eating them, even though I wasn't crazy about the taste. Odd huh?\n\nAgain, the place was super busy, and there were only two guys running the spot. They were doing a fantastic job, and very very friendly! I'd highly recommend you venture off the strip the next time you're in Vegas and give this gem a shot! Stick to the Philly Steaks!"
0,Worst experience of the day looking at cars wanted to run my credit to test drive a car and I was paying cash what a bunch if crap and the salesman kept trying to have come aback another day to look at cars that were sitting in the lot but he didn't want to go get the keys don't go here to even look at a car.
3,"I have never had East African or Ethiopian cuisine before. I was hesitant to try Buraka at first, but I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe Samoosas and the fried plantain appetizers were delicious. Most of the main entrees at Buraka are curry dishes. I tried the Dorowot and the Siga Alicha and both were pretty tasty. The good thing is that for adventurous patrons, there's an option to try a combination of two dishes and do a half-and-half. I highly recommend that.\n\nThe service at Buraka is great, so ask for recommendations. You won't be disappointed in their food."
0,"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. We each got 3 tacos each & the Fish/meat were ice cold on all of them. The tortillas were also cold & probably came straight from the bag to our plates. Really BAD!!! I will not be back!!!!!"
2,"Have been wanting to try this place for while, I have heard such good things. Some friends thought it sounded good as well so we all decided to give it a go.\nWe sat out on the patio since the weather was so nice for a spring evening.\nOur waiter was pleasant and was happy to answer questions. My husband and I didn't want to fill up or have leftovers since we were going out of town in a few days. So we decided to split the Due Forni Neapolitan style. It was good, just nothing special. The price was high for such a small pizza. I think I'll stick with my current favorite Grimaldi's.\nWe split the Bacon topped Chocolate Gelato for dessert. It was good but felt like it needed something...we decided either caramel sauce or pretzel crumbles would've done the trick.\nSince the restaurant wasn't too busy we hung out and talked at our table for a while after we ate. The waiter was awesome and continued to make sure our water glasses were full."
0,Waste of time and money. Paid around $11 for lunch as I just missed the happy hour. Just fatty pieces of pork. I will never come here again. Seems like they were more interested in the tour bus business. They even asked if I wanted to come back at another time.
0,W. T. Freakazoid.  For the price it is not with it.  Service was fast and friendly but the food was lacking flavor and the selection wasn't all that great for a buffet.  The money they ask for would be better spent at one of the regular restaurants (or just spent on drinks at a bar) with a good entree and drink.
2,"We came here after an Angels spring training game. The yellow banner hanging in right field at tempe stadium that read \""Dos gringos: A good place for day drinking\"" was convincing enough. Good happy hour, good margarita, decent food, ok atmosphere, alright service.. Probably not a place I would visit again."
1,"Overall service was not good including no shows, late returns and \""redo\"" cleaning.\n\nServices were carpet cleaning and duct cleaning:\n\nRick had a total can do attitude and worked hard to please which gained him an extra star.  \n\n*  Summary:\n1.) They did not show up on day requested and I wasted an entire Saturday waiting until  4PM.  Showed up late on the other 2 days they came.\n2.) Rescheduled the next day but they could only do the half the job,carpets, and not the ducts.\n3.) Carpets were not in great condition so it was redone when the ducts were done Tuesday\n4.) 5 days between when I moved my furniture and was able to move it back in - Saturday furniture out - Wednesday furniture in.  Slept on a couch.....\n\n*  Details:\nMoved furniture out on Saturday and job was not complete until Tuesday at 9:30PM so furniture was not back in until the next day:\n1.) Called Friday from work and booked for Saturday, great job on availability\n2.) Saturday came and I moved all of my furniture out for floors to be cleaned.  Arrival quote was a 2 hour window.  Time window came and went without a call.  Apparently there was an attempt to contact me the day of appointment to confirm but they called my work number and of course I was not there.  They went on to the next job. I accept some responsibility because maybe I should have ensured they had my home number. Rescheduled for Sunday and gave them my cell number.\n3.) On Sunday they were late and I called.  They were running behind, which is ok but there was no call.  They arrived and said they could only do the carpet cleaning but I had to wait on the ducts.  Once again, sure no problem.  After 6 hours the carpets were dry but crunchy.  I vacuumed a 12' x 16' area and pulled up a lot of dirt and hair, I am linking a photo.  I was told there would be a lot of hair because I have a dog and cat, but there was a lot of dirt as well.  Rick said he would do it over no problem but not until Tuesday when we do the ducts.  Keep in mind I am sleeping on a couch since Saturday because all the furniture was moved..\n4.) Tuesday comes and they were late again, about an hour.  Suppose to be here at 6:30 but arrived at 7:30.  They did the ducts, but I have 2 AC units.  They turned on 1 unit and did the whole house.  I heard Rick telling his employee that it is useless to do the ducts without having the unit fan on.  Then I said I have 2 units and only 1 was on and he said it is ok they got it all....  They were obviously rushing close to the end because they were not done until after 9:30.\n\n* Also there was one duct that was hanging off in a room where all the furniture was piled.  I said no problem I could do it.  Screws were stripped and I had to buy new screws.\n\nSorry for dissertation but would I use their service again, no.  I understand what it is to be busy but at some point you have to say no to more jobs.  \n\nThanks."
3,"Great little find!  I have driven by this place a gazillion times and finally stopped in yesterday for a late breakfast.  I had the skinny scramble. Egg whites, feta, spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes over a smaller size portion of the country potatoes.  YUMMY!  Huge menu with lots of choices.....I will definitely go back to sample other menu items!!"
4,"The people here are ALL very friendly and fast/efficient at their specialties. From Doctors, to assistants, to Xray people, to office workers, they all seem to work seemlessly as a team.  Phones are answered quickly and they know how to help. I've been there three times so far and each visit went well. When they say it's going to be painless-it really is, at least in my case. I wish I hadn't put it off for so long! Oh, and the credit plan helped make it possible financially with small payments & ZERO interest! Wow! Thank you Western Dental 75th & McDowell."
3,"Hed been putting off this day for years now . . . with a name like \""Smash Burger\"" I was expecting a thin dried out burger . . . boy was I wrong.\n\nHad the mushroom and swiss smash burger and it was hot, juicy and oozing with flavor . . . a 6 napkin burger . . . the only thing better would be if I could make it a double . . . them I would be in hamburger heaven.\n\nNow you may ask . . . if it was so great . . . why only four stars.  Well, the friers were being serviced so no \""Smash Fries\"" that I had heard about.  But if the burger alone get this place four stars . . . I would be willing to bett the fries would push it up to five stars.\n\nI return trip is definitely in the near future . . ."
0,"Got some cute glasses here and would have rated them 4 stars for that but just called them to get some information about my prescription and learned that they subscribe to the old \""hold the prescription hostage to ensure that the customer can only return to you for the next pair of glasses.\""  Got the \""hard sell.\""'  He would be glad to get me my glasses but not willing to give me information from my prescription.  Really, cute glasses are everywhere.  Find your next pair at an optician who doesn't play this kind of game."
0,"Will never return. Ridiculous prices and crappy work. Had boots resoled and tips put on another pair of heels. As they handed me the shoes, the tip fell off in his hand!! So he puts it back on, I wear them the next day and the tip is missing after one hour of wear. Not sure about the boots, too scared to wear them incase the whole sole falls off!!! You suck Moses! Would try to fix shoes myself before ever returning to your shop!! I don't trust them to even attempt to fix them, will go elsewhere and pay again! By the way, the price of this shoddy work?? $65! Beware! Go anywhere else!"
3,Had a huge lemom cupcake with cream cheese frosting. Nice strong lemon flavor to the cake and the frosting was creamy and delicious. The shop is conveniently located in a mall and reasonably price.
2,"Not a bad idea. At Alexander's Steakhouse, you pick your own steak and cook it at the community grill. \n\nFor starters, the steak's quality here is just okay. It's not the greatest, but I've had worse. And for okay steak, I feel they are overpriced in general and not just for college students. \n\nTheir steak challenge is pretty interesting though. If you can finish a 3 lb (48 oz) along with the side dishes and salad that comes with this challenge, you win a free meal. The rewards of this challenge has changed from time to time (i.e. the steak is free, you get a free steak next time, or you get 50% off next time, etc). I've tried this before. It was pretty fun and I got my picture taken and placed on their wall. \n\nOverall, Alexander's is a good break from the national chain steak restaurants. You'll pay a little more than you want for some decent steak. Oh and as a warning, if you can't grill a steak, then you'll have to pay an additional fee to have the chef cook it."
2,"Very small bar, but they did offer a Greek beer or two which was nice.\n\nFlaming cheese and assortment of appetizers was fairly good (hummus, baba, etc.) but pricey.  Falafel was among the worst I've had in the valley - larger balls, but very dry and too dense inside.  Not many other options for those of us who normally stick to falafel."
0,Disappointing to say the least....\nThis is my 4th time here and I wouldn;t have gone here so many times if it wasn't the proximity to MCC. Each and everytime I have been rather dissapointed with teh level of service which has been slow and blase at the best of times.\n This time around I had to wait 20 miniutes at teh sushi bar (after my order) before teh chef showed up. By then I had lost interest in suchi and Saketini as a whole. I would understand if this place was crowded but there were only 2 other groups and that too none of them were at the bar.\n\nNote to self: Never venture here again
3,"Yeah, this is a sad one.  Primitive used to be an important part of my constellation of Montreal record stores, but now, having downsized drastically, I'm not sure how much longer that'll be the case.  They've always been strong when it comes to sixties pop and rock, both Anglo and Franco, and I've found many, many amazing finds in their \""new arrivals\"" bins over the years.  Tasteful selection of vinyl reissues."
3,"This location was previously a Robertos.  It is a similar in style to Robertos - quick serve mexican restaurant.  I go here not expecting culinary greatness - more for a quick flavorful lunch.  It's cheap and they almost always have a lunch special.  The Chile Relleno burrito is my favorite.  Ask for 2 rellenos and less of the other stuff.  \n\nSome times they have chicken tacos for .99... Bueno!\n\nBasically - nothing fancy, but it's fast, tasty and cheap."
3,"Great breakfast spot, pancakes were delicious, service was great."
1,"I like hot dogs. They're simple and come with their own edible carrying cases. Not totally self-contained like a corndog, but close!\n\nWhile waiting for a plane, I found Frankly Gourmet, a place selling only tubular goodness. Their promotional posters proclaim that they feature the best Oscar Meyer-branded meats. They do indeed have many choices on the menu, from the regular hot dog to the mighty jumbo hot dog, and various types of kielbasi.\n\nAfter some deliberation, I went for a jumbo hot dog. Of their numerous fixings, I asked for onions, jalapenos and relish. Sadly, the hot dog itself was blah-tasting, didn't really distinguish itself, and the bread bun tasted like cardboard*, which was disappointing, and kind of scary, really. Your mileage may vary, of course, so try this at your own risk.\n\n* no Chinese pork bun jokes, please"
3,"Great restaurant, excellent atmosphere. Heavy on the pork. Just a touch pricey."
3,"I try not to write too much about chains, but we came here for happy hour, we we went too familiar with their menu and we kinda screwed up our order and got way too much food, It was kind of a breakdown between customer and server, but we had to bite the bullet on some of it and still pay for more than we ordered, but they also helped out by knocking off a couple bucks and then giving us free apps the next time were in."
4,"It's been a long time since I came to Carlos and Pepe's and boy has it changed. I went upstairs to the bar for a quick bite before the Habs game and was shocked how beautiful the place was. The waiter told me they had just renovated and installed a new menu. I had the grilled chicken quesadillas and they were fantastic. Lots of beer choices now as well. wish I had more time, but will definitely be back."
4,"Delicious, clean, modern, eclectic, artsy.  \n\nThe Cob salad is now the best cob salad in town.  I thought Peppermill was the best, but it just got beat out!  The iced tea is also the best iced tea in Las Vegas, super refreshing, maxed out flavor.\n\nI have one suggestion about the Turkey burgers: make them bigger.  While they taste great, full of flavor, they are just too small.  I'd need three of them to fill me up.  And offer some cheese please.\n\nFYI: Parking at this location is difficult and you will most likely walk.  Also the location off of Las Vegas Blvd and the Odgen is extremely difficult to find parking."
1,"Ok place to hang out for a quick drink but if you actually want to get comped drinks for playing video blackjack/poker, forget it after one. We played for quite a while but even with putting more $20's into the machine (I was losing, boo!), the waitresses seemed to make a point of ignoring us. So no, not really a favorite place to hang in Vegas."
3,"My boyfriend and I came here this past Friday night for dinner as we had both drive by the place quite often and have been wanting to try it out. \n\nThe service was great and I liked the wide open space. We tried two different beer samples for a $1 each and settled on splitting a pitcher of Levitation which we both enjoyed.\n\nWe ordered the green chile dip appetizer. I ordered the shrimp tacos and my boyfriend ordered the brisket. He LOVED the brisket and after taking a bite of it, I could see why. It was quite good. My shrimp tacos however, were so bland that I barely ate half of my meal. And it was a \""small plate.\"" I wasn't the biggest fan of our appetizer but after tasting my dinner, I decided I liked the dip a lot more and finished it off. Definitely do not recommend the shrimp tacos.\n\nOne annoying thing was our meals came out right after our appetizer. A little time in between would have been good - but I'll take that over slow service any day. \n\nI'm giving this place four stars because of how great the brisket was and despite not liking my dish, I had a great time and think this place has lots of potential. I'll be back to try something else!"
1,"Ever see or hear of the movie '50/50'? Well, I would've loved to have seen that movie at the AMC Esplanade 14 Fork & Screen \""experience\"" because that was the \""experience\"" I had there: 50% good and 50% terrible.\n\nIt all started good - that's the 50%. The waiter Scotty was awesome upfront, the price of the ticket affordable and the food was very good - I had the classic Chicken quesadilla, Parmesan fries and a \""supposedly\"" free-refillable Cherry Coke. The screen and sound were good and so was the idea of having someone come when you needed them by a press of a service button. I'll tell you the truth: I rarely go to the movies these days and it's mostly because of the inconsiderate jerks who use their cell phones, held up as high and bright as possible, to text. Granted, I was literally the only other one in the theatre this time, but I was very prepared to press the button and get anyone kicked out who attempted to ruin yet another good time with their selfish texting.\n\nOk...and here's the 50% bad part: the plastic/barely rocking chairs were uncomfortable after awhile. I ran out of my soda 30 minutes into the showing and I pressed the button. Scotty had not returned. I thought maybe it was broken, so after 10 minutes, I turned it off and on again. Still no Scotty. Finally 30 minutes later he came back with the bill and sternly told me to turn off the button as if it was bothering him the whole time. Uh...#1 it wouldn't be bothering you if you came within, say those first 10 minutes and #2 isn't this the perk of being at this theatre?\n\nIn addition, he didn't give me a pen to sign the receipt. I wasn't about to use the useless button again, so I just left the merchant copy. Only, I thought it appropriate to tip my waiter and I was going to add it using my card on the little \""tip line.\"" Finally, I just put a few dollars I had on me in with the bill. Obviously, he didn't come back to get the receipt, so when I left the theatre when the movie was over, I looked for him. He was gone, wherever. In this economy and for someone working for AMC, you'd think he'd want a couple extra bucks for his efforts. (I say the \""working for AMC\"" part, because I have worked for the company and I know all about minimum wages and abuse from management.)\n\nSo, I took back the tip money, handed the receipt to the bartender and left disappointed. Heck, they didn't even let me keep the plastic Coke cup nor did they honor the menu they publish online: I really wanted the Sicilian Pizzinis but they didn't have it on their hard-copy menu and Scotty know nothing of a \""Pizzinis.\""\n \nSince the \""service\"" button is irrelevant and since I can just as easily eat popcorn or eat at a restaurant before/after, I doubt I'll be driving half-way across the city to come back here any time soon."
4,"This is my favorite espresso cafe in the Fitchburg area.  High quality coffee, very nice chill atmosphere, and best of all, close to work.  Plus, they are locally owned and the owners are there regularly working, as well as supporting local artists.  Happy to support shops like this."
2,"I use to go there every weekend for dimsum.\nI didn't mind waiting 30 min to get in, the food was good.\n\nBUT...one day I saw food from the cart dropped on the floor, and the manager came quick and put that food back in the plate and served....\nI could not believe my eyes.\n\nThat was the last day for me and C-Fu restaurant."
2,"Meal:  Good portion and pretty good lunch combo deal. Love the chips and dips they provided.  The churros were really good.\n\nService:  The food was really good but the service was ridiculously slow.  We came here for my coworker's birthday so we have a large party of 11.  I understand that with a large party food sometimes take longer to come out.  However, it is not a reason to make the lunch a 3 hour event.  We looked around and saw that they were a bit understaff so we were a bit patient with waiting.  I was the only one in the group that ordered a margarita because a lot of people said they were great here.  But they managed to forget my drink, it was even harder to wave someone down to remind them.  Alas, I never got it. I'm just going to assume that it was never in the system.  With all the waiting and how long the meal was, one of my other coworker just got up and flagged down the waiter to get our check and paid the bill so we didn't have to wait for split checks. I don't even want to imagine how long that would've taken.\n\nConclusion: I would tell people to try this place but please only do it when you know you do not need to be somewhere after the meal just because you never know when you can leave."
3,This place has more employees than the population of most towns in the state of Nevada.  Expect huge.   MGM Grand is ever-changing.  From the restaurant choices to their soap wrappers.  And the lion exhibit is my favorite free thing to do in Vegas.
4,Chicken arugula salad. 'Nuff said.
2,"I wasn't impressed with their burgers, they were ok but nothing special! However, the service and atmosphere were good for families with children"
0,"A waste of money....they sneak around repairs by gluing and temporarily fixing things that aren't really repaired then charge you an arm and a leg and give you a two week wait....down the street there's mom and pop shops that can get the job done in three days,properly done,and don't rob you....these people got a good rep and now the multitude of customers must have made them forget we are the reason they stay busy....not the fools they think of us...."
4,"Loved this little place. A true local gem, with great brews and good food!"
4,"Tapas. We ordered the first seven appetizers on the menu and they were all perfect. How is that possible? All 7 appetizers perfectly done. We were not in a Michelin star restaurant in New York or LA. This was Champaign, Illinois- a university town. I did not expect such impeccably crafted food and such top notch service but then again I found it here. Food this good merits 5 stars. Deeply satisfying and perfect for a quiet date or even a night out with friends. \n\nAgain, I only tried the tapas. I see no reason why the rest of the menu won't impress."
0,"Horrible experience from the moment I walked in. The restaurant was slow yet the waitress took forever to take our order and lacked quality service. When the food came to the table my plate was dirty, full of debris and appeared very unappetizing. When we asked to bring the concerns to the managers attention the manager simply felt that replateing my food into another plate would solve the issue. When I did eat the food it was warm not hot and felt as though it had been microwaved. Lastly, the icing on the cake is the fact that I was charged $0.99 for table top entertainment without notice or consent. This was my second time there and will be my last. Do not go eat here, stay far away and cook at home because it will be 100x better."
2,"Very convenient when staying at the Signature, especially when you do not want to take the journey to any of the eateries the hotel has to offer. Fairly priced for Vegas standards and the overall quality was there. Stopped for a brunch and felt satisfied with the veggie omelet, white chocolate French toast and tuna melt sandwich."
0,"Maybe it's me.  Maybe it was just bad luck.  But I've gotta say, our last (and unfortunately it will probably be exactly that) visit to PF Chang's was just horrible.  Service was slow as always, mainly because the place is typically packed with people.  No problem.  We weren't in a hurry and patiently waited the 30 minutes necessary to get a table.  Our server was attentive and had a fun attitude, so no problem there either.  \n\nIt was the food that was just unacceptable.  Overpriced for sure, but poorly prepared too.  Orange Peel Chicken was soggy and tasted like it was a three-day old left-over pulled from fridge and reheated in a microwave (really).  My son ordered the salmon and we had to send it back not once, but twice due to being undercooked.  The center was literally raw both times.  The last straw was when one of the junior \""managers\"" came to the table to say that, \""We cook the salmon that way on purpose.\""  Really?  As if it was sushi?  Wow.  \n\nSorry guys, you are just not worth it."
2,"Craving for some more authentic Vietnamese pho. Yelped and found this place in Pittsburgh. Drive 80 miles from Morgantown, WV and found the pho is good. when I first walked in, I was a little bit skepical because everyone else was white! Lesson I learned before was that this could be a sign that this restaurant would be tailoring to american taste. But since I drove 80 miles already I decided to give it a try. the menu was pretty small comparing to mecca of Asian food (Southern California). Ordered the Pho dac bet. When the pho came out, i thought it would be like the Southern California size as the bowl was decent size. But the pho and soup were sitting at the bottom of the bowl, about 1/3 full. I was a bit disappointed. I loaded up my bean sprouts into the hot soup and did a quick stir to cook the raw thinly slice steak. The pho was actually pretty decent. The soup was flavorful and the pho was well cooked. Just wish the amount of pho and the ingredients could be more. I ended up having a roast beef sandwich at Nadine's afterward."
3,"have sandwiches been around for 250 years? \n\nsandwiches here are good considering the price. they are pretty fast, but if you arent there when they call your number, they will not call it again. the cupcakes are not worth eating. the ice cream sandwiches were out. i wish i could have tried them."
1,"The seafood prepared here was the least fresh I have had in Phoenix. I've had better results with the Sushi at Safeway or Trader Joes. The beer and wine menu also needs something to separate itself from every other restaurant. If you're looking for Sushi on the far West side, the only joint left after the demise of Be Sushi is Koi (across from the Arrowhead Harkins)."
1,"I visited this restaurant because I got a groupon now deal. When I walked In and the older woman standing there took about 5 minutes to acknowledge that I was standing there at the counter waiting to be served..\n\nFinally she said \""whenever your ready..\"". I told her hi how are you, giving her a nice reminder that that is how your supposed to greet new customers in your establishment. That on its own turned me off because I hate giving my money away tobusinesses that don't appreciate me.  I don't feel like I am asking for much in exchange for coming back and supporting local businesses. \n\nAs I was standing waiting for my food I overheard the employees (including my o so pleasnt serve lady) complaining about the groupons that kept coming in.. while I was standing there! Rude! \n\nThe older man behind the counter making sandwiches was very nice. He is the only reason I am giving two stars. \n\nThe food on the other hand was decent. Too bad I won't ever becoming back just to be treated like I am bothering them.. next time I will just eat mcdonalds breakfast like I wanted anyways."
4,"My husband and I celebrated our 17th anniversary here! We loved the atmosphere and the service is awesome! We are raving fans of Citizens Public House so knowing that they own Gladly, it was a must try! If you work in the area, check out the Happy Hour! Fun place to hang out and great bites not to mention very cool cocktails! The only thing I like better at Citizens is that is not as quite and my favorite bartender isn't there! Lol! Definite got to go!"
0,"This course has gone down hill drastically.  They are under new management but the course is not maintained at all, or at least very little.  If your looking to get out and just practice then it is fine.  The fairways are turning to dirt and the greens are really bad.  I play there because it is close but as in another review, you get what you pay for.  The prices for the course are too high.  I don't know what happened from last year but I am looking to golf somewhere else."
1,"Oh the sorrow... \n\nWhat can I say, I was expecting more. I had gone to another Benihana's in New Jersey, but we only went to the Teppanyaki part of it. I signed up online to get alerts for specials and such, so I got a $30 certificate for my birthday. \n\nWent here Friday, with the hubster, because I called to see when their all you can eat sushi was. Luckily its everyday! Couldn't wait to have our massage and sushi date night! \n\nNow, we've been to Japan, have had awesome sushi, love 202 Crazy Fish Sushi in Tempe and decided to try Benihana's...big mistake.\nI should've learned after we had gone to Kabuki, knowing that it's a chain and that the sushi is, well, bad. The variety was good, the fish wasn't its freshest fish and who puts mayo on their sushi? Why does this happen at chains? The sushi chef was Japanese, as was our waitress, so we talked to her a bit abt our visit to Japan, my sister in law, etc. But the sushi was warm, fell apart and the fish, bland...I'll just stickl w/ Crazy Fish, who does his sushi with love and knows what my husband and I like."
3,"We stumbled upon this place as a result of a Groupon deal they had a few months ago, and boy, I'm glad we did! \n\nThe ambiance is fantastic, very \""Las Vegas\"" and dramatic. The menu is extensive and everything we ordered was fantastic. The waiter was very attentive and gave us 5 star service. \n\nThe only downfall is the price - but, you're in Vegas so it's worth it, right?"
0,"Most of the meal was ok, however the main entree was very disappointing, I only took two bites.  Told the server who took my food and didn't ask if I would like anything else.  When the bill came, the food was still on there so I asked to speak to the manager.  The manager came out eating my order telling me how wonderful it was and that I would have to pay for it.I said \""fine\"", and he screamed that he was going to call the police if I didn't pay.  I paid the bill, and as we were leaving he stopped us & asked me what was wrong with the food.  I barely began explaining when he cut me off insinuating I didn't know good cuisine.  My girlfriend started to speak about my former experience working in fine dining and he tore into her, and seemed like he was about to get violent and said he was going to report us for trespassing.    I have never been treated this poorly at any establishment and we were very traumatized and confused about the whole situation."
2,"Very nice products, beautifully made, however sales girl did not know very much about the leathers and owner was not in shop, we bought an item, then when it didnt work, and we did an exchange, owner was there and charged extra for same item that was originally less than whag we bought,.a bit disappointed."
1,"Really overrated.  The owner told me his lamb was the best.  I don't think so! Lamb shank was mediocre with a dull and thin flavored brown sauce. The pork had little flavor.  The bread is weak too. What's best is the way they source their food. Grass-fed, organic etc. All in all its no big deal. They can do a lot better and so can you!!"
0,"If I could submit a negative star review, I would.\n\nMy short review: AWFUL. SCAM. RUN FAR AWAY.\n\nI ordered three shirts from Frank & Oak in early November 2013. I congratulated myself because they were stylish shirts and great value $20/shirt. They were going to be Christmas gifts for my Dad and my two brothers. \n\nF&O had no issues charging my credit card. What  they had issues on was delivering the products I paid for. I waited until two weeks before Christmas; that's 6 weeks of waiting and still nothing. \n\nI contacted them via their 1-855 number. No one picked up after the myriad of buttons I had to push. I ended up getting voicemail which I couldn't leave one because the mailbox was full.\n\nI sent them an email. No response. I went on their Facebook page and left a comment about my experience and my order. Was I surprised that their FB page was full of complaints exactly the same as mine? At this point, misery loves company. \n\nF&O screwed up HUGE! Right before the holidays. A-holes.\n\nI finally got a response AFTER Christmas saying they were sending me one of the shirts AND they would refund me the rest of my money. I guess I was never getting the shirts. Word of advice F&O, how about giving the customer the options to receive the merchandise or receive the refund.\n\nFinally, I never got the refund. So I was out money and had no product.\n\nFrank & Oak is like that hot guy/gal you meet at the bar/club/online. Seemingly very attractive, makes lots of promises, and leaves you with less money and a bad taste in your mouth."
2,"P.J. Clarke's opened tonight in the Forum Shops at Caesar's.  Our regular Friday Night gang met there last night for the last of their \""soft openings.\""  In the interest of full disclosure, our dinner was comped, and was mostly limited to the evening's featured \""softie\"" - burgers.  I say mostly, because when we got there, late, victims of the traffic that engulfed the Strip due to the influx of CES tourists, our friends were already gorging on a plate of raw oysters, and that wasn't on the list we were given.   We, too, were coming from the Convention center, and it took us 45 minutes to get to Caesar's, then another 10 to get the car valet'd, since that, too, was full.\n\nHubster and I don't eat oysters, so our friends managed to convince them to bring us shrimp.  And gawd, those were the biggest damned shrimp I've ever seen.  They were terrific.\n\nThe real freebie consisted of wine or beer, burgers, fries, and salad.  We're white wine drinkers, and there was no Riesling, just Chardonnay and Pino Grigio.  The Pino was super dry, so I had some Merlot.  The salad was one big disappointment, just a pile of ugly greens with a few thin slices of the tiniest baby radish I ever could imagine.  Your eight bucks won't get you anything else, not even a crouton.\n\nThe burgers were great - fresh, meaty, not oversalted - but the buns were just ordinary.  I ordered mine with Vermont cheddar, sauteed onions, and mushrooms.  Toppings are $1.20 each, so that brought the burger close to $14, which I guess is par for the Strip, which is why we stick mostly local.  I also ordered a cup of coffee, and it was cold.\n\nWhat really drowned this place for us, though, was the water, pun intended.  The waiter asked whether we all wanted water.  I said \""no,\"" but got it anyway.  It was served in small glasses slightly larger than juice glasses, with no logo.  There was no brand to approve, no cork to sniff, no swirling nor sniffing.  Yet when we got the pretend bill, we noticed that THEY CHARGED FOR THE WATER!!!  What the hell are they thinking???  Has Lake Mead become a designer label??  And that, dear reader, is my death knell for this restaurant.\n\nThe service was spotty.  The place wasn't more than one-third full, yet our waiter had some trouble keeping up and getting things right.  Service picked up tremendously when Marty, who said he was a busser, joined the team.  A young and earnest full-time Type A, he went over and above to see that we were satisfied.  He was definitely worth the price of admission.\n\nP.J. Clarke's is a venerable New York institution, in business since 1884, and that's no typo.  They're suddenly pushing to go national - they have a branch in Chicago, one that just opened in D.C., and now, Vegas.  I tried to check the website to see what the full menu is like, but the links on the Vegas page aren't working, at least on Firefox and Chrome.  (I don't go near IE).  IMHO, this is symbolic of the lengths they'll need to travel to distinguish themselves from all the competition in this town.  And if they persist in charging for tap water, it's going to be a long road to travel."
4,Very authentic Mexican food. Sorry I can't say what I ate but it was great. The only thing they didn't have was con queso white cheese dip but they did have a great bean dip. Service was fantastic too.
3,"Tessaro's, I kept hearing, was the best burger joint in the burgh. The award, in my opinion, is still up in the air. I have quite a few more places to check out!\n\nA huge plus to Tessaro's for their kitchen! Wow is that thing small. And the two guys working were rolling the burger patties right through the window. AHHH MAZING! I also heard Tessaro's butchers their own meat on site. I love hearing this. \n\nTessaro's is definitely worth checking out. The lunch crowd gets a bit tight as their tables are close. Perhaps try a bit before or after the average lunch hour. Oh, and they aren't open on Sundays so steer clear of that day."
0,"Food was terrible for the price.  I ordered the MahiMahi taco's and my husband ordered the Jumbo Sea Scallops.  The fish tacos, had hardly any fish and the fish that was on it,  tasted very old and fishy, ( freezerburn) ( it was not fresh fish)YUCK!. The jumbo Sea Scallops were rubbery and not very jumbo. That order took almost 40 minutes to get and it wasn't very busy.  They charged us an additional $2.50 to split a wedge salad that already cost $9.95. We sent back our food and ordered a hamburger and split that and they charged us an additional $ 2. 50 to cut a hamburger in half, and the waitress stated I could have a side with the hamburger, I ordered a side salad ( We don't eat carbs, so I didn't order the fries) it was an additional $ 2.00 upcharge. At no point in time did the waitress ever tell us about any of the split plate fees or upcharges.  So for a split hamburger, a split wedge salad and 2 waters, we paid $29.12. What a rip off!! and we sat there for almost 2 hours."
3,"21st first introduced me to pour over single origin coffees.\n\nMy new favorite way to experience coffee, for sure.\n\nIf you're new to the artisan coffee world, this might not be the best place for you to go -- they can come off as pretentious at times but, they do understand that the \""customer is always right\"" ...you might just have to ask a few times for sugar or creamer for your coffee."
2,"first time trying this place & I had the mushroom melt cheeseburger & skin cleanser juice. I had my order to go.\n\nThe burger was good although i wish there was more mushrooms to keep the burger juicy.\n\nThe skin cleanser juice surprised me in that it tasted exactly like carrot juice unless that's what it's supposed to taste like. I enjoy fresh juice,but when it tastes like veggies, which i'm not a huge veggie eater i don't personally enjoy it.\n\nI'll try this place out again."
3,"Got bagels here for an office meeting a few months ago and was impressed.  Unforunately, it took me about three months to get back to this place.  And again, it was great.  Friendly, warm customer service.  The bagels are not too chewy, and even have a little crunch to them.\n\nThe amount of salt they use in the dough is perfect.  It's slightly salty if you eat it plain, which I love salt so I'm not complaining, but that extra salt really balances when you add cream cheese.\n\nThey have a good selection of bagels, and of cream cheeses as well.\n\nDefinitely going back."
4,"Thank you fellow Yelpers for the GREAT recommendation!! My eleven year old daughter and I went in for a treat today, and a treat is exactly what we got!! Yes, we had to wait about 15 minutes because we didn't have an appointment, but it was WELL worth the wait!  We both had the deluxe pedicure and it was probably the best pedicure I have ever had!  Mai was so meticulous and did a wonderful job of pampering my tired feet and helping me relax!  Even the woman who did my daughters pedi was super sweet and treated her as if she was a regular customer, not a child.  We felt so pampered and loved that our feet tingled for the next few hours after our pedis!  Next time we will definitely make an appointment, and we will absolutely be back!!"
0,Was not impressed. Don't come here if you are trying to watch a game. Came to watch a playoff game and couldnt even see a tv. The Gila monster was disgusting. Didn't even taste like anything. Not worth the $9. Also the pretzel platter was nothing special.
1,"The Church Brew Works is one of those places where everyone has been and everyone raves about...but I just do not get it. I guess part of the reason I don't really dig it is because I'm more of a cocktail gal than a beer fan. Aside from the fact that it is a brewery and I'm not really a beer drinker, the food is only so-so. I got a perogie dish with chicken and my friend got salmon. Her salmon was ok and the same goes for my perogie dish. We shared some homemade chips with a beer/cheese dip before our meal. The chips were really good, but the same as any place that serves homemade chips, and the beer/cheese dip tasted like chicken broth. It lacked anything special. The atmosphere is awesome, and it would be such a cool place for a classic Pittsburgh rehearsal dinner or similar event...but the food is just ... eh. The atmosphere is the only redeeming quality that I can find. \n\nAlso, our waitress was (I can't find a nice way to say this...I'm sorry) kind of annoying. She called us both \""Hun\"" and \""Sweetheart\"" the ENTIRE evening. It felt like those words are a verbal tic of hers...Every other word was Hun or Sweetheart. Her nails had been painted weeks ago...because there was a horrid spot of nearly gone green nail polish on every nail. It only takes a minute to remove nail polish, and when working in an industry that involves putting your hands in front of people it is worth either repainting them, or leaving them clean. The \""I painted my nails a month ago and haven't gotten around to repainting them or removing the polish\"" look is NOT ok. Ok...I'm being mean. I'm sorry...but both my friend and I noticed her nails and her verbal tic, and we were both annoyed by both. \n\nAll in all, it's somewhere that all Pittsburghers have to go at least once to see the awesome building, but don't have high expectations...it's just ok."
0,"If this is ITALIAN, the Olive Garden needs to cater my wedding...BadaBing! Food is supposed to be an art...not a tourist trap.\n\nI have many horror stories to share while dining in Las Vegas primarily because the idea of Vegas being a place to get a great meal for a reasonable price kind of died when the Mafia left and the Donald Trump took over. Ask yourself why these casinos keep losing money. If you ever want to know Old Las Vegas - read Fools Die by Mario Puzo (Godfather author). Or watch Crime Story with Dennis Farina. Wow. To imagine that men used to wear suits and not mesh t-shirts to gamble in. \n\nSo my friends decided to eat here and I was so happy from the 3 martinis that I just downed that I failed to notice...I was about to eat in a restaurant that claimed to be Italian in the middle of Las Vegas. Both Italian and Japanese foods are the kinds of thing that you can make \""look good\"" but the taste is another story.\n\nAnyway, we were greeted by the most interesting waiter I have ever had. \n\nHe was clearly not Italian and yet felt the need to continue to imitate an Italian accent and butcher Italian words. It was like watching the Sopranos with these moron actors who behave like a stereotype of a stereotype of Frankie Five Angels. BadaBing. Eh, woulda you lika some parmigano? (he asks) Woulda you lika to knowa the specials? Woulda you lika to meeta me later for a nighta cap? More pepe, say when...Really. Do tell.\n\nSo Momo boy tries to convince us all to order some beef dish that is supposed to be like osso buco. If that's the selling feature, you might just want to cut to the chase and give us Osso Buco instead. \n\nOk. He goes on and on and on about how f-ing mama mia bellisima straciatella columbia vafancullo this bloody dish is. So as I am kind of drunk and my friend is too nice to say no, we order it... on the condition that if we don't like it - BadaBing - Donatello will get us another plate of anything we want and EAT the Bella Bella dish ...HIMSELF!!! This was the offer that we could not refuse...\n\nAnyway, it arrives and sucks a big ball of boconcini. My buddy doesn't like it one bit but he comes from the \""shut the f-up and be polite\"" school. I don't. Or as our waiter would say...\""I dosn't\"".\n\nI tell Senor Linguini that I don't like it and I want the Filet Mignon instead. Well, let me tell you, he was not a happy fake-Italian Mama-Mia camper after this.\n\nAbout 45-50 minutes later, once everyone was done and ready to leave - my steak arrives. Hmmmmmm. Was it good? Um. Ok. But all the food here that the 4 of us ate was generally craptastic. But the big issue was our waiter - Frederico Flintstoni - who seemed to think that he was amusing throwing out this condescending attitude and looking at us like we knew nothing of Italy. \n\nShockingly, I happen to know that Michelangelo was not a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle contrary to popular belief because I Iived in this country he slandered with his ridiculous personality.\n\nNext time, he should just get a monkey and a music box and be done with it. Oh yah, and expensive as a golden cannoli! Stay the bada bing away or you will want to sleep with the fishes, I guaranteez it...\n\nI feel like I should end with a Godather quote...\""I know that it was you Fake Italian Waiter...You broke my heart...you broke my heart...\"""
4,"My new favorite Hookah Lounge. Large leather couches. Very clean, very new. Nice menu service. Pay as you leave. $10 a hookah per 3 people. Large selection of sheesh. Huge tv's that play sports on silent, while modern melodic rap music plays over high quality speakers. Nice selections of snacks too. The tables light up as well. Very peaceful unlike those other half-minded loud hookah lounges around town."

3,"We were fans of the Scottsdale location and now we go to the Biltmore Blanco at least once a month...\nMy kids don't eat Mexican but they have burgers and fries in the kids menu so that takes care of that (I know, leave them home, right?).\nLove, love, LOVE the shrimp cheese crisp with grilled corn to start.  The chips and salsa are perfect because my hubbie and I both enjoy it (rarely do we agree on salsa; this has more of a smoky flavor than spicy).\nAnd I've now tried every style of street taco and I love them all so I just close my eyes and choose 3 different ones each visit; they never disappoint.  You can mix it up with sweet, smoky and spicy--all great and not too filling.\nMy only complaint is the somewhat high prices and sometimes slow bar service..."
0,"I have found some bargains at Ross Dress For Less at Boca Park in Las Vegas however, the customer service is ALWAYS terrible. Most of the sales associates can't understand me because I speak fluent English. They are NEVER able to help me find anything because after all......they just WORK there.  Today, my son and I asked a gentleman if they had any Bow Ties. He was absolutly clueless as to what I was asking. Instead of helping me locate them or asking another associate he said he didn't know and then proceeded to point to a table with women's jewelry and said they were right there. I told him that a bow tie was a man's item and he shrugged his shoulders and walked off!"
2,"Dos y dos, carne taco, taco sampler, fried banana, tres leches.  Lots of food for the price paid."
3,Great food my only complaint will be the booths are very small.  If you have a medium sized belly it will be resting on the table.
4,"Very clean & highly recommended nail salon. Theyre all pretty friendly!! My nails always looks fabulous when I leave their salon!!! Go check them out!!! Tweety is so sweet, always smiling!!!"
1,"We arrived to the quaint little street just past Old Town and it was immediately charming, lined with attractive businesses and lit by the glow of twinkling lights strung across the lane, with the retro-awesomeness of Valley Ho looming at the end of the street. The parking scenario is not pleasant -there was a  vacant,ghetto-ish valet stand propped haphazardly out into the street. We did a quick driveby just in case regular parking became evident elsewhere, but eventually gave up and returned to valet. It was difficult to tell where we needed to pull up, and then we waited a significant amount of time before finally being greeted by the valet. The valet himself was curt and unfriendly, and when we returned at the end of the night we once again had to wait an interminable amount of time before we were finally able to get our car. Anyway, we meandered past the lovely garden to the hostess stand, where we were greeted and advised that there would be a wait for a patio table. We're not typically picky about where we sit, so we suggested we'd sit inside if they had tables ready? They did, so we did. \n\nAfter being seated on a banquette at a 4-top table in close proximity to other diners, our server swung by to say hello. It was pretty obvious from the outset that our server was new - she just didn't quite have the polish that the setting (and prices) set the stage for. She gave us a very short explanation of the restaurant (second oldest house in Scottsdale) and took drink orders. We picked up a little bit more information from the server taking care of the table beside ours, who animatedly launched into a detailed description of some of the history and the concept of the restaurant. It sounded interesting!\n\nOur appetizers came out very quickly : I had just quietly commented to my husband that it made me sad that nice restaurants which are at least slightly French-influenced don't send amuse bouches anymore when ta-da! Out came an Amuse Bouche from the Chef: Cheese Puffs that were delicious. It was very nice and obviously I had to eat my words :) BUT it was weird that they came out after we had recieved and started on our appetizer - it was the first of some strange pacing issues during our visit. amuse bouche = yummy. Now, back to the appetizers! The House Brisket was generally tasty, although the temperature was cold (how is that possible? We had just ordered and it came out so quickly!) and they were difficult to eat - the portions weren't single bites, but they were tough to cut into and divide into smaller bites as everything just sortof pulled apart. The meatballs: When I think duck confit, I think juicy, fatty and flavor packed deliciousness. These were a bit dry, and the sauce was very thin and difficult to sop up to offset the dryness. They tasted okay but were generally a bit disappointing. \n\nEntrees: My Filet was alright - it was cooked to temperature (medium) properly and the accompanying sauce had nice flavor. The corn on the plate seemed like a bit of a throwaway; I always enjoy sweet corn in summer dishes, but this seemed to just be a filler. My husband's braised pork was amazing - the accompanying apple and grits were just perfect and it was one of my favorite parts of the meal. The Basil and Brie Smashed Potatoes were also a let down - the potatoes themselves were very basic fingerling potatoes with little to no flavor, and they were just smashed a little (I was expecting something a bit more mashed or perhaps crispy) Admittedly, Brie is not my favorite and so I avoided that element of the dish, so perhaps I was missing out on the most important flavor component..\n\nMy dessert was delightful - a pear (or apple? I'm pretty sure it was pear) upside down cake that was just so tasty. I'd go back just for that. My husband's chocolate banana budino was okay, but not super exciting. There didn't seem to be any banana to speak of, so it was basically a quality chocolate pudding. \n\nI had mentioned pacing, our food came out so incredibly quickly, we were actually in and out of the restaurant with three courses in an hour and 15 minutes. I feel a little strange complaining about getting our food quickly, but it just seemed rushed, first with the amuse bouche and appetizers at the same time, and then followed by the rest of the courses hitting us so quickly one after the other. It is the sort of meal you want to linger over, but I felt a bit pushed to finish by the way that it was paced.\n\nThe atmosphere was a combination of nice and not-so-nice. They've done a wonderful job of transitioning the house into a beautifully furnished restaurant. . I didn't love the closeness to the other diners, especially the bachelorette parties in front of and beside us that got rowdier as the night wore on (general screechiness and shot-taking does not make for a romantic evening) The club-like music was out of character for the otherwise upscale and serious setting. \n\nIt was weird, maybe we'll try again."
2,"The price i saw listed online was $35 or so, but it's actually like $49 unless you're a member of the Rio players club. So here's the deal. Like most people, I was drawn here by the promise of lobster and crab on a buffet. There's a lot of other good food on the Village roster, but if you're going for the crab and lobster, you should know that the lobster are some kind of mini lobster I'm guessing caught by the Keebler elves on a fishing trip.  Sorry. Actually, i didn't mind that they were small. There was at least one good sized bite of lobster in each split tail and they were easy to remove meat from shell. The lobster didn't have a good flavor at all. Many were over cooked. It almost felt like they prepared them to be good enough to taste somewhat like lobster, but not so good that people would want to eat tons. If your passion is lobster, you'll be disappointed i think. \n\nIf you love crab, like I love crab, you should be very happy. It's snow crab, so you'll have to work for it, but the flavor was great. i would have come just for the crab. I would go back for more. The desserts were also very good. A full Gelato bar, etc. \nI gave them a 3 because i think if you're going to offer something, that you know will be a primary draw, you should make the effort to make sure it's at least passable in quality. Still loved the crab. What a magical beast they are!\n\nA side note about \""All you can eat venues\"": Every time I eat \""all i can eat\"" I end up eating exactly that; all that I can humanly eat. Never all that I should eat, but all that I can. This is not good for anyone. I suppose it's O.K. in moderation like the rest of Vegas."
0,"PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS EXHIBIT!!  \n\nFor the following reasons...\n\n*These are real human corpses that were NOT donated.  \n\n*All of the bodies come from china from plastination plants and sold for as little as $300 each for exportation.\n\n*The bodies used are \""unclaimed bodies\""....therefore these people didn't volunteer their body to be displayed for people to gawk at.  It is also highly likely that people were not notified of their loved ones death/body so it could be sold to the plastination industry that has developed in China.  Also, these bodies could be from tortured prisoners or political prisoners.  \n\n*Tickets go anywhere from $25-35 & all of the proceeds go towards the company (Premier Exhibitions) and a middle man from China who is running these plastination plants.\n\nUnfortunately, I did not know all of the above when I went to see this exhibit.  I have to admit that these are the best dissections and preserved specimens that I have ever seen...BUT after many questions that I had after this exhibit....where did the bodies come from?  Who in their right mind will consent to their conjoined twin to be displayed?  Where are the proceeds going?  Where did the fetus' come from?  I did my research & was appalled by what I found.  Leaving me feeling guilty of contributing to the chinese plastination industry & body extortion....\n\nSo PLEASE DON'T SEE THIS EXHIBIT...if you care about human rights."
0,"service is too slow. And the restrount is overpriced. The most ridiculous thing is when I give 10% tip, the japaness waitress give the money back to me and ask for at least 15% tip. This is the first time I was asked for more tip. Especially for the sooooo slow service, how can she ask for more tip? Oh maybe she know this is the last time we came to this bad restaurant, so she doesn't care."
2,"This restaurant has been open for about 7 months in my old 'hood in Scottsdale in the Sonora shopping mall off the 101 and FLW between the Best Buy and Staples. The restuarant has a sister location in Mesa.\nThe owners are Thai.\n \nThe decor is clean, neat, almost quaint, and without a lot of Thai decorative influences. They do play a sort of Ttradional Thai melodies meets New Age Relaxation type CD, and it is relaxing. \n\nI came for lunch. They run 10 lunch specials for $6.95, which includes a side salad of romaine and carrot strips with a light soy/sesame dressing. To satisfy the mostly Caucasian Scottsdale neighborhood, the choices are part Chinese (Orange Chicken, Kung Pao), Japanese (Chicken Teriyaki) and Thai (Pad Thai, Panang).\n\nI had Panang Chicken curry, which came with your choice of fried or steamed rice (steamed Jasmine). The curry comes in your preferred spice level from 1 to 5. Pick 3, which is about right for most. The curry had a nice flavor, with nice small pieces of chicken with juliened red bell peppers. I added a Thai iced tea to drink for $2. \n\nThey have the usual colors of curries, all about $10, soups like Tom Yum Koong, Salads like Yum Woon Sen, Larb, and Papaya, and noodles like Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, and Rad Nar. \n\nA bit Americanized, but tasty and very reasonable. There are few choices for Thai in Scottsdale, so if you have craving, try this one."
3,"The food was good, would have given 5 stars,but our server Manny was a little rude and inpatient. Manny did seem to pull it together when he took our order for dinner. Overall I recommend for good tasting Mexican food,but management needs to teach Manny some manners."
2,"Disclaimer.... I am not a traditional New York style pizza fan. \n\nWith that said this pizza was \""traditional style NY pizza\"" \n\nThe joint was a little busy but not slammed, the service was decent but not great. The pizza was good but not the excellent. The price and portion size was right on. \n\nI had a pep and a sausage. The slices are about the size of 8x11 sheet of paper tapered in at the bottom. Dripping with grease. \n\nThe crust is a thin crust, obviously, but seemed to lack any flavor. The pizza folded well and held the topping and grease as it should. The thicker end was decent, just a little too crispy for me. \n\nThey do have a ton of options. Salads, pastas, cal zones, sandwiches, etc. I will be back but maybe for pasta instead."

3,"The softball size meatballs is a must have! I usually don't like meatballs, but this is so delicious, you have to order it. It comes with two in one order, but thy are big enough to share if you are ordering it as a side."
4,"This is the 2nd Capriotti's that I have visited. As always the food is 5-stars but I was disappointed that they only offer bottled soda. The location on Craig Rd has a soda fountain and you can get a refill on your drink at no charge. Their prices on chips and drinks is not worth it. The deserts are okay for the price. The staff are nice but the place looks a bit dumpy. Although, I must admit, I go in for the sandwiches and they are great so nothing else matters."
0,"Unfortunately, the district manager has confirmed that this location was shuttered on Sunday, 9/1/13.  I had just started going here about three weeks ago and the place was starting to grow on me in a weird sort of  way.  The first time I went was for the Tuesday $2 for any draft beer day, and that was pretty good except for the short pour beers which I thought maybe was just a fluke and not an everyday occurence.  Joined their on line club and went back the following week to redeem the free burger coupon you get upon joining.  The server switched my burger with someone elses's and gave us both 1/2 off, so I saved the free burger coupon for next time.  The next (and it turns out the last) time I went was 8/29, because I received a coupon for a $5 burger to celebrate the start of the college football season.  I should have known it was the \""beginning of the end\"" when I walked in about 3:15 pm and nobody was behind the bar, and the North Carolina-South Carolina game that they were hyping for the start of college football season was not on any of the many TV's in the place.  After about 5-10 minutes a bartender appeared and I got my usual short pour draft.  I presented the $5 coupon and ordered a burger which came out way more done than the medium I ordered.  Was too hungry to complain but when the bill came they had applied my free burger credit from the on-line membership  that I was saving instead of the $5 coupon I had presented.  The manager said he couldn't re-load the free burger credit to my card, so he hand wrote a card \""good for any sandwich or burger\"" that I could use on a future visit and commented how instead of getting a $5 burger today, I got a free one and still had a free one coming.  Like I said, this place was starting to grow on me because of all of their rather comical screw-ups.  The last laugh is on them, however, because I guess I have to go to Peoria if I want to redeem my \""free sandwich or burger\"" card."
1,"We ate at Carrabba's in Chandler last night. It was okay, but I have had better. The service left a lot to be desired. The server was pleasant enough, but neglected to advise me that they do not have green peppers to put on my pizza. The entire table heard me, so when my pizza came out it was covered with pepperocini. I sent it back, and they remade it, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). One can get much better pizza and service at Nello's a few miles away, or Humble Pie. It will be a long time before I go to Carrabba's again."
2,"I've gone to this store more than a handful of times. I usually stop in for their ribbon, and die-cuts since I do not own a cricut machine. The times I've been in employees have been friendly and I never have to wait to get rung up. You can also sign up for their email list which shows monthly promotions and current classes youc an sign up for.\n\nI will be returning in the future."
1,"I was pretty disappointed in the buffet at TI.  I wasn't expecting gourmet, but I was definitely expecting better than I received.  Just like any other Vegas buffet, there was a line but it wasn't too long (maybe that should have been a clue..).  The place is nicely laid out and there was plenty of seating (another sign).\n\nWhen I go to a buffet, I just don't start grabbing food.  I like to cruise the entire buffet to see what my choices are so then I know how to handle portion control.  And I never start eating without checking out the dessert section so I know how much room to save.  Needless to say, I was disappointed in the dessert options so that almost immediately ruined the whole buffet for me.  Luckily I wasn't paying so that managed to keep me open minded enough to eat.  The food should at least look freshly prepared but much of what I saw looked like it sat under the heat lamps for most of the night, and it wasn't even that late yet.\n\nIt'll fill you up and the price isn't ridiculous, but I prefer the buffet at Bellagio.  Unless someone else is paying, I probably won't return."
2,"Great room.  Good food.  Like most higher-end Vegas restaurants Eureole will give you consistantly good, not great, food.  And like most higher-end Vegas restaurants, you'll pay out the nose for it.  It's a fun place to go if someone else is paying."
1,Usually can't mess up breakfast too bad. What was made was half-way decent. Problem was the order was wrong. Asked for White Chicolate Chip Pancakes. Got regular. Asked for extra sausage on my lumberjack breakfast instead of ham. Messed that up too. Smh. Better than my last Denny's experience though. Wish there was a 24 hour place better. Vegas needs an Eat N' Park.
0,"I booked a vacation through Southwest. that included a free buffet at Aria. I loved the rooms at Aria, but the buffet was terrible. If I eat at a buffet in Vegas, I usually go to to the buffet at Wynn, which is excellent. The prime rib at the Aria was more like a Sunday night roast, and the rest of the entrees were marginal at best. I thought the food and service was so bad that I would not  eat there again even if they offered it for free. Maybe that's the reason they included the free buffet as part of the vacation package! Really disappointed in the quality and service for such a nice hotel."
2,"Good place to eat or get a beer for happy hour. They have many classic Irish dishes, burgers, and sandwiches. Sweet potato fries are quite tasty. Nice location right on Mill Avenue with patio."
2,"this place is decent. i get to-go for dinner a lot when i'm at work since all of downtown phoenix closes at like 3. the athenian spaghetti is awesome, and so is the white pizza. however, you never know what you'll get here. sometimes it completely sucks. i brought my lady here once and her falafels were harder than rocks.\n\nalso most of the food is way too expensive for what it is. 10 dollars for some spaghetti with a few herbs and some butter? \n\nryan is a great server though."
0,"This place seriously sucks.  There's nothing about it that says \""Irish bar\"" to me; nor Vegas.  Its brightly lit, boring, and still had Halloween decorations up and it was May.  We were on an all-you-can drink \""top shelf\"" liquor for two hours deal that included a big appetizer tray.  The alcohol selection here is horrible.  They had only one kind of scotch, refused to make us martinis (I guess those are above the top shelf?), and the appetizer tray was 100% deep fried and not good.  The waitress, Megan, was completely bitchy to us and said, \""Well its not like you're going to tip me ANYWAY.\""  What the hell?  Who says that?  Sorry you had a bad day or whatever.  \n\nWe all left pissed off and also complained to the company who had set us up to go here.  McFaddens won't be getting any more business from them and hopefully from a lot of other people that read this review as well.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!"
2,"No bar, no casino, no pool, no restaurant, $8 self parking. \n\nFine, nice holel rooms. But really no bar, no casino. \n\nKnock yourself out!"
3,Good club. Good music. Has two levels. On on the roof top. It has decent view of the strip on the roof. Normal high vegas priced drinks. Bartenders were cool. Wasn't a super long wait for how many people where there. Go VIP and you dont have to wait in a line long at all.
0,"I guess by now all you people are so used to the crappy Mexican in phoenix that you think this is the max.  I guess to each his own but my Idea of good Mexican is not soggy tortillas, food that tastes like cumin a trashy dump that is not clean, there is no way you can clean a place like this they make enough money to at least put in a decent floor, but trust me you eat what you see."
0,"Most of the time we get good pizza from this restaurant. However, the last three times we ordered chicken wings they were dry and almost inedible! I don't know what's gong on with this location lately, but these chicken wings AREN'T CHEAP, so if I'm going to pay top dollar for a dozen I should at least be able to bite into them. So my advice is order the pizza, it's pretty good, but the chicken wings HORRIBLE!!!!"
4,I love this place!!!!!!
1,"I really like Texas food.  Yeah, Tex-Mex for sure.  But, real Texas food... Texas BBQ!\n\nSo if you like genuine Texas BBQ, Hot Links, Pulled Pork, then look no further; this is your place. Everything, but beer as they say!\n\nWe've been here a few times now and have enjoyed their Brisket, Pulled Pork, and a number of their sausages items.  The sides are equally good, such as Fried Okra, Jalape\u00f1o Beans, Fried Onion Tanglers, and Creamy Coleslaw.  All good, A-Ok.  \n\nSo how do I rate Dickey's when Yelp gives you the choice of Two Stars (Meh. I've experienced better) or Three Stars (A-OK)?  Well the answer is, we would agree.  I'm sorry for the unintended pun, but both are true.  Have we enjoyed better?  Yep, Texas Roadhouse or Famous Dave's in Mesa comes to mind real quick.  So, is the food A-Ok?  Sure. Absolutely.\n\nSo what is Dickey's?   It's just a quick, inexpensive place when you feel like Texas BBQ, and not thirty minute drive to Mesa.  It works for what it is.  So 2 1/2 Stars!  Like I said, everything but beer."
3,"Simply marvelous spot. This is a must for all FLW fans or fans of architecture or fans of art or fans of nature or.....\nAlways led by a tour guide because the school of Arch is fully operating and students are all about. The 90 minute tour may seem like an investment of time, but its well worth it and flies by.\nLoved it"
2,"You should come here to check out their happy hour, which goes until 7 PM.  \nGreat specials, especially the drinks.\n\nService is great.  Our waitress was very friendly.  \n\nThe food was unfortunately pretty subpar.  We tried a flatbread, buffalo wings, and a quesadilla.  All of it was decent at best, and we even had to send back the flatbread because we were so disappointed.  \n\nI would recommend this for grabbing a drink before or after a movie at Harkins.\nI wouldn't recommend eating here."
0,"I stayed here 16 years ago when it was a resort. Not sure what to call it now. Lets review the stay:\nChecked into room. Before entering, there was an empty glass right by our door. Every time we entered and exited, we always saw the same glass. We left hotel two days later, and still... same glass in hall.\nThe room REEKED of smoke. I called the front desk to change rooms. I was told rudely that the hotel was full because of a body builder convention. But they would call me the next day so they could change my room. They never called. I called them instead. They gave me the same excuse.\nWhen we went to bed, we went to deadbolt the door. The swinging lock on the door was previously shattered in two. Unusable. Then my wife touched it and the device broke off the door and into her hand. I looked at the metal, and it had a clean cut, which means someone in the hotel, I hope, had to cut into the room with lock cutters.\nThe toilet didn't stop running.  The shower constantly had a flow.\nThere were empty bottles under the bed. \nThe 24 hour coffee shop was replaced by previously prepared sandwich and coffee house. I had the last sandwich they had, 1am, and it was horribly over priced. No fries, no chips. Just sandwich in plastic container. \nDuring day and night, this sold out hotel's casino was DEAD EMPTY. \nCould not get an internet signal on the 5th floor. Yet they still charged me a resort fee.\nEvery one leaves the comment that you get what you pay for. I got much less."
1,"This review is probably a bit outdated, since the first and last time I had Holsteins was in June 2012. We decided to drop by here for a quick lunch before Marquee Dayclub, since it's right outside Marquee's main entrance on the 2nd level. For some reason or another, we decided to sit in the bar and lounge area, instead of the dining area. The lounge had a few couches and chairs and we found a spot that fit seven of us. The rest of our group decided to sit at the bar.\n\nNot all of us ate, and I honestly don't even remember if I had a burger or not. If I did, it was obviously pretty unmemorable. I do remember getting fries and those were pretty standard. I also remember the service being on the poor side, but it wasn't a big deal. At that time, if you checked in on Foursquare, you could get a free pint of beer. Our server said all 10 of us had to check in and show him the check-in for us to get it. Not all of us had Foursquare or cell service, so that was kind of irritating and inefficient. I mean, technically he didn't do anything wrong, but you know there are always those servers who are more lax and will get you the freebie without actually seeing the check-in. This guy was not one of those servers.\n\nEvery time I pass by Holsteins since then, I get bad vibes so I doubt I'd ever come back, unless it's for convenience. If I'm going to Dayclub, I'd rather get bottle service and food from Marquee, which is surprisingly tasty, than eat at Holsteins again."
4,"This is easily one of the best local pizza places in Phoenix. Great staff, quick service, and quality food. Awesome menu with great prices. Coming from Boston its hard to find good pizza here in Phoenix, but knowing that you can go to a local-non chain pizza place with good food that is close by is perfect. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,"Ordered the shrimp spring rolls.\nI enjoyed the warm noodles, shrimp seemed old, veggies were a good mix, nothing bitter. Good nonetheless.\n\nOrdered the Bo Luc Lac\nWasn't bad. A bit on the salty side, but rice comes with it so that helps.\n\nNothing better than Orange County yet. \nA good temp replacement."
1,"My son is 4 and has been going here for 6 months and absolutely hates it. Teachers are short with the children and inattentive. He got severely hurt by putting his tooth through his lip and they never even called me. He cries every day when I drop him off and we are  currently looking for a new preschool. Also, it's the most expensive school around."
3,"After a day spent shopping with the kids, I decided to take them out for a treat. Ohhh who am I kidding it was mostly because I've been wanting to try this place out hahaha. The place was minimal but very clean, service was very prompt and friendly. So I got the sticky rice with mangoes for me (it was delicious! I wish I had asked for more coconut sauce on the side though) A strawberry and banana with nutella crepe for my daughter and a root beer float for my son (this one I'm kinda iffy about, it's $5.00 for a regular sized float with nothing but just that)\n\nLast night we went back for some more sticky rice and mangoes but sadly we were informed that mango season is over and that they wont be offering that anymore. BOOOO! Oh well until next year then, but we will certainly be back to try their other goodies."
1,"Shopping a department store during the holidays and Yelp's Shop Local Pledge? \nFOR SHAME!\nBut hear me out, there are some things I simply can't find shopping the little guys. (Apologies to the entire small business community but I plan to spend some dough with you guys too!) \nNot really much to say about the place outside from the fact that it's a hot mess. At least in the men's section everything is way too close together, It's so hard to tell what collection goes with what, and bright red signs make you think things are on sale, but they're not. Use those little scanner thingies to check before you make your way to the cashier. I know during the holiday season you have to cut these guys some slack, we're lucky that everything is on a table or hanging and not laying on the floor right? Eh, I guess so. But I'm always prepared to spend more than I actually do at places like this because it's so hard to navigate and I wind up gettin' the sweats and have to leave."
1,Sorry... can't get over the teaspoon of orange juice.
2,"Everyone said to go to LAVO on Sunday's because it's usually packed. Yeah, it's packed alright! My friends and I received FREE admission because we were staying at the Venetian. It was nicely decorated. But the place was too small. There were FREE drinks for females until 11pm, which is great. You have to tip the bartenders so they keep coming back to serve you. \n\nA couple steps down is the dance floor. Trust me, this place is very, very, very small. It was packed with people when I went and maybe that's because of the small venue. It was really hard to dance and have fun with people next to you, at least shoulder apart.\n\nIf you're looking for a bigger dance floor with multiple bars, try going to TAO, XS, Marquee, etc."
2,"Harold's is worth the drive up north if you're looking for a good 'ol country / biker bar to drink beer, listen to country music, and/or watch Steelers games... It's a huge space with several rooms inside and a great big outdoor patio too.  Up until my most recent visit, I might have told you that the service and food were pretty consistent too... but unfortunately, both the service and food sucked during our last visit!\n\nSince I've been going to Harold's for years though, I'm sticking to a 3 star review in hopes that our last experience was a fluke. In the past, I've enjoyed both the beef ribs and the salmon entrees at Harold's.  I went for a steak salad last visit and was extremely disappointed - it was pretty nasty. I also found it funny that when my bf asked about the soup of the day, the waitress said it was 'clam chowder' and that it was 'good when fresh' but she didn't recommend it the day we were there... huh, that kinda makes you wonder?!\n\nHarold's does offer steamed broccoli as well as plenty of other side items including french fries, coleslaw, baked potato, and more.  Their menu is huge with something for everyone, but I think Nadia C has the right idea in going to Harold's for beer and burgers!"
1,"I think this is a place to go late at night / early in the morning hours. We were there for dinner, and nobody really liked what they had. The gyro sandwiches were just ok. The bruschetta wasn't very good. The garlic bread for it wasn't v. garlicky, and it was cold. The spinach salad was old spinach leaves, and tasteless bacon bits. We were there for an early dinner. I know we disappointed the cocktail waitress because we didn't order."
1,"There is one reason why I gave this place the extra star, the food here is excellent, although I do suggest getting it to go due to the lack of good service. But I'd rather spend my money elsewhere where the business cares about the customer, afterall we are the reason they stay open. \nWaiters/waitresses need to know their boundaries as to what type of remarks to have to say to their guests. Obviously in this atmosphere neither their front of house staff nor the owner cares what we think of how they treat us. I had invited my best friend here for a lovely lunch and instead had an overall bad experience. We were very disappointed in the service and how the owner handled it...\nI just won't be returning."
0,Did not enjoy living here.  A very badly designed residential complex.
1,Eh I wasn't impressed. I enjoy the atmosphere in Orlando better. We sat in the bar and the server seemed disinterested in serving us. We arrived an hour before they closed which was really early for Vegas and he told us three times within the hour that they closed soon. It was like Dude we get the message we will leave your table in time for you to go home. The drinks we got were great but not proportioned to the price.
2,"I came here last April and my boyfriend at the time always came here for business and raved how great it was . So when we went I was all excited..My excitement became \""meh\"". The steak was not the greatest..maybe it was an off day. The frisee' salad was amazingggg though as well as the monkey bread dessert but it wasn't good enough to return for me."
1,"I really want to like The Vig business. They always find a way to irritate me when I visit. Came on a slow Wednesday evening about Happy Hour time, the place was pretty slow. I had my small (well behaved) dog with me (on a very short leash).\n\nI walk to a table on the patio in the sunshine while my friend let the hostess know that we were sitting outside. She promptly rushed out at me as if I were trying to steall the patio decor, and told me that dogs were not allowed.\n\nI apologized and turned to leave when the manager came out and directed us to a small table at the very edge of the property. Thanks for letting us stay......... I guess.\n\nWe settled in and ordered a bottle of wine (our waitress was no help and knew little about their wine selection). Ordered the humus plate with was also \""Just ok\""\n\nAll in all.... I am still not happy with the brand after being to all the locations. \n\nAnd the humus made me throw up the next morning.......\n\n\nThanks for the closure Vig."
4,Ok I love pizza but have to eat gluten-free.  Even though super fast food type it is by far best gluten-free pizza. Trust me I try everywhere.  I love so many choices and so fast at a great price. Makes me happy!
1,"Fast gunsmith service (1 1/2 weeks), did not do what I requested, sloppy cosmetic work.  \n\nI really wanted to write a glowing review.  I bought a 12 gauge shotgun from Guns Etc. for 3 gun competition some months ago.  That was a pretty good experience.  \n\nI asked to have ghost ring sights installed.  The rear sight requires drilling and tapping the receiver.  The barrel rib has to be cut back to mount the front sight.  Not an easy install, but that's why I took it to an experienced gunsmith.  \n\nGun forums recommend adding a cross pin to secure the front sight to augment the epoxy provided by the mfg.  I asked for that but it did not happen.  A note on the service ticket said \""Don't know about the pin.\""  A call to discuss would have worked.  The clerk said if a pin had been necessary the gunsmith would have used one.  Sorry I'm so stupid, but I asked for the service and intended to pay for it.  It may not matter.  Guess I will find out.  The front sight is rotated a little off center.  I was able to use the rear sight adjustment to correct for the slight misalignment.\n\nEpoxy streaks on the side of the front sight is sloppy but only cosmetic.  Two stars for doing a fast install.  Poor communication and not doing the job as requested is a problem."
1,"Wanted to love this place.... Fast, close to home, and great Yelp reviews.  Alas, it was not to be...\nGot the Red Curry lunch with veggies, tofu, and brown rice. They had a great variety of veggies and they were cooked perfectly. Not limp, crispy without being too raw. Brown rice was perfectly cooked as well. Trouble was the curry. There was a layer of sauce on the veggies, as opposed to it swimming in curry. Which would have been fine except that there was a gritty texture, no silky coconut milk, no hint of fish sauce, and NO FLAVOR. There was not even a hint of heat, nor any other discernible spice notes. When has a curry ever been bland? I'm the wrong person to ask. I guess.\nI also tried the chicken pot stickers. They wrappers had a weird texture, the filling was super bland, and the sauce they came with was just thin, sweet, and totally forgettable. \n\nDecor was inviting, it seemed clean, and the staff seemed fine (ordered carry out, my order was waiting for me when I got there, both the guy on the phone and the gal on the register seemed competent & friendly-ish)...\nI may be back the next time my son bugs me for Pei Wei. :)"
2,"One of the only dependable computer shops this end of the city, Silicon is a bit of a lifesaver for the west enders. \n\nI've never been in here for a Repair but I hear they are good, I'm also told that they will custom build whatever kind of computer your looking for.\n\nWhy such an average score then? The price of all the Accessories is a little high, especially compared with what you can get online. So go here if your computers busted, Amazon when you need anything else."
3,"Lo-Lo's is a nice experience in southern cooking without leaving Phoenix. You can see why everyone raves about the place.\n\nThree of us came here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed ourselves.  The only drawback was that we arrived at 8:15am. Yelp had the opening listed incorrectly as 7 am.  Lo-Lo's  OPENS AT 9 AM! I have posted a updated photo, with the correct times from the front door.\n\nWe ordered two coffees and a iced \""fruit punch\"" Kool-Aid for $3.00 each to start. I had the #8 Betty Boop for $8.00. It comes with one piece of southern fried chicken breast, along with a plate covering waffle. It wasn't bad, but mine was a little mushy and didn't stand up well to the syrup. \n\nAs for the chicken, I regret that it was somewhat dry and not juicy. The smashed sides of two sausage paddies for $2.00 was great and it had a nice flavor.  I would come back just for the smashed sausages and Kool-Aid anytime!\n\nMy two friends ordered the #14 CJ's, which is one waffle, one egg, and a small bowl of grits for only $6.00 (a steal); and the #11 Kimbo for $7.00, which is two giant waffles. My friend reported that his waffles were cooked longer and they looked golden brown. \n\nSpending some time in the south, I really miss having Grits. Oatmeal is not the same thing. The Grits at Lo-Lo's are very good. If you have never tried them before, Lo-Lo's would be a good introduction. But skip the cheese on top. The best I've ever enjoyed came with small pieces of bacon in it. Yum! Now, which way is the Mayo Clinic? LOL\n\nOur bill for three including taxes, but before gratuities ran us $34.86. Overall the food and service was very good. I would say Three and Half Stars good, rounding up to Four."
0,"We were incredibly disappointed with the food here. We ordered oysters (at least they were fresh and hard to screw up), steak tartare which was pre-made and fairly tasteless. Then we has the duck which was again nothing to write home about and the mussels. Let me wax poetic about these mussels. They came with chorizo which was minced and sprinkled over the mussels. It looked like the mussels threw up on themselves. Then all I could taste was the chorizo which made the broth incredibly oily and the chorizo didn't even taste good. I would have forsaken the seafood flavor for the sausage (as I do love sausage) but quite honestly this was gross. I would never go back. One plus is that we had a nice waitress. Don't bother to eat here."
2,"I liked La Feria slightly more as a store than as a place to eat.  Even though I didn't buy anything, Bob was interested in a toucan ocarina, and I fantasized about affording a bright orange wooden lobster for my wall.  I also loved the tapestries, the retablos, and the Dia de los Muertos statues.\n\nAs for the food, it was pretty good, but I am on the picky side.  In fact, the whole meal was good, with one or two things keeping it shy of great.  We split two specials, one beef and one chicken, and both meats were a bit dry.   We had two empanadas, one spinach/feta and one ground beef.  The fillings were excellent, though they were (sadly!) understuffed.  \n\nFor dessert we tried the Alfajores, and this was the weakest part of the experience.  The pasty flavor of the thick shortbread cookies completely overwhelmed the mild sweetness of the dulce de leche.  I spent every bite trying to find it, to no avail.\n\nIt was a decent amount of food, though not as much as you'd expect for 10 dollars a person (we split the 20 dollar plate).\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it's cute, but cramped.  There's tons to look at while you're waiting a short time for your food.  The service wasn't too great: the waitress forgot our limeade.  But they were friendly enough, so I can't complain.\n\nHere's the thing: in Pittsburgh, your pickings in South American food are very slim.  While this might sound like a negative review, it's not intended to be.  Until this area diversifies a bit more (currently at 2% Hispanic), or somehow finds more demand for good, authentic South American cuisine, I highly recommend checking La Feria out.  It's not perfect, but it'll do."
2,"I love the beer selection, the service is great, and it's a beautiful spot.  On a mild Phoenix day when they have all the sliding doors opened up its a great place to hang out.\n\nThe happy hour isn't bad either.\n\nThat being said the food just seems \""meh\"" so far.  I just can't really get into it.  I've been there a few times and I'll probably keep going back but I haven't found anything yet that I just can't wait to bite into."
4,"My favorite place to eat in Madison. Amazing Turkish food for very reasonable prices. Everyone I take here enjoys the meal, even if they've never eaten Mediterranean before.\n\nThe Lamb Curry is to die for. \nI also enjoy the Turkish coffee."
0,Lame ass expensive place. Flavors are too sweet nd are so artificial. Place is crowded nd small nd loud inside
2,I've seen Kooza and Ovo in my hometown and they were awesome. So why not see the Cirq. while in Vegas. The tickets were more expensive because you had to buy them from the Treasure Island site. Total price for 2 was $237 after tx and fees. The thing i noticed right away was that the performers weren't nsync with their moves. In the previous performance i saw the performers moves were tight. We couldn't really grasp the story. Baby loses her ball? but didn't know how that tied into the other performers they had on stage. The rooster was awesome. The stunts were ok. My husband and I left wanting more and I regretted spending that much money on this show. It's good for someone's first Cirque du Soleil performance but not for those who seen other traveling shows. Also there is no intermission.
1,"Ate here once and that will probably be enough. There wasn't necessarily anything wrong with the burger, but at this price, you are pushing into \""gourmet\"" burger territory and gourmet this ain't.  Frankly this a step up in price from the Five Guys and In-N- Outs of the world and a noticeable step down in quality. As such, I can't say I really see a reason to eat here."
1,"The gentleman that helped my wife was not only argumentative but unable to correctly perform the service requested because they did not carry a complete line of the products needed.  After returning to request that they fix the nails, they disagreed with our issues and claimed that it is just the way it is. Not happy and wont return."
2,"My first visit to the Double Wide.  Simple Friday night - Steak, Pepper & Bacon Salad with a side of Sweet Potato Fries.\n\nTwo strikes on the salad:  Grasshopper pee on the lettuce (what we thought dead, wilted, brown leaves were when we were kids); and balsamic dressing that looks like brown gravy.  Um, yuk.  I will say that the steak, peppers and bacon were fine.\n\nSweet potato fries were angel-singing fabulous.  I requested bleu cheese, but the server suggested their sugar-cinammon dip and it was terrific.  She was so right.  Loved it.\n\nThe service was excellent: happy, helpful & quick.\n\nI might go back for the outdoor opportunity, but otherwise there's just no draw.\n\nAnother thing that made me chuckle - they weren't really busy but there were two guys handling the greeting and seating chart.  It looked like they were studying for an exam.  ...maybe they were and I'm being harsh..."
3,"I love staying at planet hollywood! The beautiful yet modern decor, the helpful staff, and the free bottle of alcohol also helped. Here are a few plus about the PH resort... \n\nRooms - Each room has a movie theme. We stayed in the Universal Solider room. My friends got to stay in the James Bond Room. Nice room with a big bathroom\n\nShopping- All my favorite stores... bebe, urban outfitters, H&M. \n\nRestaurants- Good solid  buffet in vegas. There is also Koi, Strip Steak, \nPH Cafe. There are also lots of choice in the mall\n\nPool - Private Pool for Hotel Guest only so its not too crowded. They also have beer pong tables."
3,love the locals discounts! Thursdays it's buy one get one free on well drinks with local ID
1,"Delicious food, appalling service. Waiter got the order wrong and left half of it off with no apologies. Never checked on us, drinks went dry. For such an expensive restaurant (which means huge tip) I expected a lot more. In fact somebody did come over to apologize for the delay on the food, but it wasn't our waiter. He never even acknowledged any of the mistakes! That's too bad, because the food was delicious."
2,"We visited this restaurant before heading on to see Snow White & the Huntsman at South Side Works. We wanted some place cheap and different from our usual steak/burgers/etc. fare.\n\nThai Me Up (what a stupid name) is small and there isn't much in the way of decor, but none of that really matters as it is also cheap eats. Altogether we had the lemon grass soup, a spring roll, pad thai and green curry with chicken and tofu and a side of steamed white rice.\n\nMy rice was soggy on the bottom, which is disturbing when I'm eating out. I can't cook rice to save my life, but, considering it should be rather simple and easy to prepare, it's a little scary when a restaurant can't get it right. The green curry was delicious, but my absolute favorite was the spring roll. This is surprising for me as I hate spring rolls, but the dipping sauce was amazingly good!\n\nThe lemongrass soup was also quite tasty and very different from any other soup I've had before. My boyfriend's pad thai was pretty good, though we've both had better elsewhere (can't really complain for the price, though).\n\nI'm only giving Thai Me Up 3 stars because, although the food was tasty, it left you wanting something more flavor-wise. Some of the items were threatening to veer into the bland side of the specturm. Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park was much more appealing, but the location leaves a lot to be desired. I recommend it for better thai food, but if you're looking to hang out in the south side and people watch or go out later, Thai Me Up is the perfect place for some quick, cheap eats."
3,"I would definitely want to go back to this buffet. The \""middle eastern section\"" was my favorite...they had grilled lamb and chicken. the chicken was very tender...but i think the lamb was overcooked. the section though was very complete...hummus...pita...basmati....baklava!\n\nAlso ventured into \""american\"" with prime rib and orange glazed duck......\""seafood\"" was the most popular with a line....crab legs, mussels...shrimp....crab stuffed sole.....the chinese wasn't that good--dumplings were dried out.....there were also tamales in 'mexican' but i didn't try it. there were also a couple of soups....but i think the desert bar had the most selection....cheesecakes....cakes....fruit.....i walked away with a fully belly and a pink cotton candy.\n\nall this for $30! def. more bang for ur buck."
1,"A few years ago I would have given this place a 4 or 5, but now it's brought itself to a 2.  Stupid bastards.  Apparently the management decided to keep the name \""Brewery\"" just because the warehouse-y space looks like a brewery.  Too bad they don't make their own micro-brews here anymore.  Our waitress, who was great, said that because the tram that connected the hotel to the Mirage was closed down, the brewery aspect of the restaurant was shut down, too.  Makes no sense to me, but it was a total buzz kill when she told us that we couldn't get the flight of house beers...the reason to go here!  The food is still good, but without the beers, it's just another American dining place.  Yeah, they play games on the projection screens and sometimes have live music acts.  But BRING BACK THE MICRO BREWS!  If you want craft beer, get a free Sam Adams from the girls in the casino instead."
4,Love it!  Everything is packed with nutrients and tastes even more amazing!  Great ratios!
1,"This is sub par Hawaiian. The meat was tough and stringy and there is only plastic silverware. The Macaroni salad has twice the amount of mayonnaise needed, the vegetables were cold. My stomach has been flipping all night after eating here. I have had better Hawaiian in the valley for much less. If you are ever in the neighborhood for Leo's, give that a try."
2,"I've heard about this place ever since I got to Pittsburgh and, for whatever reason, haven't had a chance to try it till yesterday. My first impressions were quite positive:\n\n- The decor is very trendy and reminded me of some favorite brunch places back in NYC.\n- There was a short wait (20 min) which would normally be a turn off, but Coca takes your cell phone number and calls you when your table is ready, leaving you the freedom to explore the boutiques lining Butler Ave. I really wish more restaurants would do this!\n- The banana bread and the zucchini bread (see photo) were fantastic! I highly recommend them. Whatever is in the butter that accompanies each must have crack in it b/c I couldn't stop eating it!\n- My girlfriend got the goat cheese stuffed french toast. Not the best stuffed french toast ever (head to Dozen for that...mmm...hungry just thinking about it), but very interesting and very tasty.\n\nSadly, though, that's where the greatness stopped. I ordered the smoked salmon omelet with the goat cheese and a side of sausages. It was, well, bland. The salmon wasn't very salmon'y, and the eggs weren't very egg'y. I don't know how to describe it other than \""blah\"". Oh, and my sausages were shaped liked meatballs and were completely flavorless. What gives?\n\nFor a place that I've heard nothing but good things about, this one feel a bit flat. And even as I write this, I'm torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars (damn you Yelp and your lack of 1/2 stars). On the one hand, the bread and my girl friend's dish were delicious. On the other hand, I could make my dish better with very minimal effort. So I think I'm going to leave it as a 3-star rating but with the caveat that if you order the right things, you might well give it a higher rating.\n\nGood luck in finding the right dish at this trendy, but underwhelming eatery."
2,"I'm not a fan of beer but I do like a good beer brat - go figure. Considering there is not another brat place in town (that I know of anyway) the boyfriend and I were happy to find out about Brat Haus. \n\nOn a Saturday night we took a seat on the Brat Haus patio. the seating is a little weird. There are a few long group tables, a few individual tables and then a lot of empty space. It wasn't super busy which made the empty space seem even more, well, empty. Kinda weird.\n\nWe each ordered a traditional beer brat with root beer onions and an order of pretzels to share. The pretzels came out first. Man, those are some girthy pretzels. Not sure if they are whole wheat but they are much heartier that what you get at Auntie Anne's that's for sure. They came with 3 types of mustard and a beer cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was just okay. It was kinda thin and a little bland. The waitress did ask our opinion though and we told her what we thought. It was nice to know they are open to improvements and want customer feedback.\n\nNext up were the brats. They are huge! After the filing pretzels we could have easily shared one brat. The bun was more like french bread, which made for a little too much bread around the meat. But i will say I'm not a big fan of onions and I really like the root beer onions. It was a very nice complement to the brat. The brat itself was good, not amazing but good. It also came with a few pickled green beans which were a surprising nice flavor combination with the meat. \n\nOverall the staff was very nice, the food was decent and in the winter I think it'll be a great place to hang out outside. If you like beer and brats it's worth stopping by."
1,"They don't offer the all you can eat deal anymore. My husband and I had stopped by because we wanted to try a new sushi spot. It wasn't that busy but after waiting 45 minutes for 2 rolls, our patience ran out and we left. The staff seems nice and the rolls looked good, but I wouldn't be able to tell you how it tasted."
0,"Our family made a bad decision to grab dinner here and it will not happen again!  Out of four of us, no one finished their meal - they were barely edible.  The chicken and vegetables tasted frozen/thawed/old and the egg rolls were... well, just plain gross.  I usually prefer to write positive reviews, but I just can't for this place."
3,"Came here today based on the reviews. Food was very good, big portions and finally real hash browns that taste good!\nFour star because our poor waitress was racing around seemingly because the other server seemed to be lazing around..."
4,"We, meaning a group of  neighbors go to Barro's every Monday night.  We get great service and love the folks work there.  The food is excellent and we are really treated right.  We use to go to one of their competitors but switched to Barro's about a year ago.  Thinking about pizza, wings, or pasta........ stop thinking and go to Barro's.\n\n                                     My best to the folks there,    Paul"
3,"This place is a solid 3.5 stars in terms of quality of the room, pool, etc, but the great rate I got is going to bump it up to a 4!\n\nThis was my first time staying at the Monte Carlo. The staff we encountered (valet, front desk, etc.) were all very courteous and helpful. Our room was decent size, clean and for the most part comfortable. I may have high expectations when it comes to linens *SNOB ALERT*, I prefer down comforters and pillows, so I was slightly disappointed that they had neither. I also have had back problems, and this mattress was a little too soft for me, but I'm sure comfortable for \""normal\"" people =)  Other than that the temperature was easily adjustable to our preferences, the A/C didn't turn the room into a meat locker. \n\nOne of the reasons I wanted to stay here was I've been longing to spend some time in a lazy river, and according to their site, they have one. Perhaps I'll need to head to Raging Waters to satisfy that longing,  because what I was envisioning wasn't quite what was at the Monte Carlo. It's on the small side, and I wasn't willing to shell out $12 for a tube rental. Either way, my bf and I enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi. The pool area is clean despite it being very crowded on that particular Sunday afternoon. \n\nThe sweet rate I got was thanks to my MGM players club, I get emails on occasion from their casino marketing team, which you have to call in to take advantage of as opposed to booking online. I'm no high roller when it comes to Vegas, let's just say it really does PAY to look like an old gramma w/ your players card (bungee cord included so you don't forget it!) plugged into the slot machines while you gamble away.\n\nThis wasn't the BEST place I've ever stayed in Vegas, but definitely an option for when I return."
2,"this place is awesome! Had a great time! We went here labor day weekend and it very tasty but EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!!!!! But it's sushi, it's in Vegas, and the setting is fancy so it was expected! We ordered a lot of sashimi, sake, and beer. It was just 4 of us and managed to rack up a bill of almost $500.00 but did not regret it at all it was worth it! One of the best in VEGAS from the several I have tried in Vegas."
4,"I'm Thai and when it comes to looking for authentic Thai cuisines, Pin Kaow is always the first thought that comes to mind! I love their entrees; there's many selections to choose from! I usually order panang, larb, pad see ew, pad thai, and Tom Yum majority of the time and they've always been scrumptious and splendid! I've never really ever had a bad experience with my visits here nor the South Rainbow one. So far, this place is a five-star and I highly recommend it. Food's delicious, service was consistent, wait was fair, atmosphere's welcoming and mellow, and prices are good!\n\n(This is a copy/paste of the same review I left for the S. Rainbow Pin Kaow. Just thought I might as well leave a great review for the North as well since my experiences with both were fantastic!) Hope others can agree!"
2,"Pad Thai is good as everyone else has said. Roti is not good. Taste like raw dough; sauce is alright though. Coconut rice is not good. There's really no coconut flavor, and the rice is hard. It took awhile for us to get our waiter, but the food came pretty fast. I recommend the pad thai. Haven't tried other dishes. I give this a 3 just because of the pad thai. If you want good Malaysian food, Penang is still my top choice."
2,"First time here. Prices were reasonable and the line was long. The eggs and toast were good, about average but the French toast I did not care for it had too much cinnamon and just didn't taste as well as I had expected. My daughter would not eat it as it was too flavorful for a child's palate. Overall pretty good ."
0,"Home Town Buffet Anyone? The food here tastes like HTB! Their sushi is pathetic. Oh yeah... I'm gonna put seaweed with rice and fake crab and pass it off as a sushi roll.... \n\nThanks, but no thanks!"
0,"We're die hard Fatburger fans and stop in every time we're in Las Vegas.  Tonight we stopped in and found that the place has been completely renovated - no issue with that, it looks a lot better.  \nThe only thing that was not better was the food!  The decline in quality was not what we expected but neither was the sharp increase in prices!  $30 bucks for 2 burgers and fries is too much to pay for a strip mall burgers.  \nWe won't be back anytime soon."
2,"Originally I was going to give this place two stars, so consider this a 2.5 I guess. I was out showing some new friends around Las Vegas and taking them to the more out of the way places tourist typically do not see. I thought Ellis Island would be the kicker for the night, because all four of the boys (Marines, btw) really wanted to do karaoke.\n\nWe arrived there a little after 11 PM and went to the karaoke bar and the place was pretty crowded. It looked like your Ellis Island crowd. I have been to Ellis Island before, just not to the karaoke part. Well we all got in no problem and grabbed some beers at the bar. Okay, they have incredibly cheap drinks. $1.75 for a beer. Crazy cheap. We all ordered a round of their in house light beer. Yes, they do brew their own beer, pretty cool. The boys went and selected their songs and my friend (who is a local) and I hung out to stalk a table.\n\nEventually a group left and we got a pretty sweet table in the back with a good view of the stage. Everything was going pretty cool - except for the fact the place was stifling hot! I don't know if they're trying to save money by not cranking up the AC, but when there are that many people in an old bar, you better get some AC running!! It did cool down, but being in a hot bar is just gross.\n\nAs we waited for the boys' names to be called we had another round and this time tried the Hefeweizen beer. Whoa. It tasted like orange juice, just straight up OJ with a splash of beer. I didn't really like it, neither did anyone else.\n\nFinally the boys names came up and they went to sing. The first one went and then we waited. And then the next boy got called. Well, they were planning on singing a duet song (Brooks & Dunn I think) and the lady running the karaoke wouldn't let them! She said they couldn't because the first guy had just gone up to sing. It was a shame. Plus right after that they let another girl go up who had just been up on the stage about 20 minutes earlier. Just seemed eff'd up to me and we were all kind of pissed about it.\n\nSo, we left on a sour note. We didn't feel like waiting around through another 10 singers just for the boys to get another chance to sing.\n\nIt was pretty obvious they were letting people who are regulars there go up on the stage multiple times, but first timers not so much. I get it, it's a local place and a local event and that's who they're catering to - but they made ME feel bad because my friends got skunked out of doing karaoke! \n\nThis night just left a bad taste in my mouth (with the bad Hefenweizen and the situation)."
1,"I love the fact that Walmart is always open; however, the convenience is not worth it if I have to experience the environment at this Walmart. My wife and I visited this location around 9 p.m. on a weeknight  in order to pick up a couple DVDs we've been wanting to watch. \n\nThe first issue we had was the construction in the parking lot blocking a big section of the parking. It wasn't a huge deal, but it did darken a big portion of the lot, causing the area to feel a little unsafe. It's by no means a deal-breaker, but it is nice for businesses to have more secure, welcoming environments. \n\nWhen we walked into the store, we could tell right away that it was not going to be easy to find the movies we wanted. Before we even made it past the cash registers, we could see random products abandoned on random shelves in the wrong areas or even on the floor. The first impression given by the store is disarray or chaos. \n\nThe electronics department was even worse. There was almost no organization to it, except for a few signs that were mislabeling the movie genres. We couldn't tell if our comedy movies were sold in the store, or really if any comedy movies were sold since there wasn't a sign , so we asked one of the employees in the electronics department. Without looking at the inventory database, she said they probably don't have the movies. I asked her where I could find the comedy films, and she pointed me to a section that happened to be for TV shows and children's movies. We never found the comedy section.\n\nHonestly, with a little organization and tidiness, this store could have earned another two stars. I just hope it was an off night for the store and not the norm."
3,"There are donut people and then there are cupcake people. Some may argue that they fall in between the two and like both, but these individuals are most certainly lying to themselves. \n\nI am 100% a donut person, BUT that is not to say I don't like cupcakes. I would preferrr donuts, but I'll consume sugar in all forms, yep - even cupcake form. \nDaisy Caf\u00e9 and Cupcakery (as the name implies) is a cupcake person. She lives and sleeps and dreams all things cupcake, and it shows because she sure knows how to make em. \n\nDaisy cooks up a mean cinnamon cream cheese and carrot walnut cupcake with citrus notes that, in the words of Guy Fieri, makes this cupcake outta bounds.\n\nI've also experienced the cream cheese red velvet and the chocolate peanut butter banana pecan, and while everything was mighty tasty, the true star of the show was the pecan pie cupcake that I was able to try. I follow Daisy on Facebook and they'll periodically post some of the rotating cupcake flavors and this pecan pie one made the page, and seeing as I am absolutely obsessed with pecan pie I knew I had to get my hands on this guy. And I did. And it.was.GOOD.\n\nCupcake/donut nonsense aside, Daisy also masters the art of good breakfast food. \n\nWhen I ate in here I stuck with the traditional \""Pick 3\"" of 2 sunny up eggs, bacon, and a pancake. It did not disappoint. \n\nWe also ordered the Chorizo and Avocado Omelet with housemade pico de gallo, oven roasted potatoes, and fresh fruit. Super yum. Great portions and so quality and fresh.\n\nDaisy is a great find in terms of breakfast spots and delicious cupcakes. Highly recommend."
1,Slow service. I've come multiple times to the drive through and end up waiting more than five minutes for service.
2,"Really good strips but no seasoning.  Fries are awful--think Oreida. Texas toast as a side is very soft and mushy.  Coleslaw is good.  Only choice of dip is their cane sauce which is mayo and ketchup.  Don't understand why there's no other vegetable choices, mac and cheese or something like applesauce.  Also, no hot sauce or buffalo sauce?!  Oh the lemonade is great though.  We mainly get the tailgate and lemonade and take it home so we can eat it with Frank's Hot Sauce..Yum."
4,I recently bought my second car here. This has to be the best darn car dealership ever. The Finance guy was the coolest guy I have ever met. the sales staff was great.
4,"I met bunch of cute Irish guys here, as in, actually from Ireland with cute accents.  5 stars for that alone!  Kidding aside, I'm a sucker for a good pub.  Every time I've come here, it's been a blast.\n\nUpdate:  Last night I needed a cab.  I am all stressed about this because my mobile is dead.  No worries.  They have a button that you push to get a cab, that's right, a BUTTON.  I swear it's true."
1,"We will NEVER be back. I'm only giving it two stars cause our server was wonderful, but without good food, the service doesn't mean too much.\n\nMy man ordered the chicken crepe. Sounds good in theory, until it came out, and it looked like a soupy mess! So much flavorless liquid, it was totally disgusting. Whatever liquid (think like chicken pot pie soup, but without any flavor) made the crepe slimy and gooey, and not appetizing. \n\nI ordered corned beef hash, and it was too salty, tasted un-cooked and really chewy. It resembled dog food/asphalt. \n\nBoth of our came with their \""famous\"" potato pancakes, and I think they should be \""famous\"" for being horrible. No flavor, and VERY greasy!! Needed salt, or ketchup to make them edible. It came with a little cup of apple sauce, which happened to be the most flavorful item we received. Too bad it was supposed to be a condiment. \n\nSeriously, we have NEVER had such a horrible breakfast in Las Vegas. Please save yourself some money and go somewhere else!!"
2,"I went with a group of four for the hibachi.  It's just like Benihana.  I find the food expensive, but the it was entertaining watching food fly outside my kitchen.  I had the NY steak.  Personally, I prefer to have my steak in one piece."
3,"I recently came here at 3 a.m. with a group of friends after we were done clubbing at Hyde. ROOKIE MISTAKE. Oh man, I feel so dumb. I have been a fan of Secret Pizza since day one, and this was the first time I went at such an insane hour. Egad. I don't recommend this AT ALL. Sure, we were the fools that walked from one damn casino to another, which in all honesty is also a dumb mistake. But the pizza here is so, so good! Nice, thin and crisp!\n\nAfter the long trek from the Bellgio to the Cosmopolitan, we saw the crowd but got in line nonetheless. After waiting for more than 20 minutes we decided that in order to make the most of it we should order a whole pie. Well some other people had the same idea and they had been waiting for 45 minutes. What? We ended up getting one slice per person, which is really sad (and kind of expensive). This was a week ago and I am still craving pizza. \n\nThe lesson? Go before midnight. You'll thank me for it."
4,"i went here to get my tooth extracted, and i was scared and frightened like crazy. This dentist has to be the best dentist i've ever experienced. i didnt feel any pain and he made me feel at ease, before i knew it the tooth was out. I will definetly refer him my family members."
2,"It appeared very obvious that Red Velvet Cafe would win me over, upon the moment we arrived- due to their lovely decor, likely furnished by IKEA. The modern bar stools & high tops were aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, not very practical when dining in such a confined area. I couldn't really get comfortable while eating, which was a turn off, at first.\n\nTo start out, we ordered \""Chicken/ Vegan Nuggets\"". When I read this on the menu, I thought \""Oh cool, you have an option to get either chicken or vegan style\"". Apparently, I was very wrong. Our vegan nuggets were average, definitely not chicken, but not horrific either. I really enjoyed the tangy red sauce that they were served beside. I'm still kicking myself for not asking what it was- I wanna go with...something vinegar based?!\n\nFor our main course, my boyfriend & I shared the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. I wasn't really sold on this when we ordered it. Not because I'm shy about spicy things, but because its described as \"" Lettuce, Tomato, Buffalo Sauce, Ranch and Cheese\"" (I mean really, how exciting can you be, Buffalo Chicken Wrap?). Despite its very bland description, there are so many complements it deserves! First of all, you know when you're eating a wrap & its hard to take bites without pieces of lettuce, meat, or other veggies escaping because they are too long? How about chopped lettuce (no yucky iceberg pieces) mixed with cheese, lightly covered in ranch & cubed grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce- all cozy in a wheat wrap. Very easy to eat, without excess food particles falling out! I also loved the fact that it was served with baked chips. I give this wrap 4 stars!\n\nLets get down to my favorite part of every meal...DESSERT! So, you can't go to the Red Velvet Cafe without ordering Red Velvet Cake. No regrets there, at all. Although I was very shocked when I found out that the entire piece of cake that I consumed was only 150 calories (not that I'm couting) AND completely vegan!!! It tasted like a heart attack, although its significantly less volatile than that Little Debbie Snack Trash your mom put in your lunch box. Without a doubt, the best red velvet that I've ever experienced. The frosting was heavenly, the cake was rich, & the strawberry on top- refreshing.\n\nWill I return to Red Velvet Cafe? YES, can't wait!"
2,A great place for UFC fights and above average bar wings.  But dont show up early for the gifht if its a Tennessee game day.  Those fans are not too appreciative of anyone not wearing orange and dont understand that nobody cares to watch their team when decent sports are on other stations.
0,My first time using yelp and this delivery service was horrible. It took an hour and 30 for it come after quoting us 45 minutes. The pizza came and it was like warm at best. The driver didn't have my pizza in a warmer when I got it. The pizza itself is hard to judge because I didn't get it hot but the sauce tasted decent. Wouldn't use this place again just because of the fact they didn't deliver a hot pizza
1,"La Creperie only reinforces why I never try crepes at touristy attractions. Although they have both dessert crepes and savory ones, I always try the dessert. We ordered the Favorite, which was filled with raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries topped with raspberry coulis (another fancy name for raspberry sauce). The crepe was a little soggy and too thick for my liking. The raspberry sauce was too tangy I had to counteract it with whipped cream. I've had good raspberry sauce and a little tang is good, but this was too much. But maybe you'll have a better experience with a different crepe and maybe I would have given you a better review La Creperie if you had a better raspberry sauce and I didn't have to wait 40 minutes to be disappointed."
4,Amazing food!! Amazing atmosphere!!! Amazing service!! This place is amazing..that's nothing more to say!!!!
0,Predicting this place won't be around long. Boring as hell. No music. Waiters don't talk. They have no emotion nor personality. Very poor quality and small portion for the price. Rip off. Don't eat here. Not worth trying even with a coupon.
3,"I always love visiting The Palazzo!  The rooms are not only gorgeous, but spacious and luxurious.  The velvet couches are awesome!  It's a great place to stay in a fantastic location and my husband and I always enjoy ourselves.  We look forward to many more stays here!"
4,This was my first visit here and it was beyond great. The new owner gave me a local discount which was very nice of him. My items were done about 4hrs earlier then expected. They smelled good and were all folded and wrapped up very nicely. I will defiantly be coming here again.
4,"First I have to say the Cosmo hotel is AMAZING! didn't know where to grab a bite to eat and saw Holsteins....atmosphere was great, loved the graffiti vibe/pics on the wall/menu covers/etc. Service was great...my boyfriend got the standard burger with the ste\u00e5k fries...yum and I got the mini burgers. They were the perfect size! Every restaurant should have mini burgers for the ladies who want a burger but just can't eat the whole thing....\nAfter I tried the steak fries I had to order a side for myself....everything was awesome...their drink list was never ending...the amount of beers they have is great! we had to shock tops (not too many places carry that and it's my favorite)....\nWe'd definitely go back...almost did for the second time on that trip! :)"
4,"I've been to this Italian place twice so far - and both times I was highly impressed with the quality of food and very helpful service.  Our waitress recommended a fantastic wine, priced until $40.  I had the stuffed shrimp mushrooms - which were out of this world.  As you see from the other reviews, the bread and pesto are delicious, and it's hard to not spoil your appetite with them! There were 4 large stuffed (spinach, crab) mushrooms with a huge shrimp on top.  For the main course I had the Osso Bucco - which is braised pork (cooked 6 hours) and a side of homemade gnocchi.  The pork was incredibly tender.  I can't wait to go back!!"
1,"Group party dinner the night before the 2011 Rock and Roll Arizona Marathon. The restaurant was busy that night, but isn't it always before a marathon? The entrees were pricey, but I guess that's normal for authentic Italian dishes. Good times, great company. \n\nI had the veal lasanga, side salad, with 2 bottles of Heinekin. Wasn't the best, since the portions were smaller, service could've been better, and the prices were just a bit too much."
2,"This is a pretty \""decent\"" yogurt place, but it still doesn't compare to other froyo shops like Zoyo and Menchies.\n\nI really wanted to like this place more, especially since it is SO close to where I live. I definitely agree with the other reviewers about the stupid sample cup rule. Half of the fun is trying different flavors! EVERY time I have been there, there has been ONE sample cup sitting on a napkin, which means you have to pick your brain to decide which flavor (out of about 14) you want to try. They will not give you another cup to try more. Last time I was there, I took the one lonely little cup to try a flavor and watched as the person working there replaced it with another one tiny cup. Are they that painfully cheap?I just don't get why you wouldn't let a paying customer sample about a tablespoon of more than one flavor.\n\nTheir yogurt flavors are pretty good though, so that's a plus! :)\n\nThey do have a lot of toppings, but not as much of a fruit selection as the other shops do. I had strawberries, blueberries and maraschino cherries to choose from. Where are the blackberries/raspberries/kiwis other shops have? Wahhh! They do have a lot of cookie dough/brownie crumbles and chocolatey treats to decide from... If that's your type of thing.\n\nI'll probably still go here every now and then if I'm too lazy to drive the extra 2 miles to Zoyo, but I won't like it as much. LOL"
1,"My food came out ice cold. I don't mean warm, I mean cold! Other order at table was fine."
2,"I'm going to have to agree with some previous reviews that the best time to go is during happy hour. The tapas available were pretty good and the price was excellent. By the time we left, we were full and the bill wasn't bad.  However, the service was definitely lacking. Our server was a little rude and seemed to only be friendly with other people that showed up and appeared to be regulars. One good thing was that the place wasn't busy when we showed up and the food came out quick."
3,I randomly ended up here the other night with a friend to get our sushi fix (you sushi junkies know how serious those withdrawals are).  I ordered the Sunkissed Roll and it was pretty good.  I really like that the Edamame is free with your food instead of being $2 or some other measly charge that's more of an annoyance than anything just because you have to physically order it.  So that was a plus.  Service was very good also.  Our waitress was constantly checking with us to make sure our water was filled and see if we needed anything else.
0,"The worst brisket I have ever encountered. Sometimes, the run down shack atmosphere with the dirt parking lot places are where the best food is found, but in this case the crappy outside matches the lousy food inside this terrordome. The entire brisket sandwich combo platter was a complete mess. I heard bells ringing in the back of this place which indicated my brisket was being nuked and then placed on the sesame bun from the grocery store. There was so much fat on this brisket that nothing was edible at all. I mean, fat ripped through every lousy strip of the gross meat that they claim was smoked on premises. There was some very yellow potato salad that was served as my side dish and it tasted very relishy, but not homemade as the the one employee said. A place just can't really operate with one employee either. It's time to raize this shack and let someone build something pretty and nice in this rundown neighborhood. worst brisket ever."
4,"Great pizza and salads! Check it out for a new, clean place on Fremont."
2,"This is a pretty okay place to go for drinks or meeting friends after work.  The menu is overly large, too many entrees and not very imaginative.  Conveniently located both downtown and at Hilldale.  Nothing special.  Tends to be kind of noisy."
3,A very unique experience... and a great selection of beer... Ive never had a bad time there ... No food kind of stinks but they have limited space and there are other options around... a great place to start or end the night... and catch some live music
4,Suzi's readings are always interesting and accurate!  She always surprises me with her ability to predict things in my life.  Very much enjoy her readings!
0,"I wish I could vote NO STARS, because I would, if I could.\n\nThe guy who owns the franchise in Las Vegas (Kurtis Johnson) USED to be a fantastic guy, and his employees were the absolute BEST at what they did.  He even went so far as to provide me with a LOANER, totally FREE, while his staff was repairing my car, which was spectacular of him.\n\nBut somewhere along the line, he (or his workers, I'm not sure) became, for want of a better term, \""back-stabbers.\""  Good people were outright fired (or not \""talked out\"" of quitting) and the whole operation quickly slid downhill.\n\nThe location I used to regularly patronize (1765 E Charleston Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89104-1943) is now closed up, either an innocent victim of a lousy economy, or because Mr. Johnson's questionable method(s) of dealing with regular customers have come back to haunt him.\n\nWhat's really sad about this local franchise, is that they enjoyed an \""A+\"" rating from (and were an Accredited Business of) the Clark County Better Business Bureau.  That \""A+\"" rating was not given lightly; it had to be honestly EARNED by the company.\n\nI have no idea what went wrong with them, but I'll never go back to find out, and you shouldn't visit them, either, unless you ENJOY rude and unprofessional treatment."
4,"Dr. Donnie McAdams is by far the best dentist I have ever been to and his wife Jaime, who is the dental hygienist, is awesome.  They really have something special going on at there office.  Dr. McAdams does amazing work and he is completely honest as well.  I was in Scottsdale for a trip and started having tooth pain that couldn't wait untill I returned home.  I went to their office and they took care of everything.  He didn't try to scam me into anything that I didn't need.  He was completely honest with me and both Dr. McAdams and Jaime just made me feel great.  If I could afford it, I would fly here every time I needed a cleaning or a check up."
1,"As a guest at the MGM Signature, we got into this club for free, so we decided to give it a try (Saturday May 14).  I was not impressed overall and do not plan to return.\n\nFirst the good:\n1. The space was nice - the dance floor was big and open and there was a balcony / upstairs area, which was nice if you wanted to get a little space from the other patrons.\n\n2. When the sketchy drunk guy tried to steal my friend's jacket and camera, the bouncers got the situation under control quickly and efficiently.  \n\nThen the bad:\n1.  See #2 above - sketchy drunk guy tried to steal my friend's camera and jacket....  He was clearly drunk and acting very odd.  I am somewhat surprised that he was not removed from the club before the incident with my friend.\n\n2.  No Effen Vodka.  =(\n\n3.  The club did not have a \""Vegas\"" feel .  People seemed a lot more dressed down than they did at lot of the other clubs we visited.  It reminded me more of a club you'd see back in the midwest.  \n\nAgain, I do have to give props to the bouncers who helped us out, and I would give them 4 stars for service, but just ranking the club itself for dancing and having a night out in Vegas, I have to give it 2 stars."
3,Good food and good service.\n\nIf you're planning to eat at this location on a Friday or Saturday I would recommend making reservations to avoid the long wait.
0,"I have never reviewed the LACK of service from a Mac store in my life...and to be a pro store just makes it worse. They seemed to be so fun and sweet when I had my \""business attire\"" on a couple weeks ago, but have me just come from the gym and all of a sudden I get completely different treatment. Not only was the greeting less than genuine but the \""person in charge\""  did nothing to even make me believe she understood my frustration regarding a product. But only stated \""well I use it too and it's never happened to me\""...well hey there, it happened to me!!! \nNot coming back here unless ready for the stuffy, stuck up staff and wanna be manager...."
3,Madison's most quaint and romantic little italian bistro (there aren't that many of them).  Their wine cellar has a very extensive beer and wine list.
2,This restaurant should be called BLT Milkshake because the milkshakes were some of the best I've tried.  The burger on the other hand was below par for the price.  It was a bit dried because the patty was overcooked.  The milkshake is the star and definitely worth the fly by.
3,"I eat here regularly and their spring rolls are the best in town! They are so good and fresh! Also the spicy lemongrass Beef and Pork dish are very good (88 or 89?). Pho is pretty good, but their are better places in town for that. Overall the prices are good, food is consistantly good, and the restaurant has a nice relaxed atmosphere."
1,Too slow. Dish tastes so so.
1,After reading the reviews on yelp I was expecting more from this place. They didn't seem to have anything scary more just gross and people getting in your face. \n\nThe make up was good and I liked the bodies hanging from the roof room but the scariest moments were when the guy walking around the outside would drop his shovel on the ground and drag it.\n\nPrice wasn't bad but considering I paid for VIP and still spent more time in line than the actual house when it wasn't that busy is pretty bad.
2,"It's hard to sum up my feelings about this place. \""Meh\"" seems to be the closest description. In fact, that was the exact response when I asked my boyfriend how his french onion soup was. \n\nLet's start at the beginning. The Mill opened a few months ago in that big brick building where the old Fishbone Grill used to be. When you walk in you can see that they didn't do much remodeling, but they didn't need to. The exposed wood rafters, stained concrete floor, and low brick dividing walls leftover from Fishbone fit perfectly into the mill house/country vintage chic vibe they were going for. The atmosphere was nice, subtle, and infused with some softer classic rock. The atmosphere isn't as important as the food, and unfortunately in this case the food did not quite compare.\n\nWe had crab dip, french onion soup, and fettuccine alfredo, which we got in that order and in a timely fashion. The crab dip was good, with a nice layer of melty pepper jack cheese that lent just the right amount of spice to an otherwise average dip. The aforementioned \""meh\"" french onion soup came alongside my salad, a mixture of greens (no brown iceburg here) with a disappointing honey mustard dressing. The soup itself was \""fine, but like they pulled it off before it was done cooking\"", lacking the deep, stewed-for-days flavor that makes a fantastic french onion soup. The alfredo was fine. Thick, creamy, a little too much pepper an not enough garlic, but a generous portion for nine dollars. We split it and still ended up taking half home.\n\nWould I recommend The Mill? Sure. There's something for everyone, and the service, atmosphere, and beer, can probably make up for the mediocre food."
3,"Love the place, but the wait is unbelievably long !   The pizza is superb, truly the best pizza i have had in a very long time.  Best to go make an appointment and come back a few hours later for your table."
1,"The good-our waitress was great and the fries and hushpuppies were awesome!\nThe okay-tea was sweet and the food got there fast\nThe bad-silverskin not taken off the ribs, pork chop was way overdone and dry\nThe awful-baked beans had a weird aftertaste, kinda like garlic powder maybe; and the cole slaw was the consistency of mashed potatoes.\nI ordered the combo of ribs and pork chop. My wife got the pulled pork small sandwich. First thing I noticed when I got the ribs was the silverskin. It is tough and should always be removed. I asked the waitress about this and she had no idea but said that was the way they cook the ribs. I pulled it off and the rest was just okay. My wife did like the fact that they had Frank's Red Hot sauce and bbq sauce at the table and says her sandwich was okay as well.\nEven though this place is on the way home from work I do not think we will be going back."
1,"I tried on a lot of dresses here but first -- we waited about 10-15 minutes for a room and a consultant. We were on time for our appointment so I am not sure why this happened. Then, our consultant put 6 of us total, in a room where another group was, AND then shared! So, my consultant was helping another bride and myself. Well - I did a lot of waiting :(\n\nAlso - she just had us walk around and pick out dresses. She wrote NONE of them down and I pointed out 20 dresses easy. Some of them she forgot about (weird I know) and we had to remind her. She pulled the dresses over my head - which I guess is ok but by the end of the day my skin was just wrecked. \n\nSomeone else helped a few times and she was awesome - she knew her stuff! Not sure why I had to share really but it was very frustrating."
4,Forget about other sub shops - Jersey Mike's is the BEST! They cut the meat and cheese fresh when you order your sub - everything is fresh and delicious every single time I go to Jersey Mike's! I read other reviews about it being expensive - here's the deal - you get what you pay for. Jersey Mike's has quality food and excellent service - well worth paying a little extra for! Tip: Get your sub and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours - the flavors melt together and become even more amazing :)
0,"Loud, expensive, obnoxious, highly visible to the strip... SO unimpressed... Expensive cover...\n\nOnly reason I came in here, is because I had met one of the bartenders... She promised to hook me up... Otherwise, for as many times as I had been to Vegas, I would never have thought to come here... Just never really seemed like my scene...\n\nFrustrated by having the leave the club in order to use a restroom.  This place was just a bad experience minus the fact that my buddy and I got shit housed for (practically) free."
3,"I used to go to the old mexican place that was in this location... I'm really pleased with the changes they made! My mini-tostadas were great, and my friend's tacos were delish, too! We sat at the bar, and had wonderful service. The waiter was prompt, friendly, and funny. He filled us in on the varying portion sizes, and recommended great dishes. \n\nGreat selection of tequila at the bar, but we were happy to get Bohemias. ;)\n\nIts a really convenient location (atrium level in the Luxor), and reasonable prices for Vegas. \n\nGive it a go!"
0,"The pizza was absolutely delicious as expected and the mozzarella was dreamy !\nHowever, the treatment we received horrible !  \nWe had never been before , so my husband and I ordered a pizza to share,  since we are not big eaters. It was clearly not enough. So get this....we tried to order another pizza and were told \""no, there are too many people waiting\"". We were given are check and the table was cleared!  \n\nI don't care how good your pizza is!!! You can lump it for such rude behavior!! I would rather get a Dominoe's Death Disk before I would return."
3,This place rocks! Delicious food for a great price and a nice atmosphere. Good for date night or a stop while you're bar hoping. Two thumbs up.
0,"Nine times out of ten, this store is great. I just went through the line with a checker named Lida. She could not have been more rude. She never even said hi. She was chatting with the nagger and another checker. This was after she was finished chatting with another checker, making people wait in line. Lida is not a checker that I am familiar with but I would rather wait in a long line than go through hers again."
3,"Nice gym not too busy even at rush hour. There are not enough water fountains in this gym. They don't even have a fountain in the locker rooms. Need more free weights. Over all I like this gym alot, its quick in and out love the covered parking at Gilbert."
1,"Far, far away from me is Floyd Lamb park. \n\nAfter drinking a smoothie and a 45 minute drive, I needed a bathroom. We pulled up, paid the $6 fee. The gal working there was sweet, friendly, and bubbly. She complemented my jewelry, called my guy a keeper and told us to have fun.\n\nNow, the bathroom situation.......\n\nWe met up with another group of friends, and one of our gals had to use the bathroom also. Unfortunately, many of the toilets were unusable. Besides some of the lights not working (I guess I could have pee'd in the dark)..... The toilets were almost OVER flowing with waste. \n\nWe did find a usable toilet, with barely enough toilet paper to use for one individual. I'm guessing this is because most of it was scattered on the floor. \n\nThere is also no soap dispenser, and the automatic hand dryer wasn't working. Barely dried cookies, wet hands..... I mean, not the way I want to start a day with my family.\n\nWe found a spot to fish, but the park is poorly maintained. Trash is scattered, and I know it comes along with it, but the bird droppings were out of control. The walk way was covered with them.\n\nFor a $6 entry fee, this park should be better maintained. I'm pretty disappointed. The scenery is lovely, but with the amount of fecal matter (human and animal) it is not a place that I would be dying to go back to."
2,"Mostly good food, bad service, fair prices.\n\nWe went here because we weren't a fan of the Palms buffet and already had our expensive (but fantastic) meal at Nove. I ordered a grilled patty melt which was a burger with onions and cheddar on rye bread  with russian dressing with a side of cole slaw.\n\nBurger was good. On par with the diner patty melt I get back in Long Island which is great. Cole slaw was pretty disgusting though.  It tasted like garbage (I hope they didn't actually get it from the garbage).  \n\nService was very slow. We waited 20 minutes for our food. Also, I got GRILLED by the waitress because she thought I wasn't going to leave a tip. You have to pay at the register after your meal so that's what I did and was going to leave a tip after I got changed. She stared me down until she realized I was going back to the table to leave her a tip."
3,"Animal Elegance is not much on the outside but the owner was very nice & LISTENED to how I wanted my teacup poodle groomed and used the products that I requested.\nI was very happy with my services and I will return. \n My poodles groom was $50,including tip, which I think is very reasonable."
3,"The popcorn shrimp was good. The pulled pork sandwich lacked sauce. It is beyond me why they don't add sauce to the sandwich. We were all fans of the fried bbq chicken.  It is soft, moist, and has a vinegar taste.  We got a breast and a wing without having to pay an up charge. This is most likely the only item that we will order next time.  The french fries were really good, but the cheap Hunt's ketchup was not an asset.  The fries are good and definitely worth gracing with Heinz ketchup. the hush puppies were nothing to write home about. I like something added to my hush puppy like onion. The onion rings were of the flour variety with the fried casing kept falling off.  I prefer the crunchy cornmeal type. They are closed Sunday and Monday, so we had to wait for them to open Tuesday.  The iced tea was delicious and it was already sweetened! The cole slaw was delicious, just like grandma used to make.  The potato salad was meh. The roll was meh.  Thank goodness were were traveling with cash because they don't accept credit cards. We will go back and after reading other reviews i am curious to try the cherry lemon sundrop."
4,I went here today and I loved it. They have a lot of cute unique boutique shops that you don't find anywhere else around town. I take it back they have a brio and a kabuki but those places are delicious.\n\nI love how they have covered parking! They have a parking garage and that is perfect for Vegas. I really have to consider how hot it is and covered parking will bring me back.\n\nAll the shops we stopped by have such sweet staff so it was a pleasure spending a couple hours here.\n\nLastly they have a little kids park! It is cute and clean with unique play things.\n\nI love everything about the place. They even black off the streets so you don't have to watch out for cars.
3,"I've been to two other Bikram studios in the valley (which all offer first-timer discounts), but Avondale is closest to my house.  Overall, I've probably taken around fifteen classes at this studio.  \n\nI'm a huge fan of yoga in general and I love Bikram.  I am not a regular unfortunately because I work full-time, go to grad school, and the Avondale schedule doesn't work for me Mondays, Wednesdays, or Fridays.  (They offer late classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8:15 p.m. start time.)  \n\nThe pricing is very similar at all of the studios in Phoenix and it can be very pricey when compared to a gym membership.  Currently I pay the drop-in rate of $17 for each class.  You can pay to rent a mat if you don't have one and they sell beverages as well as yoga gear.  (I've never purchased anything except coconut water.)  \n\nThe instructors are awesome; very positive and motivating even when you are overwhelmed, sitting down and resting.  I've been to other studios where they resemble drill sergeants and I can feel my blood pressure elevating, which is not what I'm looking for in a yoga instructor.  My fave instructor is Nikki, whose sense of humor easily comes through and lightens up the class.  One instructor I was not such a fan of, but I believe she has left.  They are always available after class for questions and are constantly praising students for effort, posture, etc.  \n\nThis studio is relaxing, professional, and has a positive atmosphere.  I've met one of the owners and she was radiating with kindess and genuine positivity.  A suggestion: help correct people's postures more whether it be during class or after.  It's amazing how one subtle adjustment in yoga can make all the difference."
3,"Joe's is awesome! The service is actually very disorganized and awkward at best. After dealing with the confusing and long lines, however, you'll forget about it when you get your amazing dessert! I got the Mango Tango Joe's Latti (which is the Italian ice mixed with soft serve) and my husband got the Black Lemonade Italian Ice. We were both very happy! The ice stays soft and frozen for a long time so you don't feel like you have to eat it super fast. Also, some people were there JUST for the soft serve! Just go now."
3,"I love coming here during lunch and getting their crawfish etouffee. It has so many spices, so much crawfish. The portion is generous enough to keep you satisfied. The only issue is the price. Everything seems pretty expensive (even for seafood)."
4,"Delicious food at a reasonable value, super friendly and professional wait staff, very clean, and nice atmosphere without being pretentious.  The \""Classic Dinner\"" options state that they come with Caesar salad, mixed vegetables, and baked potato, but they are very accommodating and you can easily substitute another salad and/or potato choice.\n\nThe wedge salad is great, assuming you enjoy bleu cheese... the bacon-wrapped filet, well, what can I say - when you wrap one kind of meat with another kind of meat, you can't go wrong!  Even the standard baked potato was delish.  For dessert, they have these great shot glass desserts that would give you just a taste of something sweet, but of course I had to go all out and get a full-sized dessert.  The name of the dessert I got was something like \""Billy Miner Pie.\""  Mocha ice cream on an oreo pie crust sprinkled with toasted almonds - divine!\n\nTry this place... it's good stuff!"
1,Food took forever and arrived cold.  Hollandaise was gellatinous and tasteless.  Sawyer is rude.  Valerie is awesome.   Very pricey for such average food.  Very disappointed
4,"Had a wonderful dining experience at Dick's several months ago, and plan to return today :)  I love this restaurant, so cozy, such great service, such outstanding food...yep, this restaurant IS as good as it gets!!!  Thank you!!!"
4,"Great food, great company@ a great price."
0,"Wow, don't eat here. It's terrible."
2,"The wife and I have a ritual that whenever I have a day off of my regular work schedule we wake up and head straight to DD. This location is relatively small, pretty clean, and the workers are pretty quick with the coffee.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the low selection of munchkins they have. Last time we went they only had chocolate glazed, glazed, and strawberry jam. One of my favorite childhood memories of busting open a box of munchkins was the variety. This location robs me of that :( A corporate decision? A franchiser decision? Regional differences? Who knows. Maybe I'm spoiled coming from MA, the home state of DD, but come on!!!\n\nThe layout could be better. As you stand in line you can't see all the donuts in the display case because they decided to have the counter and the display case right in the middle so as you walk in the coffee machines block your view until you get right up to the counter :(\n\nI suppose I'll have to check out the location on South Easton one of these days."
4,Fantastic dining experience that is well worth the price. Great service with delicious items and nice atmosphere. One of my favorites in Sin City!
4,Excellent Pizza and appetizers.  It is a dive.
4,This was the best naan and Gyro I've ever had. The staff was friendly and so hard working. I will go back to try the lamb kebabs.
1,"Food was OK, but the reason for the low rating was the service. My waiter was obviously overworked. It took 15 minutes for him to even come over to greet me, then another 10 just to get a salad. He never came over during the meal to check on me, then dropped off the check. I filled out one of those online surveys and put my contact info, but here i am two weeks later and no one has contacted me."
2,"I went to this place due to some elite yelpers giving it very high marks.  Here is my take:  \nThe food: 4 Stars.  Very Authentic Mexican Cuisine. So before you go there realize you are not going to get a taco with cheese in it.  The portions are not going to be overflowing your plate.  There isn't going to be a hundred different combo's to choose from.  The Menu is one piece of paper.  That said, I really enjoyed the salsa bar and the authenticity of the food.  \nThe Service:  2.5 Stars.  Perhaps a drawback that comes with the authenticity.  When I went there the people who worked there knew very little English.  Thus, they didn't get my order right.  Also, when I went they only had one server.  So when they had 5 Tables it was difficult to get more chips and refills on soda.  \nOverall, I was happy.  I got a good meal for a very cheap price."
1,"Ok not sure if I would make another trip had better in town,really kind of disappointing"
4,"Moving is always such a pain in the butt--dealing with all the packing/renting a truck/getting all of your stuff from point A to point B--I hate it.  It's nice when someone like Nick Lackner at City Center Storage is not only friendly to a fault, but extremely helpful and willing to do a little extra just to make your life a little bit easier.  \n\nI rented a Uhaul and my pickup location was inexplicably changed (by corporate Uhaul) from a location 0.25 miles from my house, to this place that was about 7 miles away.  After some public transit challenges, I found my way to City Center Storage and was happily greeted by Nick, who apologized profusely for Uhaul's mistake--not necessary, but definitely appreciated.  \n\nHe got me in a nice clean truck quickly and sent me on my way.  So grateful!"
3,"Butcher and the Rye is the second restaurant from the guys behind Meat & Potatoes. And it is just as beautiful as its sister location inside. The man behind the design is none other then the chef himself, Rick DeShantz. Rick and team paid close attention to every detail in the space and clearly understood that part of the battle of a great dining experience comes from the atmosphere.\n\nI only explored the downstairs area as it was pretty jam-packed full of people. But the downstairs is sexy. It feels straight out of a Kinfolk magazine spread. Butcher paper on rollers with hand written specials hang from the wall. A wall full of spirits glow from backlighting. And a chandelier made from what looks to be barrel hoops is anchored to the far side of the bar. I'd live there. In a heartbeat.\n\nAnd the menu isn't too bad either. I need to go back for dinner but the Onion + Brioche Soup and Mac-N-Cheese we sampled were both super tasty. I just wish there would have been more.\n\nIf you want to sit at the bar or communal tables, I'd suggest getting there as close to 5 p.m. as possible. If not, make yourself a reservation and soak up a little modern Americana."
0,"I called this place to get my windows tinted they said \""$120 with 3 yr warranty and $159 for lifetime warranty\"" ok I thought great who needs more than a 3 year warranty on tint, $120 let's do it! So I go down to drop my car off and that's when the bait and switch happened. I get there and they tell me that the $120 option is with the cheaper film and will fade in about 2 years but I can get the better film for $159. Well long story short I ended up leaving because when I called they did not mention anything about different film, just different warranty.  I got my tint done for $150 anyways,  which is fine since the company was honest when I called and didn't bait and switch me."
4,"Great Italian. Very fancy, very nice, very good presentation.  Very intimate and cool ambiance.  We really enjoyed ourselves!"
0,I want to give cox no stars but it doesn't allow me!!! I had century link for internet and I never had any issues ever and I was paying around $40 a month for internet... When I moved my house wasn't century link ready so instead of paying the fees I switched to cox! Worst mistake!!! I pay $50 for not even half of the internet speed century link gave me.. Netflix takes forever to load or won't load... Internet randomly goes out I can't even load apps on my phone sometimes it's faster to turn wifi off!!! But the part that's gotten me really mad is that I can't do my job required courses at home!!! I now have to go somewhere else with internet connection because the one I pay for is a piece of crap!!! Another thing being on hold for 45mins waiting for a technician is also pathetic! I expected better cox I really did!!
4,"Awesome Dickey's!! Friendly staff, amazing food, and nothing beats free ice cream!!"
4,"This is an absolutely fabulous doughnut shop.  They make amazingly delicious doughnuts in flavors you would have never thought of.  Chocolate with cocoa  puffs.\nOr how about a maple bar with BACON. Yes I said it BACON.  How unique is that??? The service is just as great, friendly, fast, fresh!!!! I highly recommend it."
3,"Moved close by and went here for the first time loved it, Kay is awesome she's really good but time efficient at the same time which is very hard to find sometimes. Normally I get someone at a different salon who is slow but does good or someone who is fast but not good she is the perfect blend of both. Very pretty salon with beautiful pedi bowls and massage chairs. Not over priced and quality work, big selection of gel colors to choose from and comftorable setting! I give it a thumbs up and will be coming here from now on to see Kay."
1,"One of the worst foods in Vegas can be experienced here while you wait for your flight.\n\nChicken & mushroom soup consisted of half & half , salt, beans, questionable chicken, lots of cheese & sour cream....I mean 40% sour cream rather than being soup\n\nFries - ok\n\nSandwich - bread is dry, everything is flavorless \n\nIt's a good place to chill if you don't be under the intense white lights & with fat tourists on the uncomfortable chair by your gate, but food is pretty gross."
3,"24 hour trips to vegas are the best. moon definitely fulfilled our last minute vegas urge and made our road trip worth it. \n\nknowing someone in the vegas circuit helped a lot. although our 3 guys didnt get in as easily as the girls, their wait really wasnt that long (they got to cut in front of the line and got in 15 minutes after us) and we ALL got in for FREEE..\n\nthe music was good. the lighting was good. the view was good. the easy access to the playboy club was good. the upper level and outter deck area was good. cant complain!! always fun times in vegas!!!"
1,Roast pig was very fatty. The noodle soups were horrible. The bbq pork was okay. The fried rice was tasty. Would not return.
4,HGVC is my families favorite place to stay while on vacation in Vegas. It's conveniently located next to the much larger Hilton Hotel which is within walking distance. I personally like the low key quiet environment of this location because it's great for families and persons wanting to go nuts at night and causal relaxed in the day with a lay at the pool or ping pong on the 1st floor. \n\nParking is not gated outside but every time I've stayed here I've seen a security guard strolling around the parking grounds. The staff is very nice but never forget anything in your room because we left about $400 worth of jewelry in the room dresser only to later find out the room was cleaned and nothing was turned in.. =(\n\nBesides that minor incident I still feel the one staff member that wasn't honest enough to turn it in doesn't represent Hiltons great service. \n\nI've stayed here close to 8 times and hope they keep up the great work because this place is a real gem!
1,"I paid $20 for a seafood pan fried noodle that was pretty bland. I ordered takeout, so if I had to say one good thing about this place, its that it took them about 5 minutes to make my food.\n\nOther than that, if you're at the casino and you're hungry, do yourself a favor and get out to In-N-Out. Or, walk across the street to Panda Express and/or McDonald's."
1,Good atmosphere but the food is overpriced and midiocre.  I had a collection of appetizers at the bar that were not large enough portions.  We were ignored by the bartender for quite a long time as well; and the place was almost empty.
1,"The room was nice, but the hotel and casino was not layed out very well. It took me the entire trip to figure out my way around. The pool is the worst I have seen in Vegas. There is no sun on the pool at all. You have to go up to another deck away from the pool to find any sun. I would not stay here again."
2,"Ok. So this place was not as bad as the reviews sound but everyone has a different experience. If you're looking for a fancy hotel to get the Vegas experience, this is not the hotel for you but if you're looking for something that's somewhat close to the strip and cost-efficient this is the place for you.The video they have on their website makes the hotel look extravagant and while this place does look nice, it is not as fancy at is as it is portrayed in the video. \n\nCONS:\nFor example, there's no one waiting for you at the front of the hotel. It does not take two minutes to be in your room. It's not the staffs fault for not being in our room promptly, it's the fact that the gates to enter into the room area did not work with our key and we had to try multiple doors to see which key opens the door. The \""Jacuzzi\"" is a soaking tub with jets that do not work. There are some dings on the walls and the furniture but nothing too bad. \nThe outside walls need to be repaired because there are cracks and metal bars exposed. \n\nPROS:\n Now onto the positives of this hotel. It is only about a $5-$10 drive to the strip. It is located across the hard rock Hotel which is nice. For the price you pay you get a decent room. They remodeled the bedrooms to make them look more modern. They have comfortable Hamic's in the courtyard. The courtyard itself was maintained and look nice. The staff was friendly and helpful.\n\nNEUTRAL:\nThis place allows pets which may or may not be good depending if you are an animal lover. In our situation, we stayed in a room where there was a barking Chihuahua a couple rooms down and we could hear it barking throughout the night. \nthere was no actual comforter,it was more like two thin sheets nicely placed and fitted. This is great if you are one of those people who like to sleep with a little bit of sheets but if you are one of the people that get cold and need something warm then this may not be ideal.\nThey have free porn, but they are outdated;)\n\nAll in all, I would stay there again. It's cost-efficient, a mile and a half from the strip, and the rooms are nicely decorated to give you that modern feel."
0,"It saddens me to see this place go downhill from what it once was.  I always order the steak here, which used to be amazing.  Along with the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street, it would make for an incredible experience. Last time I was here, I had to spit out a good portion of my steak because it was not edible.  It used to be amazing quality here but they raised the prices and lowered the quality."
0,"I placed an order online for a 3 piece cast iron skillet set that was on sale for $17.99. It was a Christmas gift for my friend because that was what he wanted.  I got an email from Sears confirming the order and that it was available at this location.  In the email it said wait for a \""ready for pickup\"" email. My friend was at Sears at Meadows Mall at the time I placed the order and he said he saw several of the 3 piece set. An hour later I get an email from Sears telling me there will be a delay for my order and that they will email me the next day.  I get an email the next day saying the 3 piece set was out of stock and they cancelled my order and they told me they were refunding my money. I decided to go online and check to see if they were really out of stock.  After checking I found out they had some in stock at this location and the price had went up to $21.99. I feel like Sears scammed me by wanting me to buy it for $21.99 instead of the $17.99 I had paid for when I ordered it. Do I feel like this is a fair business? No I don't. I will never order anything else from any Sears because they may do this again. My friend was looking forward to receiving that 3 piece cast iron skillet for his Christmas gift. I refuse to fall for Sears scam and pay the $21.99.  I'm telling all of my friends that shop at Sears about what happened and hopefully they will stop shopping at any Sears."
4,"Bought a 25 yr old townhome as my new residence. Gut job. After removing old appliances and professional painters, garage door did not work. Looked at Yelp for help. Was pleased with what I read about Dreikosen: but the actual experience was even better than the reviews!! On time (actually early) and he really knew his stuff. No upsell, no gloom and doom, and a very fair price."
1,"TGIF is always my last resort kind of place. The food is meh...you get what you order and its obviously cooked by someone who's not a cook. The drinks are standard giving this place nothing special. Food quality below average to average.\nThe service is slow and inacurrate. It never seems like they care about you giving service quality poor.\nThe price is average. Not much to say about the price because it's mostly cheep, but so is the food. Value below average to average. \nOver all there's not much to say about TGIF. Definitely not worth going out of your way for or visiting when Phoenix has so much to offer. My advice to TGIF...do something big and unique and train your staff."
1,"My friend and I made appointments together for mani-pedis for first thing when the salon opened at 9 a.m. on a Thursday. The salon is spacious and clean, and has two pedicure areas...one that is a row, and one that is circular. When putting us \""next\"" to each other in the circular area, we were at 30 degree angles to each other's backs. A bit difficult to carry on a conversation. No one asked us how we wanted our appointments handled, just rushed at us both with one person on the feet and one person on the hands all at once. We were looking forward to a relaxing pedicure, then a leisurely manicure before a nice lunch. One out of three happened. We had a nice lunch. \nBoth of us have regular salons we go to, but this was half way between our residences, and that is why we chose it. \nYou would have thought there was going to be a stampede of customers the way they rushed us through our grooming. \nOnce finished, we each paid by credit card. No tips are allowed to be added to charges, but they will happily direct you to the ATM they have right inside the salon. \nI gave the man who did my pedicure a $20.00 bill and told him that was for both my friend and myself for our gratuities. He said, \""all FOUR?\"" I told him...yeeees, for the two of us, for all four people who helped us. Again, he repeated, \""All FOUR?\""  And it became quite clear he was not happy with that amount of a tip. Two manicures, two pedicures, approximately $120.00, and we were given the bum's rush. I thought it was quite generous all things considered. There was no thank you, no hope to see you again. \nFive days later, my friend told me that her cuts were healing. The man cut her in four places on her heel. And her French manicures on her toes and fingers were already cracking and chipping. Nice.\nNot to worry. We shall not darken your door again."
4,"I don't write reviews unless they are warranted.  I expect a company that I pay to come and get the job done.  To get a review they need to earn it.  In this case, Cool Blew exceeded my expectations and has earned this positive review.  They communicated in a timely manner, arraigned for my repairs, and repaired my AC exactly as they said.  \n\nThe techs Shane and Jimmy were both professional, punctual, and straight shooters.  They did not upsell me on unnecessary parts, service, or units.  They accurately diagnosed the issues with my HVAC, repaired the defective parts, and did not cut any corners during the repairs.  It was repaired the right way the first time, and I got exactly what I expected.  I have no reservation recommending this company to my family and friends and I will continue to use this company for my future needs."
1,"I was in a hurry and running way behind schedule. I just wanted to grab a quick bite. I assumed that stopping off at Red White & Blue (in Mandalay Bay) and grabbing a sandwich and a salad from the deli case would be a quick solution to my schedule conflicts. I mean, the sandwiches and the salad was pre-made...right?? How long could that take? \n\nIt takes about 35 minutes. I waited about 5 minutes in line to give my order to a girl behind the counter....she then scribbles my order down and hands me a receipt and hands another girl a carbon copy of my order. I go to the register to pay about $27 for my turkey sandwich, small Caesar salad and a bottle water. WHOA!!! \n\nI stand off to the side and watch a girl take my salad from the deli case, put it in a bag then push it to the side. I waited and waited....after about 20 minutes I asked the girl at the register what the hold up was....she turned around and said that the girls had not started making my sandwich yet. WHAT!?? Another girl comes over and asks me what I ordered...I simply said \""Don't you have a carbon copy of my order?\"" and she had the nerve to look at me with one eyebrow raised and say \""Obviously I don't...thats why Im asking you\"". So I told her my order...again and asked another girl to get a manager. I had to wait for that too! Are you serious? I finally get my order handed to me and Im standing around when some guy comes up to me and pokes me on my shoulder from behind and just says \""Hi\"". Hello....who are you? Oh...the manager...well why didnt you say so?! I tell him the issue that I had to wait a little over 35 minutes for a pre-made salad and a turkey sandwich when there are 6 girls behind the counter. Not to mention I had to watch people who ordered about 15 minutes after me get their food before me b/c the girls lost my order ticket somewhere between the register and the sandwich prep table....all of 6 feet. Then I get attitude handed to me by some girl behind the counter who thought she was just about the cutest and funniest thing to walk the Earth. Yeah...this $27 sandwich better be gold plated! \n\nTo say the least...service sucked...wait time was outrageous and the food was comparable to Subway. \n\nHere is my theory on customer service so you can better understand why I get so frustrated: \n#1 Your customer should not have to ask for anything. Meaning...always be one step ahead of them. Have some flippin common sense. If you see their drink is empty or on its way...refill it. If you serve them a burger....bring ketchup even if they didnt ask for it. Duh. \n#2 Never act like your customer is an inconvenience. Dude...they are paying for a service!!! They don't have to spend their money in your establishment...they can go somewhere else! Make them happy they chose to come to you. \n#3 Best advertising is word of mouth. You treat your customers well...they will be back and so will their friends. You screw it up...and everyone will know."
3,"WOW...What a find!  I just didnt feel like cooking so I went online  for delivery.  We got Orange chicken (enough for 3 people)  an order of Lo Mein (again, enough for 3 people)  Egg flower soup, fried rice (yup, enough for 3) egg rolls.......And every single thing was so tasty.  It all tasted so fresh and it arrived hot and ready to eat...which we sure did.  So the 3 of us ate and had left overs for $25.  \n\nOh and Eat 24 said delivery would take about an hour, but it arrived in 30 minutes.\n\nWill definitely order again.....Off to eat my fortune cookie with a hot cup of tea........Happy Eating All !"
0,"First of all, I don't like to give bad reviews, and I generally consider myself a patient person, but I came here after working a 13 hour shift and I was starving. Gave my name to the host for a table for two, waited a good 15 mins, gentleman who comes in after, gets seated before me, really? Um ok? Finally seated and drink orders placed, my iced green tea tastes like dirty water. Then we order a couple things (I generally don't do AYCE sushi because I find the fish isn't good) so I opted to do a la carte for my first visit. I don't like rolls with mayo, or dairy, or sauces like \""orgasm sauce\"". I immediately noticed the rice to fish ratio was way off, fish was dry, rice was dry. Great.\n \nNow let me get to the service.....we couldn't get our server to come around once, the cutest little old lady sitting at the table next to us flagged a server down for her check and then told them that we needed our server as well. Again, never saw her. At this point it's when I contemplated walking out and leaving money for what I thought we owed. Service was atrocious. Never refilled my drink and couldn't order any more food, which was probably a good thing. I will never give this place a second try or recommend. Overrated."
4,"Okay I think SOL's rating is completely skewed. As a 22 year old Arizona native, SOL is the best combination of delicious Mexican food and a modern, fun atmosphere in the valley. Comparable to Blanco, the menu is more original but more expensive as well. Their margaritas are to die for, I've tried nearly every flavor.  I hate cocktails that taste flavored with syrup or too much sugar, but SOL's flavored margaritas taste fresh and natural. As far as a food goes, I usually fill up on their unique tostada/bean dip/salsa (as opposed to traditional chips and salsa) and margaritas, I only have one or two street tacos. Filling and I end up not spending a ton as well.\n\nSOL is one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale, it's definitely somewhere to check out!"

3,"4.5 stars for sure. I've been to Vegas about 5 times and stayed at a different hotel every time and the Bellagio has definitely been my favorite thus far. We didn't stay in a sweet or anything like that but our room was really nice and spacious with a big, comfortable bed.\nThe bathroom was perhaps my favorite part. Everything in the room was nice including all of the surfaces. The bathroom was really nice and big, and featured a stand up shower and a tub. \nOut of all of the hotels I've stayed at, the biggest room, biggest and most comfortable bed, best location on the strip, and best bathroom hands down. Staying at a hotel with a good location on the strip is key if you don't want to shell out a lot of money on cab rides and the location doesn't get any better than the Bellagio (in between the Cosmo and Caesar's Palace and across from Paris). \nDefinitely the best room I've stayed in and one of my most enjoyable trips to Vegas."
0,I get that some of you are into getting poor service for kicks. And you love how obnoxious the wait staff is and you just love the paper hats that degrade you.\n\nIt was so awkward. Two of the girls in our party were into it and the rest of us were just scared to ask for extra napkins. I wouldn't have minded that much except that food is horrible and overpriced. The whole time I just wished I was at the Burger Bar.
3,"I'll start by saying I'm a Realtor, so my car needs to be clean. Needless to say I have recently become very particular about where I take my car to get clean. This Clean Freak is pretty good. I pay for the unlimited washes per month. $17 is all it costs me and I'm at this place at least twice a week. \n\nThis place always gets my car clean, as you would expect it would, but the staff is always courteous and there is never a line for the fast pass which makes this car wash more unique. One thing that I would mention is that it is very hard to find a vacuum most times when I am there and they do not have the high pressure air and bug removal station like the Clean Freak on Camelback. Heads up Clean Freak, some of the people at the vacuums didn't get their car washed! If it wasn't so easy for the guy pulling off the street, not getting his car cleaned but just looking for free vacuums, people paying would be more able to use the vacuums. Other than that this place is great."
1,"Ate here last night.  My son and I both ad pita sandwiches....mine,the lamb, which was tasty, but not much lamb, mostly lettuce.  My son had the beef, which had a little more meat in it, but not much.\n\nOur bigger complaint was one of our servers who was rude!  We were served some type of bread, encased in  Saran, which I thought was a little odd since we had ordered sandwiches, but as I reached for it and actually had my HAND on it, the first server runs by, grabs it out of my hand with the comment that we were NOT to have been served that!   Really?  Ok, so another server made an error, but once it's on the table, be gracious enough to just let it go.  It's only bread, anyway.\n\nThen, we are served our pita sandwiches, wrapped nicely in paper, and as I'm unwrapping it, Rude Server, once again, GRABS it out of my hand, to \""enlighten\"" me on how this is to be eaten, partially unwrapping it and handing it back to me.  Does the same routine with my son.\n\nFrankly, I'm a little put off by a server who grabs food out of my hand, TWICE, (or anyone else, when I'm hungry!), so between Rude Server, and not so much meat, I would think twice about revisiting if it weren't so close to home."
1,"I visited Macayo's because I heard that they had a gluten-free menu. \n\nWe sat outdoors on the cute, pleasant patio. The environment was somewhat marred by the presence of cigarette smoke. I know business owners can accept smoking on patios, but they can also choose to make patios smoke-free, and I find the latter much more pleasant. \n\nService was pretty good, but our server did seem in a hurry to get us out of there. Although it was 3 hours before close, she started asking if we wanted to-go boxes about 15 minutes after we got our food.  \n\nI had beef fajitas and my partner had a burro. We also ordered guacamole. The guacamole tasted kind of gummy, and the chips were too dry, papery, and flavorless. Also, we found cucumbers in the guacamole, and later in the pico de gallo. Who puts a freaking cucumber in either of those things?\n\nMy fajitas were very bland in flavor. The meat was cheap and had been chemically tenderized, with the result that the texture was pulpy. Instead of seared, it was just browned. It looked as though it had been steamed in a microwave, to be honest. Also, they used too much tenderizer, and it took the top skin off of my tongue. Gross. \n\nRefried beans tasted kind of cakey. Otherwise ok. Again, guac was gummy with a strange taste. \n\nMy partner said his burro was boring and had not much flavor. \n\nWe asked about flan, but learned that it contains gluten. There is ZERO reason that flan should contain any gluten, so I am guessing their flan was made from some kind of mix. Again, gross. \n\nI won't be returning to Macayo's."
4,"When it comes to chicken wings, WOW!! this place has the 10000 star if there was one! Amazing wings, hot or mild..very soft.. quick and very friendly staff, the owner is very friendly too. One of my favorite local places to go visit when I crave wings"
2,My family & i think this place is better than it was before.  They are improving with every visit
4,"This is one of my favorite bakeries in Charlotte. For me it is the quintessence of what a bakery should be. It smells buttery and sweet when you walk through the door. I absolutely LOVE the cupcakes. They are moist, fresh, and flavorful.  I really like their signature Almond icing. I've also ordered a red velvet birthday cake from here. It was the highlight of the birthday party. It was delicious, beautiful and reasonably priced.  \n\nI have to intentionally restrict myself from coming here weekly (I'd be as big as a house if I indulged every craving for this place :-) Lucky for me, the new location is not as convenient. Otherwise, I'd be in here a lot more. They have free wi-fi and a few lunch items that I plan to try soon (tomato and asiago soup), but I'm so addicted to the pastries I haven't tried anything else.\n\nIf you have a sweet tooth, this place should definitely be in your rotation."
0,"My mom and I went to this location for a morning smoothie. I remembered seeing a groupon available and I bought it waiting in line to order for 5 for $15. When I ordered the cashier rudely told us they don't participate in Groupon's and offered no apology. On the door is a whole letter explaining they aren't accepting Groupon's. They need a sign simply stating \""Groupon's Not Accepted\"" because who is really going to read an entire letter while walking in? We spend over $17 for 3 smoothies. Plus the $15 for the Groupon. Of all the locations in the valley only 4 aren't accepting them. These locations should just be a part of the team and not give Jamaba Juice a bad name.\nThe smoothies are just ok and the staff looks miserable in silly hats they are obviously forced to wear. I won't be coming back again. I'll take my business to a team player location even after my Groupon's are used up!!!"
4,"This was my first time visiting Daily Dose and I think I got really lucky!  I went for brunch on a Sunday and only had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table on the patio.  The main reason for the 5 stars is because I had one of the best veggie burgers of my life!  If you follow my other reviews, you will see that I'm a big supporter of quality veggie burgers and I try them everywhere I go.  This one was definitely memorable and moves into my top 3 in Phoenix.  The patty is homemade with tasty grains and herbs - not frozen or too hard.  The bun is a fatty delicious pretzel bun which is fantastic but probably not the healthiest option.  It comes with a great yogurt dill sauce that gives it a little Mediterranean flare.  Or it with waffle fries if you're feeling crazy!  \n\nIf you don't like veggie burgers.... you can't go wrong with any of their pancakes, omelets or breakfast nachos!"
2,"Delivery is not really an option....great pizza, huge fan, but when I live 2 miles away and can't get delivery when it's advertised, why even say delivery....apparently it's only within walking distance from the place and only to 4 casinos..."
4,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is consistently excellent and VERY reasonably priced. I especially love the cheese pie and baked kibbee, but everything on the menu is pretty delicious!"
2,"it was pretty good mainly because i was able to buy and use a coupon from yelp on the spot besides that the food is good not extraordinary but good decent place for a lunch , the only downside to it is the service I don't know if they got more people working for dinner time but at lunch the two ladies were more worried about some other issue than the costumers they had i didn't know what because they speak in another language  , the one that was taking care of me and my friend couldn't really communicate fluently with us but she got the order good , it was a nice lunch I wasn't blown away but I'll stop by any other time ..."
3,"Lots of slots to gamble if you're bored and waiting for your flight. Decent airport....doesn't take long to get through security. Plenty of food to choose from and eat. \n\nBeen here 3-4x , not bad"
2,"Tried this place because it is a sister restrauant of el gallo blanco.  It's like el gallo blanco without the wait. Tried a couple of things on their menu and liked them all. Shrimp cocktail was good, all the tacos were great, and the alcohol drinks like sangria were good also."
0,"While I cannot comment on the food, I must say that I have never been so insulted by an establishment in my entire life.  \n\nI was extremely excited to go to Piccolo Forno for my birthday as I have had my eye on it for several years, but just haven't seemed to be able to find the opportunity.  I will admit that the decision was made a bit last minute, so I wasn't surprised when they said that they were booked for reservations.  They did say that I could come in and put my name down on the list and wait, so I opted to do that and head over to Round Corner Cantina for a couple drinks and appetizers.  When I first arrived at 7:15, they had previously estimated that the wait would be about 2 hours, and I appreciated it when they gave me a call at around 9pm to let me know it would be another 45 minutes and to find out if I still wanted to wait.  I told them very clearly that I would still like to wait, as my party seemed relatively content at the time.\n\nAbout an hour later, when we went over to check to see how much longer it would be, the hostess informed us that someone had called and said to cancel the reservation sometime after they had called me to confirm I would still like to wait.  Huh?  I told the hostess that there was no way this had happened as everyone in my party was still waiting.  She flatly told me that there was nothing they could do and that the reservation had been canceled.  One of the other hostesses started looking around the restaurant, trying to figure out if there was any way to fit my group in, but the original hostess shot her down and said there was no way we could possibly get seated (it was already past 10pm by this time).  There was no apology or anything, and I left extremely upset.  \n\nI am not certain if it was another patron looking to get a seat sooner that called, or if one of the employees was looking to get home earlier and didn't want to deal with a group of 8 at a relatively late hour.  Regardless, I was extremely insulted that they did nothing to try to remedy the fact that we had been waiting for a table for over 3 hours.  We ended up having to go to a bar in order to get food since it was already too late for most restaurants, and it pretty much ruined everybody's night since we all were so hungry and grumpy.\n\nWhile I was looking extremely forward to trying Piccolo Forno since I had heard so many great things about their food, I will never patronize the restaurant due to the rude and insulting customer service."
2,"Was very excited to go here with friends only to be disappointed. \nLe Cirque is a beautiful dining room overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Our table was next to the window so we had a great view. \nThe service is incredible and friendly, but the food, I've had better. \n\nOn the menu you will definintely find decadent choices with both appetizers and entrees. They also have an excellent wine list. \nAfter a few questions about the menu we ordered.\n\nOur appetizers arrived. I had the crab salad, which was a lite salad topped with hearts of palm, caviar and spinkled with pomegranate seeds. Nice and fresh tasting. One of the ladies in my party had the fois gras which she said was very good, another - escargot which she said was good. However 2 of us got the lobster and avocado salad, which the lobster was so tough it was hard to cut. \nWhen we mentioned it to our server, two men came back to our table, one remarked it must be our knife. (Really? not the response I expected) Uh.. no it's tough.. Since this is what I ordered for my entree, I asked if I could change my order to the Hamachi, they said no problem. \n\nOur entrees came, two of the ladies did enjoy their sea bass and black bass. However the sea bass presentation could have been better, It was wrapped in potato with a brown sauce.. (brown & white only on a plate, not too appetizing)\nAnother ordered venison, which she said was good, and another had the lobster risotto which she said was great.  The himachi I had was good, it sait on two pieces of avocado which were topped with rock salt, which was a bit much. Again it had heart of palm which was great. \n\nThey do say save the best for last and it was with dessert. I didn't order anything but 3 of the women got the chocolate ball, which I tasted. Rich dark chocolate poured over 3 to 4 different decadant chocolates. Beautiful presentation. \n\nAgain, the atmosphere nice, the service great, but the food?? For the price, I expected it to be one of the best meals I've ever had. With melt in your mouth food.  Unfortunately, I've had better."
0,"DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT have Lowes do ANY installation. I went with Lowes because of their reputation. What a mistake that was. They farmed out the installation to a low grade contractor and when that contractor made a MAJOR mistake, Lowes did nothing but push me off to deal with their contractor's insurance company.Lowes took NO responsibility at all. They talk about trusting them with taking care of the customers needs and how they will do the right thing. Well, guess what, it is all false, a deception, could not be further from the truth, they suck you in and then when a mistake is made they absolve themselves of any blame or responsibility. They give it to their legal department, who are as vacant as a Detroit apartment building, they more of less tell you to go away and deal with someone else and you are left on your own to deal with the representative of Lowes who caused the damage.\n\nThanks Lowes, thanks for standing up for what you advertise, thanks for watching out for loyal customers, thanks for selling out, thanks for being the opposite of what you say you are.....thanks for nothing."
2,"Items Ordered:\nPecan Sticky Bun\nRed Velvet Cupcake\nChocolate Chip Cookie\nPeanut Butter Cookie\nOatmeal Raisin Cookie\nCampfire 'Smores Cookie\n\nLocated off the lobby of the recently rebranded Delano, with a trendy wooden d\u00e9cor \""inspired by desert shade'\"" and several styles of seating juxtaposing a small bar flanking a marble hearth, 3940 ups the ante in the world of casino coffee shops not only in terms of styling but also in offerings, a variety of overpriced artisan sandwiches served alongside an impressive lineup of pastries, lattes, juices, and teas.\n\nLegalistically named and across the way from Franklin it was just after 3pm that I arrived at the brightly lit bar and with folks from an ongoing tech conference occupying several tables as well as the leather recliners in the corner a quick chat with friendly baristas yielded a double espresso over ice and a six-part sampling of the day's pastries, the total just under twenty-seven dollars.\n\nNoting that $5 for a double over ice is more-or-less the going price at every Strip-side Starbucks suffice it to say that the Grand Avenue Roasted shots from 3940 are a significant upgrade over the competition, and with similar praise lavished on a warm sticky bun that somehow maintains crunchy layers of lamination beneath a mountain of candied pecans and butter one only wishes the rest of the wares could have been so good, the cupcake far better to look at than to eat given the substantially sweet and paste-thick icing while each of the cookies, save for graham-cracker caramel studded 'Smores, was almost brownie-dense and entirely one note.\n\nOffering better coffee than almost any coffee bar on the strip, along with several interesting lattes and fresh squeezed juices, but exceedingly expensive for sandwiches that look no more interesting than Panera it seems the best bet for a visit to 3940 is for beverages alone and although the sticky bun is quite excellent, an even better version can be had fresh to order from Della's Kitchen just down the hall."
0,"I have to say, me and my husband were having high expectations of this place. As soon as we were seated, I ordered a miso soup and my husband ordered a sushi sake. We decided to order our appetizers right away so we could save time and start eating since we were starving. We waited over 20 MINUTES to get the soup and then another 10 minutes to get the sushi. When I asked the waitress about the delay she said that we had over 50 orders ahead of us and that she was sorry that nobody warned us. Funny thing, though, was that the people seated in front of us ordered food about 3 times and they were served in a timely manner. The food wasnt even that good. I've had better miso soup for a lot less and the deep fried california roll was mushy. I would NOT recommend this place. Save your money and go somewhere else."
0,"I admit, I have a coffee addiction and I frequent Starbucks daily.  I recently started going to this store when my job moved to this side of town. I only went here for a week because I almost always received the most unfriendly service at this store. There are a couple baristas here that are amazing, but the attitude from others is enough for me to have started going to the Warm Springs and 215 store."
2,"REPOSTING THIS, GOT DROPPED PERHAPS BY THIS SITE'S REVIEW FILTER BECAUSE OF MY 1-STAR RATING? \n\nGAVE 3-STARS JUST SO THIS REVIEW IS GONNA STAY UP.\n\n(I believed others' reviews that's why I had my car serviced here. Unfortunately, I didn't have the same luck as them)\n\nI was supposed to give them 3 1/2-stars when I went there 2 weeks ago for my Passat's oil change. A mile away from my place, half an hour wait time (Wed or Thurs morning), slow wifi but pleasant staff, not pushy trying to offer extra services. But last Sunday, while driving on 215, I suddenly heard a loud dragging noise under the engine. Turned out, it's the plastic belly pan (sound deadener) covering the bottom part of the engine! The dowel pins may have not put back in properly that's why they popped out! Called VW dealer earlier, a belly pan costs $200 + tax (kit including pan and attachments, pins) no labor cost yet!!! To think VW dealer only charges $65 for synthetic oil change; cheaper than Jiffy Lube! I will never go back to Jiffy Lube! Costly mistake!"
3,"Thanks so much for a lovely experience. So nice to sit outside under the misters on a warm afternoon. Hummus nachos went well with the delicious and unusual cocktails. The lavender gin fizz was terrific. Our salads were so freshly prepared with spinach, avocado, and a lovely bit of salmon. Great ambience outdoors, and a nice wine list to boot."
3,"Remarkable sleek modern pizza lounge. They managed to successfully transform a historic department store building in downtown Phoenix into a hip yet casual and fairly priced lounge. Cool atmosphere and fantastic pizza. We tried the Prosciutto di Parma and Quattro pizzas and they were both great. Overall a pleasant spot to hit with friends for food and retro-drinks, including some absinthe-based cocktails. Service was just OK, perhaps a bit on the snobbish side."
3,"This place is pretty good if you like cheap, quick chinese food.  I love the General Chicken.  You have to watch out because they tend to make it all pretty spicy.  The price is very cheap and they give quick service.  I would recommend it for take out not eat at the place."
0,"My first two expereiences with C&G were great. I took in some watches to get a band fixed or battery replaced and it was done while I was there. I was in and out in 10 minutes with a fixed watch at a good price. The last time I went in (8/11/12) was horrible though. I dealt with an older gentleman (whom I had not dealt with previously) and on Staurday afternoon he took two of my watches (one needed to be cleaned and one needed the bracelet reattached), looked at them and said they would be ready on Tuesday. I was not able to make it back in until Wednesday afternoon but when I walked in the older lady who was out front looked around for a bit and then said they were not done. My annoyed blank stare must have prompted her to ask if I could come back later that afternoon. They took my number so a call would have been nice leeting me know they were not ready. Regardless, I came back three hours later to find that the one watch was cleaned but they were just begining to work on the other. I said that I could not wait around so I would take it back broken and pay for the cleaned one. While I am sure I was visibly annoyed, I said thank you, paid, said thank you again and walked toward the door. At this point the older lady made a comment under her breath. I turned around and said \""Excuse me?\"" she replied \""There goes a happy customer\"". I told her I was not happy and did not appreciate her comment. She stared blankly. \n\nI have no patience for a retailer treating a paying customer so poorly and will not return."
1,"Went in for the first time a couple weeks ago- aside from an undrinkable cocktail that needed to be sent back it was a pleasant enough dining experience. The food was solid, servers seemed a bit overwhelmed but were adequate, and the ambiance was great. We thought we would give it another go last night but were disappointed. After being seated we failed to receive any acknowledgement from our section's server. After a solid 15 minutes of being ignored we decided to take our money elsewhere. \n\nFortunately there are many more put together operations for good food and drink in downtown Chandler (Vintage 95 and San Tan to name a few) and we will be giving them our business, at least until The Perch makes some necessary improvements."
4,"I'm listening to 2 Live Crew as I'm writing this so I'm feeling extraordinarily misogynistic. Forgive a brotha. \n\nThere are two things you should know about this place, and it pretty much sums up my entire existence... \n\nTake a girl here on a lunch date. She will see you as sensitive and intuitive. You may want to use phrases like \""I feel...\"" and \""When Carrie gave her assistant that Louis Vuitton...\""\n\nOrder the Mushroom tart. Or is it tort? \n\nIf you follow my advice, gentlemen, you'll have a great day. Good luck. And god speed."
3,"The hype this place gets is a little excessive but it pretty much lives up to it. While I wasn't fully blown away by the two sandwiches I tried (I ordered The Original and my gf got the Full Montague), they were still great sandwiches. I blame it on the fact that I  was eating them stone cold sober and not at 3am after a night of sweaty gyrating and fist pumping on the dance floor. \n\nPrice-wise this is as good as it gets on The Strip. It was about $6 for a 6 in. sandwich - very worth it. Also, open 24 hrs so come one come all at all hours of the day or night. \n\nMenu is fairly extensive with soups, salads, and desserts as well so you have a great many option to choose from in your drunken stupor. \n\nDefinitely make a stop here on your next trip :-)"
1,"\""BEST OF LAS VEGAS - DELI  - REVIEW JOURNAL EDITOR'S CHOICE 2011\""    \n\nWell set the Delorean, because my experience here wasn't the best of anything.  \n\nTo be fair, I didn't try any of the items they're probably known and liked for (namely Bagels, Stuffed Cabbage, Corned Beef).   Went here for lunch with a friend and decided to just go with a classic Club Sandwich.   My friend ordered a side of fries so I grabbed a handful of those as well.   \n\nThe club was okay overall, the ham and turkey tasted fine and there was plenty of it to enjoy.   The bacon tasted gristly to me though and not in a good way (sometimes I can like gristle).  I actually pulled out the bacon from the 2nd half of the sandwich and just straight up removed it.   You read that right:  I REMOVED BACON FROM A CLUB SANDWICH AND AVOIDED EATING IT.    It's, it's.... it's just not right  The fries were, for lack of a better word, awful.   I'm drawing a blank thinking of a fry I'd rather not eat again. \n\nLast but not least was the price.  My sandwich was $12 before tax.   I'm not against paying $12 for a flawless sandwich, but just thinking about the other eats even in the same shopping center I could get for $12 (let alone the extra I paid for a drink) and my head starts to hurt.\n\nYOU RUINED BACON AND FRENCH FRIES LEVY.   Be happy with your 2."
0,"Avoid.\n\nCame in when website listed they would be open, but it wasn't. So we walked the lot for 30 minutes looking at cars and finally decided to call the dealership number. Lady said times listed were for repair shop. Well... okay... maybe someone should fix that?\n\nLeft, came back in the afternoon.\n\nWalked around the lot, nobody approached us.\n\nDecided to go inside, nobody greeted, acknowledged or approached us. So we uncomfortably stood around for 15 minutes looking at the showroom models and reading brochures. \n\nWe decided to leave when an obese man wearing extremely tight clothes approached and asked if we needed some help. \n\nYes. We are interested in a car.\n\nSo we went onto the lot to look at some specific cars. We asked about pricing and why the listed prices were several thousand higher than other dealerships in the region. The salesman explained that the prices were marked just barely up enough to make a profit.\n\nSorry... we started laughing. I mean, come on guy. Am I supposed to believe these are the most profit-hating car salesmen in history? The lying was obvious, and shameful. By the way, if you're going to give a line like that, at least try not to stutter and look away while saying it. \n\nWe went to look at a slightly used model, and asked why the two year old car was marked $2,500 more than what Kelly Blue Book was listing.\n\n\""Well, Kelly Blue Book is just a standard.\""\n\nUh huh... Yah think? \n\nWe explained that we wanted to test drive a car. After asking which one, he said he would need to copy the drivers license and fill out some forms (never been asked that at any dealership before... but okay). \n\nAfter a bit, he came back with the keys and said he was sorry we had to wait so long... this was his first week on the job and the manager told him he should see if we needed help. \n\nThat made us more uncomfortable. It's apparent someone sized us up coming into the place and decided we weren't worth the time so we got the half-wit rookie. Okay, it's one thing to give the new guy a chance, it's another to be sized up.\n\nWell, the rookie went to get the car. We waited on the curb for about 10 minutes... kicking rocks and waiting. Maybe he got lost? \n\nHe finally shows up, hops out and then proceeds to open the doors and show us the car, pointing out obvious things like, \""as you can see, the back door swings all the way open.\""\n\nNo kidding?\n\nThen he says, \""we don't do test drives 30 minutes before closing, and we close at 5.\"" \n\nOh, well then by all means, let's NOT buy a car. I'm more than happy to take money to a competitor.\n\nWe couldn't even drive the thing around the lot, nothing. But where to start with this?\n- salesman wont make any extra effort\n- dummy wasted time that could have been used to get us into a car before closing \n\nHe then asked us to make an appointment to come back for a test drive. We said absolutely not and for all of the reasons described above, and adding that we felt like we were treated very badly and will not be purchasing a car from this lot. \n\nAfter we left, we got a call from the Chevy dealership across town at about 7 p.m.. The Chevy salesman was profusely apologizing for not returning our phone call earlier... he had been with a customer up to that. He left his personal cell phone number and said to call him at any time. \n\nNow THAT'S how to behave as a professional.\n\nApparently that dealership doesn't shoo customers away at 5 p.m. We're going to keep shopping for the best deal in the region, but the Chevy dealership is already at the top of our list. \n\nBTW - if you Nissan folks ever read this: we said we were interested in buying one car, actually we were interested in buying two. We just wanted to see how we were treated first."
2,"Very quiet here (few people) & multiple times we've been here the same staffers have been here with consistency in both food & svc.  I should rate it higher but I don't eat Mexican that often out.  We actually were taken care of by the owner who was very pleasant.  He even checked on us & the other patrons.  We were entertained by his telling of some of his humorous work situation real life stories.  Oh, the food?  It's not bad $7.95 for a smoked beef salad with 2 sides & $7.95 for a shredded glazed chicken burrito.  We cared enough to share some of our marketing ideas with him.  See, we make the world go round."
1,"so i moved into a place across the street for the tempe location of 4 peaks before it had concrete laid outside...before it had a liquor license, and before it had a food menu.  so my history with what is available and what's good...what's come and gone is long and  detailed.  i have not written a review of the tempe location because i know it's quality is beyond words....\n\n that being said, i met some friends for breakfast last sunday @ the scottsdale location.  while the food was good it was not great and we noticed the potatoes that are being served are the frozen bag precut variety....and that was a bummer.  the eggs benedict was awesome but the potatoes were lacking with the same home fries quality that i'd come to know and expect.  our order was slow to be taken, and slow to come out,  not too bad because friends and i were there to catch up and what not.  overall i didnt have a bad experience and none of my friends did either just different... and somehow less than the tempe location is known to offer.  plus the lack of the good home fires was a disappointment"
1,"Wasn't crazy over the food. The restaurant is nice, pretty inside, but the food was definitely not the best"
0,"Disgusting! The salsa tasted like a can of puree tomatoes. The chicken tortilla soup had 3 small chunks of chicken and it tasted like a heated version of the salsa, hot puree tomatoes. Simply the worst meal I've had in a while. I will never return. In fact I felt robbed cause a cup of soup, chips n salsa and a Pepsi was $11.35 before tip. I know its Vegas but seriously. Do you know how many cans of tomatoes I could have bought with this money? I could have made nasty soup and salsa for our entire block!!!\n\nThis place was a hot mess down to the waiter who asked me every 5 freaking minutes if I needed anything."
4,"I cannot complain about a place that will deliver pupusas to our house! They also open early (at 8AM) and deliver breakfast. Eggs are always hot and the beans and platanos are always perfect. \nI have never eaten in the restaurant, only gotten delivery."
2,I've eaten here numerous times and am still amazed how popular these places are. It must be because they're open 24 hours and late at night it's one of the few places you can get something to eat fast. That's the only reason I eat here.\n\nThe good is soso. It fills you up but as far as being flavorful it leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nI'm sure I'll visit again. It serves a purpose.
2,"This spa is definitely smaller than others on the strip.  The facilities are nice, but it's the little things that need to be taken care of.  The hot tub had some dirt on the edges, the spa outsources the hot tub care, towels and cups were left throughout the facility and not picked up by the attendant, the coed hamman was nice but could definitely be lower light inside, and there were not many places to sit and relax.  The clientele during my visit seemed a bit odd as well, but that's not the hotels fault.   In closing, it's a bit small, but cheap to visit.   They need to work on the small details.   I probably won't be back."
3,"Surely this show offers something for everyone, assuming you can handle some inappropriate humor and colorful language.  I thoroughly enjoyed every performance, with my favorite being the comedic \""ballet\"" performed by the master of ceremonies himself, and his hilarious assistant.  There is just the right amount of a variety of acts and audience interaction.\n\nThe venue is great in that pretty much all seats in the house are good seats.  But the small seats are really packed in and you will become best buds with your neighboring seatmates, so hopefully you land good ones!  I recommend splurging and getting the seats with tables if you prefer not to literally rub elbows with the folks next to you."
3,"I want to give MB 5 stars, but honestly I have only stayed in now 2 hotels in Vegas so I don't feel qualified to give it 5. I thought the hotel had a nice variety of restaurants, though some had odd hours (for breakfast, etc) and they had a great band for entertainment at night, though not a real club at night. \n\nThe beach area is really nice. Loved that. The rooms are also spacious and quiet and the location is ideal. Close to everything. \n\nGreat value for the money."
4,"Does KA need another review with 171 reviews already? No. Am I going to write one? You betcha! \n\nEspecially after having gone the night before to see Criss Angel's Believe which gets 1 star. The difference in shows was unbelievable. \n\nEntering the theatre, you immediately begin looking around as the set projects out and over the seats. The ushers in costume are friendly, even when cautioning guests not to take photos. Indeed, as part of the show, a clueless patron gets first his camera tossed into the fire pit, then his cellphone and finally, he's tossed too! Of course, he's part of the cast, but the message about no photos and turning off one's cell phone is dramatically made. \n\nFrom that point on, the action never stops. Two cast members do a shadow puppet show that was funny, sweet and clever. Fight scenes are well choreographed and at times, riveting, particularly as the stage floats, sometimes being at a 90 degree angle. \n\nOur tickets were $165 which isn't cheap, but if you can afford it, it's a treat that's worth every penny. \n\nBefore the show, you can get a drink which are generously poured. If you have a weak bladder, forgo the drink, otherwise you'll be forced to visit the restroom and miss out on an amazing show."
0,"After a long night of clubbing, we were up for some breakfast at 4am.  While hailing a taxi cab, our attendant convinced us to go to this place (instead of another we had in mind).  Big Joe told us it was the best place to get some steak and eggs.  Well Big Joe, you were wrong.\n\nGranted, the food was decent.  The eggs weren't dry, and with a little salt and pepper, it made it just right.  Potato pieces always a plus.  I ordered my steak medium rare, which usually let's my meat be just the right texture - not too dry, and not too bloody.  Well, my meat was a bit on the dry side, so one can only imagine if I had even fathomed to order my meat well done.\n\nThen again, you get what you pay for.\n\nMy main complaint about this place was the service we received.  After a long wait to get our food (maybe I'm too used to the fast service I get in California?), we finished our food, and waited for the check.  I guess I'm used to getting the check before I'm done eating.  But we waited.  And waited....................... AND WAITED.\n\nWe tried asking the hostess for the check, but she just rudely stated she didn't know who our server was, and she simply couldn't help us.  From what I could see, there were only two servers at the time, so how hard was it to figure it out.  If the first one said no, THEN ASK THE OTHER!  And yes, we did try to get our waiter's attention.  Luck had it that he was serving two large groups.\n\nHowever, that is not an excuse for a good 30 minute long wait (or at least what felt like 30 minutes) for our check.\n\nReady to go to sleep, exhausted from a night of clubbing and suffering from a food coma,  we decided to do the right thing and leave money on the table before we left.  Yes, that's right, we never got our check.  At least we had the decency to leave money for our meal.  I know we could've just walked out and left, but we took the high road.\n\nWell, except for leaving this one star review that is."
3,"Convenient location, friendly staff, nice large modern rooms.   Breakfast is nicer than most places and the coffee is good.\n\nOnly thing that sucks is $18/night parking - in a crappy open paved lot.  For that money, at least have a garage or something."
0,"i dont like anything about this place.\n\nthe line...\n30 min till closing and there is still a line out the door? i cannot comprehend.\n\nthe quality of food\nfor the vegas style wait, it was not worth it.\n\nit is crowded and loud\nat least 4 people/kids ran into me\n\nif you eat a lot and want a variety of ok food, this is the place for you"
2,"It wasn't what I was expecting. I had a good time, but only stayed for one round. Prices aren't terrible, but there is no way at all to move around inside. If you want to be able to hear the people you're with, you have to go outside. A confusing mix of country music and crappy pop rock. It wouldn't be a place I'd go back to, but it wasn't terrible."
0,"As many of the reviews express there are some nice furnishings at Mod. The salespeople can be friendly when you actually talk to them in person but this is where the experience ends. \nI've been shopping the entire Valley for a sofa and found one there I actually liked at a fair price. A new one would have taken up to two months so I asked about the floor model and offered to let them keep displaying for three weeks till i moved to new place. \""we can't sell floor models\"" the sales manager said although all over the store there are Sold signs on floor models. \nHe gave me his card as I left and said to email any questions.  \nThe next day I did.  After a week there was no response so I called and talked to another designer/salesperson. I asked for info on manufacturer, dimensions and style. I was promised an email response. A day later nothing so I called and finally got the info sent.  \nI wanted to sit on it again so I returned to the store and talked to the designer that sent the info after multiple requests. I was told another one had shown up in their warehouse in a different color with awful accent pillows. I said I would think about it.  \nNext day I asked them to give me a price I can't refuse offer given all that had transpired and if good enough I would buy.  Four days later no response so I asked if email was received. They said yes but wouldn't negotiate.  I then gave a reasonable offer within 15% of asking price and still have not heard a word for many days.  \nThe company will not exist long if they don't do all they can to both follow up with customers and realize they won't have a job if they don't sell everything they can. The management needs to wake up and start doing some sales training as each time I was there the salespeople were more interested in ordering or eating lunch than making a sale.  They also need to know that with steep furniture competition (two stores right next to them) they won't last long as the only company that doesn't negotiate.  \nThere is a win win in every situation and business's that don't car about customer satisfaction don't win."
1,"The ambiance is 5 stars.\n\nWe went on a Friday night and were surprised when nobody was there.  Great dancefloor, but totally empty.\n\nOrdered a Jameson on the rocks.  \""That'll be $12.50.\"" \n\nAs Aunt Bunny would say:  Guuuurrl please.\n\nAnd...then we left.  FAIL."
3,"I was really excited when they offered a Groupon deal a few days before my Vegas trip.  Had I not had a Groupon I still would have come but it worked out that I was able to save $$ on my visit there.  I purchased a $25 Groupon for $50 worth of food and only had to pay gratuity in the end.  Score!\n\nWe got there around 11:30 a.m. on a Tuesday and there were only a handful of people in the restaurant at the time.  A little bit into our meal the place started filling up to capacity with convention goers.   We were seated in a side room toward the back of the restaurant where the tables were spaced out nicely and the chairs big and comfy.  \n\nI had their chicken sandwich with fries and to drink I had their Fruli Strawberry beer.  I requested for one ingredient to be left out of my sandwich because I was unfamiliar with it, and while that may have made it dry I still really enjoyed my sandwich and thought it was pretty tasty.  Their fries were absolutely delicious!  As for my drink, pretty good too :)  Dessert though was unmemorable.  I can't quite recall what exactly we had (so that should tell you something) but I do know that I wasn't crazy about it.  \n\nYay for a tasty meal (minus dessert), good service, and nice ambiance!  Four stars for Public House :)"
2,"I've only been in this Food Lion solely for the fact that I had to pick up something after being at the USNWWC.  \n\nYou can tell that the store is brand new (less than a year old) and well kept.  I found it a bit dark/cave-like inside, but then again most grocery stores follow the HT dim lighting vibe now a days.\n\nThis store never seems busy.. maybe because of it's location/newness... but it's good since you can get in and out fast.  Not-so-good if store standards aren't kept up due to the lack of demand....  but so far so good!"
4,"I've come to K-Bowl many times for the Korean food, and will do so again...it's very good. But other reviewers have covered that. What people may not be aware of is that they also have phenomenal chicken wings. I recommend the plain fried kind...it is definitely the best fried chicken I have had in C-U. It takes a while because it is freshly fried to order. But don't worry, it is worth the wait. It was so good that I had to go back and get it again the next day. I do not understand why this place is not full of people eating fried chicken all the time. Got a friend who's not a fan of Korean food, but you still want to eat together? Get em some fried wings, K-Bowl's got you covered."
2,"3.5 stars. The golf tavern was a convenient choice for us to go grab a drink, hang out, use the free wifi, maybe get a meal (the food is pretty decent btw). A drunken evening led the three of us here during one of the live band nights and it was a grand old time. I'm not too big a fan of watching sports at pubs so its not really my kind of scene."
2,"First time here. Decided to eat with friends after watching Harry Potter.  Cana Latin Kitchen bar dishes are served just like Firefly restaurant, in small servings so one dish will not fill you up. It's set that way so you can have the opportunity to taste other things on the menu without getting full.\n\nStepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together. The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though. Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well.\n\nDespite having only one server that night, she was very attentive to everyone inside. I'll give the service a good review. I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari). The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces.  Taste was ok but thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste.  I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces.  I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here. It was the best dish we had on our table.\n\nSo if you're ever around town square at night and on a movie date, stop by this place after. Great way to end a night if you don't feel like partying in the neighboring bars and just in a mood to have a quiet place to eat and have a conversation."
0,"I needed my eyebrows done and this place is right around the corner from where my family lives. I stopped in around lunchtime and the place was clean and the staff was friendly. I was led to one of the wax rooms and my experience went downhill. I don't know if this was the lady's first time waxing or if she was new, but it was terrible. Instead of removing the waxed strip in one swift motion, it was slow and painful causing her to have to redo the wax since she wasn't able to get all the stray hair and wax off. It felt very amatuer-like as if my girlfriends and I were doing an at-home wax kit. I was very displeased and left with wax along my hairline, eyebrows still with stray hairs, and $10 less in my wallet. I will not be returning back to this place."
2,"When it comes to sushi, I love exploring the variety of rolls and taking my tastebuds on incredible journeys. That being said, this place was friendly, clean, decently priced, and tasted fine. \n\nBut there was some pizzazz lacking. The roles were fairly standard with few options of real raw fish (lots of crab and shrimp options). Plus, I was also hard pressed to find many options without mayonnaise based sauces.\n\nHowever, I tried handrolls for the first time and they were delicious! The Unagi handroll and the No Name Handroll were both superb! \n\nGiven the wide variety of sushi joints in the area, this one was not for me. But I will recommend it to all my friends who love good California rolls and Handrolls. The fish was fresh and the service was fantastic! Plus, a friend of mine swears by their Udon soups!"
1,"Basic, bland cafeteria fare.  I had the beef burrito. Found the beef to be flavorless. The big tortilla was nice. There were no authentic flavors/spices jumping out.  \n\nIts not surprising alot of people on here like the place, the food is bland and predictable, it is very Americanized Mexican food.\n\nFor a chain Mex restaurant, Chipolte beats this place."
2,"A good sandwich, but I didn't think it was the 'second comming' of subs like some think.  As it is 'take out', no bathroom - not a big deal but inconvenient if traveling like we were.  Convenience store next door."
3,I could not believe that when you get a portion this huge that the quality could match. A truly awesome diner!!
4,"I went here for my 26th birthday and had a great experience. \n\nWhen we pulled up to the restaurant, I noticed the location was familiar. Ironically enough this place was previously a Mexican restaurant, where I didn't have a very good experience. Needless to say the past is in the past. :)\n\nThe ambience is very peaceful and the staff were quite friendly and attentive. \n\nThe pasta I ordered was incredible and indulgent - house made spinach pasta with chicken and mushrooms in a white wine cream and parley sauce. Perfection. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered Bolognese with no cheese and his request was successfully. He sometimes has a difficult time at Madison restaurants when requesting no cheese, so we always get a little too excited when places get his order right. :)\n\nI'd definitely go back and recommend that others try. \n\nThe price point and quality of good will not disappoint!"
1,"I was so psyched to do the mega-tour package which would've taken me down to the south rim via plane and a helicopter view of the rim.  Unfortunately weather had another idea as snow came down and they had to cancel the trip.  \n\nThe thing that gets me upset is that they could've called to let you know what happened before they make you wake up at 5AM and then take a bus ride all around Las Vegas to pick up other people....only to have a representative call each person up one-by-one to tell you your trip is cancelled. Then you have to wait for them to finish telling everyone and rescheduling people to have the shuttle bring you back to the hotel some 4 hours later.\n\nWe ended up rescheduling to try again the next day due to the weather and chose to drive ourselves this time.  The flight time was suppose to be 8AM and they like everyone to arrive by 7:15AM.  Before we left the hotel, I gave them a call to double-check to see if the tour was cancelled or not.  They chose to tell us that the tour was still on and have everyone gather there once again.  Again, they cancelled and tried to reschedule people....again, they did it one person at a time.  This time, we didn't have to wait for everyone as we drove ourselves and we took off after being told it was cancelled....again.\n\nFor such an expensive package and great reviews, I really expected the administrative/customer service to be a little better.  Rather than have people waste their time and sleep....it would be nice if they handled cancellations due to weather better.  There were multiple ways they could've saved time and streamlined the process even if they had to wait until the very last minute to cancel....and they didn't.\n\nThere wasn't suppose to be snow at the time I booked the reservation, but next time (if there is one), I'd make sure there's nothing but sunny skies for two weeks...just to be sure."
4,"Mesmerized! \n We decided to come here since the place we wanted to check out at the Bellagio had closed. And of course, Piero's never lets down. \n We started with apps, and went all the way! \n Calamari: Fried to perfection. Marinara sauce on the side was good, but a bit overpowering for the tiny morsels. \n BB-Q Shrimp with a spicy sauce: Though not a shrimp fan, these things were cooked just right and had a kick ass sauce to drench bread in! I thoroughly enjoyed. \n Maui Onion and Anchovy Salad with Tomatoes: I can't stand raw tomatoes whatsoever, but I had to give 'em a chance, and this salad was delish. The white anchovies and sweet onions paired perfectly with the diced tomatoes. The tomatoes almost seemd slightly cookedm they didn't seem raw at all! \n Veal Saltimbocca: 5 stars! The veal, wrapped in sage and prosciutto were sauteed perfectly, and the prosciutto was very generous, not just some skimpy piece most places give. And the Garlic Mashed potatoes were silky and velvety, and stayed this way the entire meal. Most places they get hard due to excess butter and the like. \n Desserts: Chocolate cake, creme brulee, and tiramisu. All looked fantastic, though I didn't try. \n Their espresso I had was prepared perfectly though.\n Piero's really exemplifies what a true fine dining restaurant is really about. From start to finish, it's always flawless. The staff: friendly and not pushy or overbearing. \n Yes, it's not all fancy n bling bling. But it's 'ol skool, Vegas style. \n This place sets the bar for others to follow!"
1,"Portions are small and over-priced but food was ok and prepared fast. They have an ok selection of wine and a patio area that faces a parking lot.   I ordered their pasta w/ meatballs and my husband ordered an over-priced 1/2 sandwich and small ceasar salad that was pretty good. Over all, the food tasted like Fazoli's."
3,"Review is for the Happy Hour.\n\nWe were walking by and saw the happy hour sign. $3 Skyy cocktails...why yes thank you, I'll take 12! We sat at the bar, watched some football, talked to some cool people, and drank alot of $3 Skyy cocktails. While Skyy is not my usual vodka of choice, the $3 cocktails were cheap and strong...a great combination for a night in Vegas. The bartender was awesome and kept those cheap strong drinks flowing. This is a great spot to watch a game."
0,Very dissatisfied with this hospital. I would never take myself or my family here again. The hospital is old and very dirty! Rude staff.
4,"Awesome, awesome show!  One of my top favorite shows in Vegas at this point.  I never saw the first one but thought I knew what it was all about.  But it was more than just a bunch of people banging away at random objects to make music.\n\nI particularly appreciated the comic relief and sidelines.  And the beauty of it was that nobody really talks!  You know you've got some pretty talented folks when they can tell a story without saying a word!\n\nThe music was contagious, and the actors really bring the audience in with their performance.  You never quite know what they're going to do next.\n\nDefinitely, definitely would recommend this for anyone to see.  All the Cirque shows in town are great, but get a little monotonous.  This is a great, very original show that made me smile the whole way through.\n\nWARNING:  Sitting in the front 2 rows or the extreme left or right of the first 5 rows or so can be hazardous to your wardobe!  Dust from the stage floor that they use to help make the sounds can kind of waft out into the first few rows, and there are side stages to the left and right.  It's great to sit in these spots, but just be in good humor about it!"
4,"Yelp once again helps me find another great place to check out...too bad the show is over. Yeah, that's right...the show after several years is no longer running.\n\nThis show was great, but to be honest, I really didn't know what to expect from 4 \""white guys from down under.\"" I will say though, after a few minutes they go the whole audience on their feet, clapping their hands, and signing along. This is by far one of the best shows I've seen, and with family living there, I've seen my fair share.\n\nTo my four Aussies, that's for a great show, and I wish you all the best of luck in whatever it is that you are doing now."
3,"For my birthday my fiance and I decided to check out The Cheesecake Factory and we had a wonderful experience from the time we arrived! I knew from reading other yelpers reviews to expect a wait so I was totally prepared for waiting and to my pleasant surprise our quoted wait time of 15 minutes went by fast while we looked over there enormous menu. The time finally arrived for us to be seated (patio) and our waitress Emily was very friendly and also very knowledgeable of the menu. Upon her suggestion I ordered the Jamaican Pepper Shrimp and Chicken with black beans, rice, and fried plantains. All of which was delicious. My only complaint would be the temperature of my was not very hot. My guy had the rib eye and fries and he devoured Evey bite! I ordered the 30th Anniversary cheesecake to go because my entree was sooo big but that's a good thing. You guys helped make my day that much more special and we will definitely be back!"
1,"I know I'm picky & expect too much sometimes. Maybe I didn't try the right thing here. I had the grilled cheese. It was alright, not great, but okay.\n\nThe coffee was watery. The floors were disgusting (well it was carpet!) and the service was awful. When I tried to order food from who I thought our server was she stared at me as if she was having a conniption fit and she scared me.\n\nI hate it when they send 4 different people to a table and you don't know who's who, it's so confusing."
2,"Nice Place,clean, Good Locations"
2,"I can see why they have a great rating. I had a gyros platter. They really piled it on. Great flavor , clean, friendly reasonable prices. I like my meat a bit more well done and will ask for that next time."
0,I hate to do this because I don't want to be negative but the service is terrible.  Late and inconsistent frequently.  I understand mistakes but not repeatedly.  Sorry.  :(  If you want to gamble on timeliness and quality service then these are your guys.  Caution!
1,"We were from out of town one Sunday in Phoenix when my mini-Schnauzer went critical. We had Max stay there overnight, for observation and monitoring of his blood levels (he had abdominal bleeding). The front staff, vet techs and the vet-on-duty were ok but seemed less compassionate and not as \""warm\"" as I had gotten accustomed to dealing with at our vet's clinic. First off, off the three proposed plans of care that they came up with, the vet tech decided to show me the MOST expensive option, which discussed splenectomy (mind you, we were still waiting til the blood levels were stabilized and the bleeding had stopped so ultrasounds could be taken in the MORNING, so nobody really knew whether removing any internal organ was the thing to do). Then, the cost that was quoted to us was around $5,000+! )-: I had gone through a similar situation with our other dog not too long ago and we didn't get a cost estimate that high, and yes my other dog had splenectomy, in San Diego CA (which I would assume would have been more expensive).\n This place didn't strike me as anything fancy or elegant but I realize this place could get very busy especially at night. I was already stressing over my sick puppy, and felt even sadder and more anxious when other people had brought in their injured dogs (one dog was run over, another had bloat, a kitty was I'll...). Through it all, I never did get any vet tech or staff member periodically come out and check up on us while we agonizingly waited for anyone to give us an update on our baby. I didn't feel that the staff really had my dog's best interest at heart, although they were very fast and efficient about handing me my hospital fees for the night for me to pay upfront ($1000+)?!\nI reluctantly left my baby there for the night as I felt that I didn't have much choice in such a critical situation. But after an hour of being back at our hotel I started calling the hospital every 1-2 hours to get updates. And maybe I was being more sensitive than usual, but each time I would call to request updates, the staff on the other end of the line sounded so nonchalant as she reported Max's PCV levels (as if she was just talking to me about something mundane and nothing critical at all )-:  \nI did give this place 2 stars because they were the only 24-hour vet on board facility available to us when we needed one.\nHonestly the overall vibe I got about this place was that it was just a great money-making business, and even if they did care about the animals' welfare, that came secondary only. \nIf anyone had suggestions for other 24/7 emergency vet facilities please post here! You will help a lot of pet parents I am sure."
1,"Decor was nice, but that was about the extent of it. Risotto was undercooked, mussels came with a sweet tomato sauce (wtf?) osso bucco over done and the polenta was over done. Basically, a nice sounding menu delivered incredibly poorly by inexperienced young chefs. They did get my vodka soda right."
1,"As an Arizona native, I have been going to the Improv for years.  I'm sorry to say that although it showcases some big names, the talent and atmosphere has really gone downhill.   Despite the increase in comedy theatres in the East Valley, the Improv has not decreased their prices or upgraded the experience.  I can go to three other comedy clubs in the area for $5-10 cheaper, and LMAO... which is the point!  The last show I went to, I spent premium pricing to see David Spade, and I have to say it was joke. The show started about 30 minutes late and he appeared to be pretty intoxicated.   It wasn't funny at all.  After that debacle, I held off on the Improv for a while and just hit up the other comedy clubs when I needed a laugh.  We decided to give the Improv another shot on Friday, because we really wanted to see Michael McDonald.  I have nothing bad to say about any of the acts, unfortunately I couldn't enjoy them because I was trying to make my way through the worst Martini I've ever had... (cucumber). On top of it being awful, it was $12 (Of course there was no pricing listed). What a rip-off!  The terrible Martini was not the worst of it, we were forced to share a table with another couple... okay not so bad, except they had us all packed in like sardines. The whole set up was ridiculous.  No one's chairs were actually facing the stage. I had so much back pain from having to twist around to see the comics,( because there was not enough room to move my chair) that I just wanted the show to end so I could leave.  To make matters worse, when we did leave, we realized that a large number of tables were actually left empty... so I went through all that discomfort for nothing!  Big Boo for the Improv.... Save your money and go somewhere else!"
1,"Short, somewhat rude, bartender.  Closes early. And seemed quite drab even when it was open."
4,"And my mates are all there trying to calm me down\n'Cause I'm shouting your name all over town\nI'm swearing if I go there now\nI can change her mind, turn it all around at...MICHAEL MINA! - The Script (nothing)\n\nIf you follow my reviews, you know I am a big fan of chef Michael Mina (looking forward to his new restaurant at the new stadium). When I ate here a year ago, I knew I would eventually be back. I'm just surprised it took me this long to commit (cough)...but alas, I came back like I promised for that lobster pot pie! I even specifically asked when I made reservations if it was available that evening :) \n\nWe ordered the full serving courses, not the tasting menu portions. (as shown in the pictures) \n\n1. Lobster pot pie - served table side with huge chunks of lobster (2.5 lbs worth); they carve the top crust off the pot pie and put it at the bottom of the plate to serve as the base, and then they put all the vegetables and lobster pieces on top of the crust, so its like an open face pot pie - one of a kind experience\n2. Chilean sea bass - what you would expect from a fine dining restaurant\n3. Wagyu ribeye - simple cooked well, no complaints, option to add foie gras\n4. desert sampler - i just remember the three desserts were sweet but not too sweet\n(reminds me of someone that i know...LOL)\n\nWe came after the show and even though they close at 10, we were able to order at like 930-945 and stay till 1130ish. I'm habitually one of the last ones out on many occasions so cheers for being so accommodating and friendly!"
3,"This was a great, although small, aquarium. The whole theme behind Shark Reef is that it is the only aquarium based around predators. The sharks and sawfish were fantastic. The pacific octopus and jellyfish were also very cool. The best part of the aquarium was in the same room as the jellyfish. It was a shallow touch pool where everyone can touch stingrays and horseshoe crabs. I've touched stingrays before, but never a horseshoe crab, so this was a new experience for me.\nMy only problem with this aquarium was the reptile exhibit. For some reason they had three large reptiles on the way in. These were a crocodile, a Komodo Dragon and a Water Monitor. The Komodo had mites pretty bad and the water monitor looked very sickly and never opened its eyes or moved while we were there. \nAll in all it was great, we spent over an hour there and went through the whole thing twice."
2,"I'll start with what I love about Uncle Al's. The fries. They are pretty damn good, some of the best I've had in town. Fresh cut, hot, ample. \n\nAlso great is the service and the fact that they have ice cold root beer on tap. You walk into the place and are instantly greeted. If someone isn't up front, someone from the grill will yell, \""hello.\"" And root beer on tap...I can never bring myself to pass that up.\n\nSo we get to the dogs. I am a TOTAL hot dog snob and junkie. I love tubed meat, in most forms. I even own a hot dog griller. I seek out dog places everywhere I travel. Anyway, I was thrilled to find that a hot dog place resided in my neighborhood. Then I got there. The hot dogs themselves are good. However they are not very authentic in their presentation. If you've read my reviews, you know authenticity is a big plus for me. \n\nMy boyfriend opted for a Chicago dog, which came out on a plain bun and was dressed with regular relish. Tisk, tisk. I ordered a slaw dog, which was OK. I know a true purist would order a dog \""naked,\"" but I was hungry and wanted a little something extra. I digress..."
1,Putting a young inexperienced barfly like Ashley on Sat night karaoke is a waste of time and resources.
4,"Finally!  Fabulous bagels and coffee in Lake Wylie!\n\nI'm giving 5 stars for the absolute best bagels I've had outside of NY State, as well as yummy cappuccino and super-friendly and fast service (they even have a drive-thru!).  And the prices are very reasonable, considering the quality of their product.\n\nThey also offer different delicious pastries and other sweets daily (which I'm embarrassed to admit, I've tried too many), as well as frozen yogurt.\n\nI would go out of my way for their bagels and coffee, but I'm glad I don't have to."
3,"This place is a must for tourist and locals alike!  The Fireside Lounge is ideal for playing kissy face on a date night.  If you are bringing the family, then eat in the main dining room.\n\nGreat late night dining!"
1,pretty mediocre place.   when you go to a steak place shouldn't the steak be even close to how you ordered it.  not to mention how my wife felt after about two hours. the service was fair to good.
1,While the company was awesome the food and service was far less memorable. The servers were uptight and stilted. The brunch fair was quite limited and while prepared with a chef's flare lacked that breakfasty feel you look for with brunch. Would not go back again for brunch.
1,"Use to always take my shoes here for repair...I am a cocktail waitress so my shoes are very important to me...took my shoes in for a complete overhaul...new bottoms, reconstruction of inner soles and some stitching in one area where I had a safety pin holding it...picked them up, paid the $75...go to work... I can't get the ankle strap around my ankle... Confused because I never had them work on the ankle strap...I looked and it had been sliced in half (presumably in error) and sown together mints one and one half if an inch...so can't wear my shoes at work! Go back to Shoe Repair and show them this..no I'm sorry... Just, \""we'll how long do u want the strap??\"" I stated as long as the other one..the length it originally was...no explanation or sorry for the inconvenience of me driving up there again...so leave the shoes for 2 more days...pick them up...no charge...and they still feel horrible...I'm looking at them like, what is wrong?? Then I notice on the same shoe the T strap and been cut down by an inch so the shoe fit weird...upon showing them this and asking why they even touched this the daughter of the owner argued with me that because of the \""safety pin\"" I had on it they had to do \""something different\"". I then stated that no, the safety pin was on the other foot and that shoe looks great... She argued again no, it was the other one.. I said enough, I walked around for 2 months with that safety pin, I definitely remember what shoe it was...anyway I said \"" please fix it \"" I come back another 2 days later...it's not ready... Can u wait 35 minutes until he gets back from lunch?? I'm steaming at this point...I left, came back in 45 minutes... Got the shoes...well, they fit now however my left shoe is full of butchered straps with pieces patched on it...use to always use this place...NEVER again.... All their mistakes, not one apology....BIG mistake..."
3,"This location is in a scary neighborhood.\n\nBut, the inside was renovated with McD's new interior design.  So it looks nice and well kept up thus far.\n\nThe cashier I got tried to charge me for using my Living Social deal. He said it was just $1 off, when in fact the LS deal was prepaid for already.  I told him to ask his manager and she would correct him, which she did.\n\nFries were good.  \n\nI likely will return to this location, but maybe not at night."
4,"Great breakfast at a great price!\n\nWe tried Mr. Mamas today for breakfast based on other favorable Yelp reviews. We liked it! Julie our waitress was pleasant and accommodating. Nick the owner gets around to all the tables to check in with them and he too was very pleasant. \n\nWe had the Cali Omelet. Very good. We tried the home fries. Just okay. We'll be trying the hash browns next time. \n\nWe also sampled the sausage gravy and the chili. Both yummy. We'll be back!\n\nUPDATE - 11/14/2013\nWe're back!  Today we had the Chili Cheese Omelet and hash browns. The omelet was very good, though we favor the Cali Omelet a bit more. The hash browns were very good. We much preferred them over the home fries. Claudia was our waitress and she was just as attentive to our needs as Julie was yesterday. \n\nNick was his usual cheery self. Very warm and welcoming. We REALLY like this place. We'll come back next time we're in Vegas!"
4,Just had an amazing lunch! Added chicken to the Arcadia Salad. Highly recommend!!
0,"Feedback is useless unless it is heeded.  Your comments were fairly accurate-sort of...  The doctor was in our room a total of 2 minutes.  She never talked to me about where I got Lyric from or from whom.   There is no way the doctor came out to talk to me again, that us just a fairytale.  I didn't mean for the remarks to be hurtful, just to enlighten people to check around closer to home as you certainly were no bargain to go out of my way for. JMHO."
1,"Food was good and customer service, just a bit over priced."
3,"Excellent NY style pizza!!!  The wings are great too!!!  The place is spotless and the manager (Eric) has the place running like a fine-tuned machine.  Not the best area, but worth the trip!!!"
3,"I went here after hearing about it on a tour. I didn't eat anything but had a drink, so my review will be mainly on the atmosphere and service. \n\nIt's dark and intimate, i can see it getting very loud with too many people, but when I went, it was the right level of business. Service was fast and personable, the bar tender taking time to have a small conversation. Overall, great spot. Nothing too special, but I'd happily go again!"
3,"First off, Three Villages is tucked away in the corner on the second floor of that Pacific Center/ Asian center with Bazic and Hue Thai -- near the \""Massage\"" place. I've never had Northern style Chinese so I'm really glad I had the opportunity to try it. \n\nI ordered their steamed pork dumplings, no need to poke holes, possibly losing its contents, or any of that nonsense. Just gave it a little sauna bath in the vinegar/soy sauce for a few seconds to cool off and bada-bing you can down that sucker. Also, enjoyed the beef roll, slices of been wrapped in a thin tortilla like scallion pan cake. Lastly we ordered the Shanghai style noodle, slightly larger than chow mein with pieces of pork and napa cabbage. Overall great, warm food for 2 carbivores on a chilly day. While I'm not dying to return, I'm gonna go back when I need more yummy soup dumplings in my life. \n\nAccording to the homie Tony T., the place has changed hands several times and as a result the quality has suffered. I couldn't really tell as I don't have a previous experience to use as a reference point and enjoyed the food, place was clean and service was prompt and on point."
0,Sitting in fun atmosphere but 20 min to make a shake is not a reason to come back.  It's now 255 and I walked In at 230 for a muscle freak and there aren't a lot of people  here. Some people are getting their foods before me as they ordered AFTER ME. it's bad customer service :( not coming back as quick as I thought I would.
3,"This dollar store is a cute lil gem tucked in the back of the Fry's Shopping center.  I just moved into this neighborhood last week so I stopped in on part of my 'get to know the area' walking tour.  Lemme just tell you... this place has great deals!  And ex... Rubbermade tupperware that would cost $$ at any other store is only $1 here.  Picture frames that run you $5 and up at other stores are only $1 here.  I also got a silicon rubber spatula for only $1.  \n\nThis store isn't good for all of your needs but it's fun to browse for cheap holiday decorations, party supplies, kitchen gadgets, and more. \n\nSee ya there!"
1,Service is slow in the bar area. Not many people here either.  Bartender more interested in her phone. 40 min wait for two salads.
1,"So i've never been here before and wanted to try the sushi.  i got an Omakase deluxe sushi combination, which was one of Kabuki's recommended dishes.  It wuz NOT VERY GOOD!  The spicy tuna roll was extremely sloppy and the fish was not very fresh in any way, shape, or smell.  The next day I ate at Pacific Seafood Buffet and the fish was better there.... and lunch buffet is only $8.39 or so.  I used the yellowtail nigiri from there to compare the fish and I wanna say that the buffet's fish was actually more palatable.   If  that's the fish they're serving, the prices really need to reflect the quality.  This is one of those places that you should probaly only get the rolls at because the sauces and other crap cover up the actual taste of the fish.  \n\nI will admit their hot food is pretty good... I'd give that 4 stars...  and it seems they have a very extensive cocktail, sake, and shochu menu.  The service was good, even though we had a 2 year old eating rice and miso with his bare hands (thus throwing rice grains all over the place).\n\nSummary:\n1. crappy nigiri and sashimi\n2. decent hot foods\n3. good service for families"
3,"I have ordered from here a few times already. The beef lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, and rice is good.\nI would give it 5 stars but I really like pot stickers and theirs are not so great. I ate one and threw away the rest. Their crab puffs are alright, very cute but taste wise is okay. \nI will continue to go here because the ladies up front are very nice and it's fast."
4,"Hotel grounds are impeccably kept and the attention to detail doesn't stop there. \n\nThe lobby and rooms are just as nice with the rooms being clean and enjoyable. I think if I were to have one complaint, the food wasn't up to the usual Fairmont standard. Albeit, I was attending a conference and all the food was catered, but it could have been better. \n\nOther than that- this is a very good example of a high end resort and should be given a shot."
4,I like it a lot. pastor and  carne Asada  burritos are bomb.
3,"This is a great hotel. It caters to the local clientele but as an upscale option (most local casinos are on the side of 'dive casinos.'\n\nIt has a very modern feel and is comparable to Cosmo or Aria in that way. However, it's not nearly as large as the other casinos.\n\nIf you can get over the location (it's far from the strip) and the relatively sleepy feel of the place, it may be the perfect casino. It's never crowded, service has always been good to me, and there's a 15 dollar lunch buffet that includes alcohol on weekdays. And this buffet is no joke, it's actually a really good buffet."
4,Love Tuna Tuesdays!!
3,"A tad bit overpriced, but the kids loved it.\nVery educational experience for kids and adults. The movie was in 3D and a great part of the experience."
1,Not the fastest. Feels like they need 2 more staff each shift. Parking lot/drive thru is a mess.
1,"Disappointing. I had high expectations from the reviews and appearance.  Lack of variety and originality.  Great if you like marsala sauce, pre-fab foodservice generics and breaded everything.  The red sauce/marinara was the only thing I could say something good about, but I'd bet it too came out of a can or jar.  Definately NOT worth the money and I hope to never go back."
1,"I love Panera Bread so much that I frequent all of the different locations in the Vegas area. This location is the absolute WORST! I went for (most likely) the last time last night. I went in for a takeout salad. The employees were not friendly and looked a bit \""out of it.\"" \n\nThe girl who took my order never smiled and seemed to be \""chained\"" to the cash register. While she was attempting to take the order of the woman in front of me, a kid came up and asked for a takeout box. Instead of finishing the order, she stops the customer mid-order and walks away to get a takeout box. \n\nWhen it's finally my turn to order, I ask for a little extra salad dressing on my chopped chicken cobb with avocado salad. She tried to charge me almost $1 EXTRA for dressing. What? I've never had a Panera attempt this extra upcharge before. I mean, I asked for no eggs on my salad so you'd think they could toss in a spoonful of extra dressing for free. \n\nAs I waited for my order, I kept hearing the kitchen yelling about being out of this and out of that (bread, sauces, etc). Luckily they weren't out of any ingredients in my salad. I grabbed my takeout bag and headed for home. \n\nOnce I started to eat my $10 overpriced takeout salad, I was so disappointed. First, the portion size was super tiny. There was a good amount of chicken but hardly any blue cheese, lettuce or avocado (I'd say the kitchen was attempting to hide the fact that a miniscule amount of avocado was on my salad -- it was about 2 small slices that were chopped into 5 pieces each to make it look like there was more). I eat this salad at least once a week (no joke) and most Panera locations add at least 4 or 5 FULL slices of avocado. \n\nAnd as if to sum up this experience, the whole grain baguette portion in the bag was totally burned on the bottom (see photo). \n\nPanera is a good chain restaurant but this location is horrible. You can do much better than wasting your money here. I hope the corporate office can address some of the problems here. All you have to do is take a look at the Yelp reviews and you'll see the common themes and problems."
2,"Food wasn't anything special, and no diaper changing stations in the bathrooms. The staff is very friendly though."
3,i had not been inside a Chuck E Cheese for evvverrr until just a few days ago and geez it sure has changed since i was a kid!  Kids go bonkers in this place and they do a really good job of making the kids feel special and all that jazz. They have the table sections for each party and do a group birthday celebration when chuck e comes out. The birthday kids also get to go into a wind blower and try to catch a bunch of tickets.. my friends son got the $1000 ticket (only one in there) and he freaked out haha! Good place for the young kids for sure and a decently priced place to throw a bday bash so you don't break the bank.
4,My wife and I have been seeing Dr Christiansen ever since we moved to Henderson more than 5 years ago. We have nothing but praise for his professionalism and the way he runs his business. He is also very personable and easy to talk to. He recently moved to his current premises on Jeffreys and bought with him all this great staff. I highly recommend Dr. Christensen for anyone looking for a dentist in Henderson area
2,"This is Fish n Chips with a Mexican flair.  Not sure what all the hype is about, though, if you like Fish n Chips, it's decent.  I just prefer the British version better."
4,"As Good an Experience as a Dentist Visit Can Be! I moved to Vegas almost two years ago, and have been driving back to California every six months for my dental cleanings. I had the same dentist for thirty years, so I was prolonging the separation anxiety. Figuring that I'm here to stay, I sought a dentist close to my house. Good Yelp reviews, and a great Yelp discount offer made me give Cherrington Dental a try. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and professional. The office/exam rooms were clean with modern equipment. Waiting area was nice, too. My hygienist was friendly and did a thorough job, with relatively little discomfort. Dr. Cherrington came in and introduced himself while also welcoming me to his practice. Seemed like a nice guy. The prices were reasonable, even better with my Yelp deal, and my payment was done quickly. They gave me a cool welcome gift-bag, and I scheduled for another cleaning six months in the future."
3,"I really enjoy this place. Brought some co workers in for dinner on a Wednesday evening.\nWe were seated asap and sat in front of the large flat screens and counter where you can place bets.\n\nWe watched  baseball and started off with the BBQ shrimp appetizer along with cold beers. For my entree,  I went with the oyster Po Boy which was tasty and came with fries that were just OK. \n\nFor dessert also and I chose the Banana cream pie - Graham cracker crust, caramel sauce, chocolate shavings and fresh whipped cream. The pie was definitely the highlight of the evening with the shrimp appetizer second. \n\nMy co workers enjoyed the evening and the layout of this massive sports bar. The patio is cool BC its facing the strip and even has pool tables you can rent.\n\nPrices here tend to be on the higher side but then again Lagasse's Stadium is one of the best sports bar I've visited."
1,"Just because the server will take back a poorly mixed drink or charred beans doesn't make it a good place to eat and drink.  The food at Hula's needs to be good and consistent, not just returnable.\n\nOn a Saturday night, four of us hit Hula's at 6pm.  What's so striking when you enter is how open the bar and dining room are to the patio, which needs a few more tables and chairs, I'd say.  Central Phoenix enthusiasts love a good adaptive reuse project, and the one at Hula's, especially because of the preservation of the impressive and large hexagonal window, puts it in the same category as Postino Central and St. Francis as far as an amateur's view of architectural renovations.\n\nWe started by sharing the sweet potato fries, which are on-par with Maizie's and even those at Delux.  They were crisp, evenly cut, and intensely creamy and sweet.\n\nAfter this, though, it was downhill.  Though my companions enjoyed their drinks, my Zombie, served in a tall opaque glass with a mustachioed character who looked a lot like me, was poorly mixed, lacking lime juice, and faintly soap-tasting.  The server gave me a couple minutes to weigh the drink's future, and after agreeing to suffer through it, I changed my mind and sent it back.  (The Zombie would later still appear on the bill.)  The Dark & Stormy I ordered in its place, with dark rum and ginger beer, was drinkable, but inferior to the drink of the same name at St. Francis, which, for $2 more, tastes $4 better.  I think it's in the quality of the ginger beer.\n\nMy friend's fishcakes were mostly overcooked and had to be cut with a knife, like chicken.  The ceviche, though palatable, my other friend said, appeared dry and haphazardly plated with some giant tortilla chips.\n\nAs the lone veggie in the bunch, I ordered the Spicy Tofu Tacos, which come with a spicy chili sauce and a side of rice and black beans.  Though the food came out of the kitchen quickly -- 12 minutes or so -- I wish it hadn't.  The tofu, a recently unpackaged watery brick no doubt, was merely sliced, warmed (not grilled or fried or marinated over night), and dusted with chili powder; therefore, the tofu was tasteless.  The tacos were double-wrapped in flour tortillas, which created a thick, awkward mouthfeel, so I just used one of the tortillas on each of my two tacos.  But the most disappointing part of the meal was the rice and beans, which are hard to screw up.  The black beans were so badly burned in the pot that even their juices saturated the scoop of rice with their charred, charcoal (bad) smoke flavor.  I mentioned this to the server, and she later would deduct half of the plate's $11 price (though the extra Zombie remained on the ticket).\n\nWe passed on dessert and went to St. Francis and later Fez for drinks.\n\nHula's would be a great happy hour spot on the patio if it offers consistent drinks and some happy hour food specials.  Two stars for potential, and I will try once more.  As it stands now, though, an accommodating server cannot compensate for an inconsistent bartender, burned beans, and uninventive vegetarian options.\n\nnote: I am totally aware that restaurants don't have to cater to my or other people's various dietary preferences (i.e., vegetarians and vegans), and that I choose to go to these restaurants.  I just want some rice and beans to rely on."
1,"It was my very first time going to Chili's and it might just be my last time too. There are far more restaurants with better quality than this. However, it may be one of the better options at the food court inside of the Concord Mills Outlet Mall. \n\nAll the food was either just average, or below average. The tortilla soup was way over salted. The chili was just tasteless. The burgers and sandwiches were OK. I felt like it would be easy to make that. I got the sliders and they tasted like, well sliders. Nothing about the sliders wowed me. I thought the fries were good though. I'm glad the lunch special came with a soup or salad and some fries because I definitely have had better for the price it was.\n\nI guess being average isn't so bad. However Chili's average food wasn't the thing I was looking for."
4,"We just tried Courier Cafe today for lunch and it was great! I had the Banker Burger and my boyfriend had a beef quesadilla - both were exceptional, homemade quality. Their potato salad is killer! \nOur waitress and hostess were also very pleasant. We will definitely be back! :)"
3,"Just had part of my Bachelor Party there this weekend, and it was really fun. The golf was challenging, the views were nice and the grounds looked well kept. I know they are still building the area and hopefully when they get an actual club house it will have a bar/cafe cause that seemed to be the only thing missing. The best part about the place is that they allowed us to bring in our own beer, and they even gave us two drink passes, so we tipped the beer cart pretty well cause otherwise she would be making much but overall I would like to take the drive out there again and play this course again, or maybe one of the other two that they have."
2,I have been through this shopping area many times.  The big draw for me to keep coming back is Sur La Table which moved into bigger digs just after my previous visit.  This is the largest Sur La Table in the chain and it doesn't even have a training kitchen so there are enormous areas of floor space.  As you go through the shopping area the decor  and feeling of the place changes.  This may be due to the fact it was built in stages and even changed owners part of the way through.
2,"I liked the atmosphere and I definitely suggest visiting the restrooms, they are unexpected.\n\nFood wise, there were two of us and we had burgers.  Their burgers are one of those really big really thin patties.  I think they even say something about 1/3 pound of meat.  That would be 1/3 pound of meat before cooking and it is probably with 70% because they were just really thin and really well done when they were served.  The burgers were DRY.  I had no idea what people were raving about the food for.  It was not all that!  I substituted onion rings and those were mediocre at best as well.  The shakes were tasty though.\n\nA big plus is that you can bring your dog.  There were tons of dogs there on a nice spring day just chillin'.  I didn't see the fly problem that people were talking about but have to admit that I was put off by the signs that said \""do not climb on trees, fall hazard and scorpions.  SCORPIONS!???!!!  I'm am not sitting near any tree ever again and hesitate to even walk in the grass.\n\nI will probably go back at least one more time in the future and get anything but the burgers.  Hopefully they won't cook the ever living life out of my food."
1,"2 Stars and that's me being a little generous.  \n\nWe arrived here after lunch with friends that are also Yelpers.  I'm not going to speak for them, but in my opinion, Ice Monster has some work to do.  \n\nIce Monster Cafe is new and a couple of hiccups are to be expected, right?  They're new, clean, and a decent place to hang out at.  However, what's lacking is a knowledgeable staff and desserts that are worth the price that they have them at.  I had their Coffee Ice Cream, which is literally a small scoop of Blue Bunny Ice Cream.  Tasted good, but not worth the $5.95 price tag.  The biggest disappointment is the overall service.  My gf had a few questions about the items on their menu and the staff couldn't even speak to it.  They even stated that they could Google some of the items on the menu for us.  Really?  Google it??  I don't expect a new business/staff to be experts, but at least have some knowledge of what you're serving.  A few of my friends had orders that either took too long (ie. 20 minutes for boba) or were just wrong (i.e. coffee instead of tea).   \n\nOverall, not a fan, not as good as it gets, but giving them a break with an \""I've Had \nBetter\"" only because they're new.  I'm sure they will improve and I hope they do.  I look forward to reading better rated reviews and I'm willing to give them another go when that time comes.  As for now, 2 stars are all they get from me. \n\nPS:  The Check-In Offer reads \""1 Free purchase of 2 items\"".  They're speaking Yoda and really mean \""Buy 2 items and receive another 1 for free\""."
3,"As the closest movie theater to my residence, I have made this particular AMC my theater of choice.  They often have movies and show times that other theaters in and around Charlotte simply do not offer.  Maybe because of the 24 available screens, they are able to show and keep more movies in the theater, for longer periods of time.\n\nMy standard game-plan is to pick a movie that has been out a few weeks and catch it on a weekend matinee here at AMC Concord Mills.  As others have stated, you generally find the theater mostly empty and void of distractions such as teenagers, kids, and couples intent on public displays of affection in the late mornings and early afternoons.\n\nI'm a fan of the automated kiosk in which you can purchase ticks on your own without having to go to the window.  I don't know why more people don't take advantage of this, as its usually a quicker option as opposed to waiting in line.  \n\nThe concessions are standard but never below par.  The Cherry Coke is usually crisp and the popcorn is steadily popped throughout the day.  I also like the fact that they allow you to butter your own popcorn as you like at the butter and salt station.  The only down side is that the concession prices are EXTREMELY overpriced and they are always trying to get you to upgrade or spend more money on some gut and wallet-bursting deal. \n\nAll in all this is the best movie theater in the area, especially when compared to Starlight or Northlake's theater."
1,"Two and a half stars.\n\nFirst off, Shannon is right. I don't think I will ever be able to call this Spectrum Mall. I grew up a few blocks away and the entire duration of my childhood it was called Chris Town, so Chris Town it will stay. \n\nIf I were rating Chris Town of 1992, It would probably be a four or even five star establishment. I think its hey day happened just after the food court was finished, then it was downhill from there. \n\nI will stipulate, however, that there are a couple of a redeeming qualities that remain. Ok, just one. The Costco inside is very convenient and might carry a slightly different selection compared with some of the other Costco's around. \n\nThe movie theaters used to be great but just aren't anymore. \n\nWho knows if it's all beyond repair, but I really do hope not. I loved everything about this mall when I was younger. For now though, I wouldn't recommend it minus for a fast Costco run."
2,Very subpar. Dessert is good (chocolate cake and fruit tart) but the rest is meh. Kind of worried that I will get worms or sick from the tuna poke.
3,"My hunt for sheet music and music books sent me to this Sam Ash the other day.  The location is a bit bizarre, methinks.  Wouldn't the only Valley location for this make more sense in, oh I dunno, Tempe (and not some non-descript part of Glendale)??\n\nIn any event, the location was (oddly-enough) convenient for moi.  It's located in an old grocery store strip mall, all by its lonesome.  But in the middle of the day it was more hoppin than I expected.  \n\nThe customer service peeps were more than accommodating.  I had no idea what I was looking for, really, but they helped me spit it out.  \n\nThe instrument, guitar selection was wall-to-wall and went clear from the floor to the ceiling -- no space was unspoken for.  I rarely frequent music stores, but this once they were great -- would def. go back again."
0,"I can't quite figure out how these people are doing better business than Katie use to do. I went to Katie weekly for years, because she was fabulous at what she did. \n\nFirst time I returned after she sold, the shop is completely packed. Instead of telling me that there was a ridiculous wait, I sat in the lobby for 30 minutes. Then was moved to the pedi station, where I sat for an additional 30 minutes. The girl who did my pedi was horrible. I could have done a better job myself at home. \nThen I get to the mani station. The arrogant woman doing my nails has an overblown opinion of her work. When I told her that I was a faithful client of Katie, they bad mouthed her, which is unprofessional and pathetic. \nThen after being told how much better and more attractive they were, she proceeded to give me one of the worst and over priced full sets I've ever gotten."
4,Thank you for what you do for this airport. I believe the Charlotte Douglas Airport is one of the finest in the country. All the things you have put in the choice of services the music in the lobby the rocking chairs the works. Thank you so much. Sincerely
1,"This is for the dry cleaning part.\n\nA little sketchy. \nYou drop off your clothes. \nThe man gives you a receipt after you fill out your name on his part. \nHe has no clue how much a dress, a scarf, and 2 decorative pillowcases will be, so you leave. Come back when they say, give him your part of the receipt, which he keeps...everything looks clean on first check, so that's good. \nYou pay, get to your car and think, where is the receipt they usually staple to the plastic bag? I have no proof if I get home and something is wrong that I actually took it there to get cleaned. \n\nHmmm....their business model could be improved-upon...just sayin."
2,Stopped by for dessert based on reviews.  Cute little place.   We ordered a small hot fudge sundae and a small pineapple sundae.  Both were very good and service was very quick.
2,"Here is the part which took off two stars. In fact I debated about giving it only two stars. \n\nThis morning it was difficult to notice where the \""beginning\"" point was I guess because of where I parked. I just got out, and walked up onto the sidewalk. I didn't notice that the truck next to me was the \""beginning\"" where a lady was sitting in the back of the truck waiting for people to walk up. And it's early, and I'm only half awake. There is a certain protocol you are supposed to follow, and they are different at each site. They have an A week and a B week. So if I want to get produce each week, I have to go to two different sites because the site closest to me only comes every other week. \n\nSo, I did it wrong at the this particular site. I had only been there once or twice. It is very difficult sometimes to figure out who are the volunteers and who are the customers. I looked at different people who just stared at me blank so then somebody said, \""over here\"". I followed their advice and went \""over there\"". I loaded up my produce into my bags, then went to look for where to get the bread and granola I ordered. I saw a lady sitting in the back of the truck and figured out that's where I needed to go. This is when she checked my name off the list and told me to get my \""organic\"" basket over there to the left. Uh-Oh! I messed up. No big deal. I'll put the other stuff back and go get the right one. Then the bread lady told me she was sorry to say that she had given my bread to someone else. I was very nice about it and said I would take whatever one she had left even though it was not the one I had ordered. No big deal. I'm not going to have a fit over bread. \n\nWell, the volunteers at the produce stations were not so accommodating to me. When I tried to help put back the produce into the baskets, the lady was rude and told me I was giving her the produce in the wrong order. But then when I asked her if I should put certain things into certain baskets she was like, \""yeah, duh!\"" She acted very annoyed with me.\n\nThen when I went over to the organic produce station, a volunteer man began to reprimand me. My son was there as a witness to see me humiliated and embarrassed and talked down to like a child. He was telling me how I need to do it the right way from now on because I don't realize how much I mess up their system by not checking in. Next time I need to make sure I do it right. He went on at least 3 times rewording it differently each time to make sure I got his message. Finally I had to stop him and say, \""Look, I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I'm new to this location and I didn't see where I was supposed to go first.\"" I was so mad when I got to the car and realized that I had been so nice about the bread mix-up, only to be treated like an idiot at the end. I will not be buying a basket anymore on the weeks that I have to go to that location. I am even reconsidering buying from them at all. If I can find something better, I will not be back. I tried the farmer's market at Roadrunner Park, but I think it was way more expensive. I'll give it one more chance, then I'm done. I can handle everything else, but not the rude treatment. I didn't deserve that.\n\nThe produce is ok. It appears that what comes in the basket is usually the items that I find are on sale at Sprouts that week. Not as local as I was hoping for but they claim they are buying from smaller growers. I've been buying off and on for about a year. I've been pretty happy with most everything. I've never gotten anything that was spoiled. This week I don't feel like I really got a great deal for $25, here is what I got. 1 lb onions, small bag of baby carrots, small bag of green beans, romaine lettuce, 1- 4oz container blueberries, 1 small container of strawberries, 1 cantaloupe, small bunch of broccolini, some really hard small peaches, and about 3 really hard small mangos, and bunch of extremely green bananas. The conventional basket this week actually looked like the better deal. It was twice as much food for less. But I got \""organic\"", so it must be better I guess.\n\nI do hate how early in the morning I have to go. It is a real pain especially when I go to bed at 3 am. But that's my problem."
3,"When you get into this hotel, check in on Facebook. A coupon will pop up for a Buy one, get one free drink in any Paris hotel bar. Go to the rewards counter, show the screen and get the voucher. I did this two days in a row and went to the bar next to the sports book. The bartender said that if I used the video poker machines, he could keep giving me drinks as well. \n\nI haven't stayed here but will consider it for my next trip. The inside is lovely and the location is fantastic."
4,Knowledge bartender on beer  who offered great choices to go with our meal.  The burgers were perfectly cooked and tasted great.  I would love to go there again!
4,"This place never disappoints.  I don't get over to this location much, but he service was great, the food never disappoints and the deserts will leave you feeling 5 pounds heavier.\n\nIt is not always a great place to go if you are having a meeting or gathering and you desire to chat as the noise level can be high sometimes, but the food will is worth the noise level."
2,"I decided to try Dessy B's tonight because I was in the mood for a steak and didn't want to get gouged on The Strip. Dessy B's offers a discount to Yelpers who check in at the restaurant so that also influenced my dining decision.  The Dessy B story is slightly inspiring and if you choose to dine here you will find a copy of the newspaper article about the owner's feel good story on every table. The place is not for those seeking fine dining. It is very casual with a kind of dirty country feel to it. You can leave your heels at home ladies. I ordered the 16 oz. Ribeye mid-rare and it was a little on the tough side but the flavor was standard for an inexpensive steak joint.  My waitress for the evening was very attentive and pleasant. That goes a long way with this Yelper.  There was Contemporary Christian music playing in the background, not a deal breaker for me but could be a major turn off for some.  All told, with the 20% discount, my bill came to $15.86. (Water for my beverage). A 20 spot covered the meal and tip."
1,"This place used to be a purely fish and chips and it'snow developed a confused identity as an italian restaurant although they still serve fish and have a few italian dishes. Go figure. The fish and shrimp were so much better when it was only a fish and chips place that for me it was the \""it\"" place for fish and chips. Now they seem to be straight out of a box and into the deep fryer. You're better off going to the market and buying some fish sticks. On top of everything, a teenage cashier got upset because I changed my order and actually sighed and rolled his eyes at me. The place itself is depressing and the only sign of life is a t.v. hung on the wall with the volume turned loud. Sad to say this, but Italian Spoon is officially on my \""never again list\""."
1,"I've been twice now and have not had a good experience either time. First I tried the Kobe beef burger ($12) and was disappointed. The toppings were flavorful and good, but the burger itself was more medium well than the medium rare that I ordered. And then when I finished I realized I had paid $12 on a singular mediocre burger. This was over a year ago so I can't be more specific\n\nJust today, I tried the \""Shrooms\"" burger and found it utterly disgusting. In theory, all of the ingredients (brie, mustard, sauted mushrooms, and caramelized onions) are delicious. In execution, they sucked. First, my burger was dripping with oil. This was not the natural result of a nice fatty mix of ground beef but was (presumably) due to the mushrooms being sauted in copious amounts of oil. This resulted in me consuming a great deal of what I assume was canola oil considering it's lack of taste. They also used what tasted like an ultra-pasteurized creamy brie in lieu of the type of brie I prefer and call \""stinky brie.\"" The mild flavor of this brie was lost in the burger and it's primary impact was imparting it's somewhat mushy texture. This would not have been a problem if the too-large bun wasn't soaked in grease, wrapped around a burger with no crust, or topped with sauted mushrooms and caramelized onions which both provided the contrasting moutfeel of... soft vegetables. I don't know if the burger was ill-executed or ill-conceived but it lacks flavor and there is absolutely zero crunch to this burger. Each mouthful was just a somewhat bland pile of mush that left a grease trail around my mouth. \n\nUsing raw red onion and blue cheese instead would probably help the flavor and texture, but the lack of char on the bun and patty is inexcusable. The mustard was the shining star in the flavor category but do you really want the best thing you can say about a burger to be, \""Well the mustard was good?\"""
4,"Was heading back from ASU yesterday and came across a brand new Dunknin that just opened. This one is the TITS! Store is huge and has tons of space for seating. Drive-thru was packed with cars so I went inside to see the store anyway. The line was to the door but moved fast. There was someone greeting all the customers and even handing out free samples of the Frozen Cappucino! This sample was so good I decided to get one for myself. I tried the new Chicken parmesan flatbread which was very tasty! My friend got a fresh, warm bagel with cream cheese ans we also both tried the french crueller since they looked delicious!\n\nThere was a Starbucks right down the road which was dead when we passed it so it seems everyone is finally realizing that Dunkin coffee is so much better and much more inexpensive too! Atleast now I know I visit this Dunkin when heading to ASU!"
3,Fried green tomatoes is excellent. Family feast from the menu is a must. Service needs some improvements though.
4,"I loved this place. I had the prime rib, I enjoyed every bite. The service was immpacable.  Worth every penny."
1,"I have to give this place only two stars because no way should a cupcake cost $2.75 under any circumstance.  The reason it's not 1 star is the cupcakes are delicious.  They are undersized.  One reviewer mentioned they are the perfect size... and they are, for a six year old.  For an adult, they are small.  At $2.75 per, you should get an oversized cupcake.  Batter and frosting are not expensive.  Yeah, their rent in Ballantyne Village is probably pricey... but if that's the case... move.  I hate to use this term, but I felt their prices are a rip off for what you get.  Again: delicious cupcakes, horrible value."
2,"Crowded, as they usually are around lunch time. They were swamped and there was\na long lag between customers leaving and tables being cleaned.... but I 'm not going\nto get too picky about that.\nThe extra long wait time was a bit irksome. 15 to 20 minutes to receive our order. We should have went through the drive through.\nMy burger ( a 3by3, animal style) was satisfying. My lunch companion was satisfied as well, so I know we 'll be back. Maybe just not at this location."
1,"This location has good food, however, unless you plan to spend the entire evening waiting, ordering, eating and paying for dinner you might want to go someplace else.  The interior seating area is VERY loud, making it difficult to hold a decent conversation, outside seating is much better.  We've been there twice in the last month and both times the service has been extremely slow.  When you spend more time waiting to place your order, waiting for your food or waiting for the check then it took to eat the meal, well, there is a problem."
2,"Tried the vegetable, caprese crepe.  Good.  Like the vegetable more...caprese could have used more substances.  Others had the pepperoni which he said was food, like a pizza/calzone.  Did not get to try the mimosa...would have probably made the experience nicer.  Will come back w friends perhaps next time to try mimosas too.  Overall, good service.  But it just lacked a je me sais quoi."
0,this subway somehow always makes me sick. i suggest not ordering anything there and making a sandwich at home.
2,"All I can say is French Toast for dinner!! Holy crap it's good. Big thick pieces of french toast w/ a side of crispy bacon & cheese grits. Eddie's is a place where the locals hang out. I'll take my daughter there sometimes for dinner and you'll see the same people. It's kind of loud at times but the food is really good. I usually get breakfast for dinner, especially the french toast. The lady that greets you at the door isn't the friendliest person in the world but I'm not there to see her anyways. For some good food and to hang with the locals, Eddie's Place is the place!"
3,"i would highly recommend Jaleo if you enjoy the tapas as my friends and I do. First, the staff here is outstanding. They are knowledgable, fun, patient (we had a large group), and overall extremely professional. Next, the food is great with a menu ranging from what you would expect prepared extremely well to some unique offerings. Finally, the atmosphere is lively - fun and popping."
4,"We love this Dillard's!  All of the departments that we frequent have awesome personnel that consistently greet us and take good care of us (men's, big and tall. juniors, women's, kids, shoes, housewares, lingerie).  Returns are quite simple as long as you pay attention to timeframes (some clearance items have a 3-day limit).  Throughout the year they have big sales that allow an additional 30-40% off already marked down items.  Can't beat it!"
1,"I took a friend that grew up in Miami there last weekend.  She loved it, said it reminded her of home.  She said the Cuban bread was just French bread and not the real thing.  The beans and rice were delicious as were the maduros but they were a little too greasy for my liking.  I soaked off the grease with my napkin.  The atmosphere was lacking, it did feel like I was in someone's house and intruding at times.  The TV was so loud it was ridiculous.  Is this a restaurant or what?  The server was horrible.  She was eating while we were eating and never came up to ask us if we needed anything.  I felt myself staring her down to try and get her attention to order a beverage and more napkins.  It felt a little dirty in there too, I understand it's older and outdated but it can still use a good cleaning.  \nThe food was mediocre, I'd probably go again because there aren't many Cuban restaruants but I'll probably order to-go and I'll know what to expect, for the price, it's good.\nOh by the way....you can't charge the tip...they only take cash!  She was lucky I had cash on me or she wasn't going to get a tip, not that she deserved one anyway."
3,This place has a great happy hour! Lettuce wraps $6? Yes!! The BBQ spare ribs are awesome and so are the crispy green beans!! The service was great and they made sure that we got our order in during happy hour. It is a refreshing change compared to some places that seem to discourage the happy hour menu. We will definitely be back.
0,Personally if I am shopping somewhere as high end as Saks Fifth Avenue where they cater to a higher end clientele I think I deserve good customer service. I came by here today to return a shirt that I had bought recently and received major attitude by the gentleman who helped me. He treated me as though I was an inconvenience to him. I then proceeded to go upstairs to purchase some jeans and the sales guy was rude and made me feel the same way! Horrible and seriously unacceptable and I don't plan on shopping here in the future and you shouldn't either.
1,If you gona eat Mexican food on the strip. Eat at Diablos at Monte Carlo. More reasonable
2,"After walking for what seemed hours(and probably was), my family and I decided to eat here.  It's conveniently located in the Fashion Show Mall...so after a day's shopping and gambling at the nearby Venetian and Palazzo...some Italian food sounded good.\nWe went around 3PM, so it was not crowded at all.  We were immediately seated and service was prompt.  \nThe appetizer we chose which was stuffed mushrooms was quite delicious and I would order these again.\nMy dish was a Shrimp Risotto which wasn't a part of the regular menu, but a special they had.  I thought it was good, but it didn't \""wow\"" me.  I probably wouldn't order it again.\nMy mom had a Beef Tenderloin dish...and because she invariably cannot finish her meal, she offered some to me.  I found the beef to be very good, and in fact wished I had ordered that instead.\nMy brother ordered a Lobster Carbonara dish which he was disappointed with because they mistakenly did not put bacon in the dish...even though it is listed and most carbonara's should have it.  I got a bite of the lobster in it and thought it was okay.\nOverall, the meal was good and I would probably eat here again, but would try another dish.  The prices here are not too bad.  About $60 for three of us including appetizer and drinks."
1,I'll go straight price is not acceptable vs. the services!
2,"My bf and I weren't a fan of this place. It's very loud and small inside. I ordered a mushroom and cheese omelette, bacon and a biscuit. Bf ordered a spanish omelet with salsa and home fries.\nMy omelette wasn't seasoned at all and lacked flavor. The bacon and biscuit were great tho. The bf liked his meal. The one thing we both agreed on was that the coffee was awful!!"
1,this was my first experience with the conveyor belt type sushi. The sushi was not good at all. poor quality and tasteless. prices were very cheap which is probably why it was not tasty...
1,"Used to come here with an exboyfriend when it was under a different owner. Back then, it was our \""go-to\"" Indian takeout place.  Nothing made me happier than grabbing takeout on the way home and we could settle in for a relaxing night in of food coma and great television.  Sadly, much like that relationship, all good things eventually come to an end.  In this case, the new restaurant is okay but not great.  The to-go orders tend to get mixed up,  (Chicken Korma instead of Chicken Tikki given), but my biggest gripe is that the naan is not nearly as good as it once was.  Naan is now overly chewy and doughy.  Maybe its been the few times I've come in, but when the naan isn't great, it breaks my heart.  Oh and the spiciness factor seems to be off.  i.e. its either way spicy, or way bland."
3,"Think of it as an amuse-bouche of Vegas\nshows. Beautiful and fun to watch. My flame and I just happened upon the falls when we stopped for drinks at Parasol Down. The forest and bright white waterfall and \""lake\"" are gorgeous to relax by and sip a beverage. The following night we came by for more drinks, this time we stopped at the small bar that is located above Parasol Down. Great bartender, cozy couches and oh! A cool, free show! My attention span is short. This show fit perfectly. If you're in the mood for quick entertainment...this is a great stop. We happened to be visiting during Christmas week, and the Wynn had a lot of beautiful sights to take in, including this show. It runs every half hour - different shows each time. The bartender told us the 7:30 and 9pm shows are the best. It's entertaining, and right when the convo starts to drag a little, a new show is starting."
2,"Good little place.  It had a modern interior, but felt like a mom and pop (although the 2 workers were young).  The beef is cooked when you order.  There is a wide selection of toppings/cheeses to make your burger your own.\n\nThere are only 2 people working in this establishment, so don't expect the world.  The prices aren't expensive either (for Canadian food at least)($5 for the meat, about $1 per topping).  The lemonade was quite good, wish they gave more!  They offer sweet potato fries to make them healthier, but I still prefer the normal french fry."
4,"This is a couple days late. We went on Friday night. Small cafe in The Center. I didn't know about this place before. But there is a jewel inside if this building. \nWe were cheerfully greeted by \""Ye-shay\""  (sorry don't know how to spell his name). This was our first time there. He described the items very well and even gave us some samples to try.  Food was very good. Fresh and tasty!  Loved the baked goods too!!! Cookie/brownie thing is a must have!!!  We received excellent customer service from this young gentleman!  Very nice to have him on the front line.  First impressions mean everything to a business.  My husband and I will definitely be back. We want to try everything!"
4,I have an almost three-year-old cat named Jack that I spoil as if he were my son. I honestly never experienced the love for and from an animal until I adopted Jack from an Animal Rescue League. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nThe shelter is great and I'll probably get another cat in the near future. Check this location out!
3,"Asians sure know how to pack a hotel room. \n\nWhen my grandpa and 6 year old bipolar cousin (b/c of her mind swings) from Taiwan came to visit, my aunt and uncle that it would be nice to take advantage of the Carnival Cruise offers to her (I was joking how we were cruising from LA to LV). Remember, always look for deals and never pay full price if at all possible! \n\nWe managed to fit 6 people into the Venetian Bella suite quite comfortably with two people in each of the queen size beds and two on the L shaped sofa (which has a pull out bed with bed covers already on it). \n\nThere's even three LCD HDTVs in the room (one in the bedroom, one in the business area, and one in the bathroom). There there's a separate bath and shower stall but the whole can't be used if one is taking a bath unless you want to see some of your family members naked (Nooooooooooo, I'm blinnnnnnnnd).\n\nShame that there's no free Internet ($10/day use) though you can order movies (with the adult variety cough cough) here. \n\nWhat the heck is with the $8 box of Kit Kat bars??? Are they make of gold? \n\nThe canal ride is lame unless you want to be stared at the entire time around shops that you can barely afford. If I was a lady, I would punch the guy in the face for taking me on a canal ride. \n\nTIP: Stand out on the side facing the Mirage and you will see the entire fire volcano show without a crowd every 8, 9, 10, and 11pm each night. \n\nOh, and who was the genius to have the 3rd floor parking garage be connected to the 2nd hotel floor? \n\nAt least they have guards checking if you have your keys to get into the guest area at night."
4,Great food at sick prices. Their take home pizzas are bomb
3,"The food is excellent, nice fancy but modern place to go. Out of my normal price range, but is good for a special dinner!"
2,"This is a fantastic pool for those who are training for a triathalon, or even the Commonwealth Games. Athletes. Those who can butterfly stroke in their sleep.\n\nYou might not believe me, but I am not one of them. No, instead I am one who wears her hair high in a bun on her head, still keeps her mascara on, and does a leisurely breast stroke for each length, keeping my head firmly above water.\n\nNow, I can swim. And I can do this modify breast stroke quite well. But as I run, practice yoga and hit the gym and weights often, for me swimming is my down-time, relaxation exercise. Im not doing it to train.\n\nWith that in mind, the Commonwealth pool would be my 2nd choice for pools in my area (Marchmont). It's really clean, very well kept, and the pool is of Olympic distance. So it's a wee workout for my relaxation swims.\n\nBut, and I don't know why it's called 'Pool & Sauna' - it doesn't have a sauna! Or a steam room! I *love* going for a half hour swim, then suffering through 10 minutes of intense, dry heat only to then plunge myself under a super cold shower. It feels amazing! Instead, there's just the swim, then a slightly chlorine-smelling pat down before I head home for a proper shower.\n\nAs a gym facility, I think it's pretty great. I've heard rave reviews of the classes, there's a full gym, and it'd be a great place to cross train (again, triathaletes in mind).\n\nBut for folk who want a leisurely swim and then sauna after, you might be better going elsewhere."
1,"I have got to say that my fiance and I were very disappointed with the Luxor hotel. It has such a unique exterior and cool theme. We couldn't wait to stay here. My fiance and I came to Vegas to celebrate my 21st Birthday. We couldn't wait, we had it all planned out and knew what we wanted to see and do!. Criss Angel was top on my list \""Mind freak\"" We saw him the night we arrived in Vegas. Sadly he was the biggest disappointment ever. I couldn't believe how his show just wasn't him at all. The big problem was, that it had too much filler not enough magic, there was a total of 5 or 6 tricks and left you thinking in between tricks. (to spaced out) We also had a chance to see Crazy Horse which was ok Boobs and Butt no biggie lol. We had a good time playing blackjack and enjoyed our romantic evening in are badly lit room. ( btw it could of been decorated a bit more)The dealer who was at the table we chose to sit at for my first gambling table was so sweet and understanding about how this was my first table and i was nevus lol. Davey and I won $100.00 We stopped after that lol. We also celebrated my first legal drink in -5 degree temperature at the Minus5 bar which is located at the mall attached to the Luxor, Loved it!! [IMG]http://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk153/poizonmotherfuckingivy/M5LV909233384651.jpg[/IMG] Oh almost forgot. I could of done without the annoying employees that bugged my fiance and I about vouchers every five minutes,. But Besides that had a good time and the other employees were very nice and sweet. =]"
4,"The staff have always been very friendly and outgoing in order to help me pick out my wedding dress, as well as my bridesmaid dresses.  Deb in particular has gone above and beyond for me on multiple occasions!  She is always very sweet, kind, patient and incredibly knowledgable about all the various styles, brands, and sizes at David's Bridal to help you feel like a princess on your special day!  She is simply fabulous!  I have had an incredible experience at this bridal store and I would give the highest recommendation to anyone looking to purchase wedding attire."
0,Not a good experience. Left my iced coffee in the counter without calling my name. Messed up my order. Too busy with their LOUD conversation about wanting to leave early!! No wonder this place is always empty!!
2,"We attended a horse show that was here at this facility. You find yourself never leaving the place, because it's a hassle to get to the \""Strip\"" let alone anywhere else in town. We decided since we were ostensibly stuck in this cowboy version of a higher end Holiday Inn, we dove in and tried everything they had to offer. We upgraded from a regular room to a Suite to begin with....Hmmmm. Very strange configuration. You walk through two locked doors and you are presented with one of the most poorly decorated living rooms I've seen in a while, but bonus, at the end of the room, a little office that overlooked the pool. Off to the bedroom. Certainly large enough for two, but the austerity was just strange. The bathroom was equally as awkward. There a sliding door on the toilet portion and don't push too hard, or it sounds as if a bomb went off. The shower door, circa 1950. A large tub, but no jets. It was just disappointing. The lighting was poor too. Oh well, what about the food. Well, that's pretty interesting too. We ate at all their restaurants and candidly, nothing to brag about except the cafe where an egg breakfast was $4.95. Can't really beat that. So we stayed here for one week, ate at their best restaurants every night, had wine and walked out with a $2,100.00 bill. That's really fine for Las Vegas. So if you want to stay in an okay place and not spend a fortune, South Point is tolerable.\n\nPeople who work here were really incredible. And I must say that the odds are no better here than anywhere else, though they seem to think their slots are looser. Whatever."
0,Starting with the seating. In a place that had very little people we got pushed to a small corner which in theory is nice but for service was horrid. the food was lacking to say the least. I had more flavor in my dogs food than in my burrito. also the service was less than acceptable. Our food took almost a half hour to arrive and then no one came around to check on us. the best part of the meal? leaving the restaurant.
2,"I was very hyped up about this place. I heard great things. Besides that, it's in the Bellagio so it has to be great. I will say it was good, but not great. Food was okay, selection was okay, but I must say, I expected more."
1,"Let me say the food tasted and looked great. However, beware that they use MSG in their food. If you have no sensitivity to MSG, then enjoy. However immediately after eating the food both my mom and I had horrible headaches, dizziness, and some numbness in the tongue (all documented side effects of MSG). I'm disappointed as I really wanted to have a decent Asian place on this far North side of town, but I cannot handle their food. Also, the place really needs a thorough cleaning, I understand casual atmosphere, but food crusted on the wall next to you or stains on the booths are not \""casual\"" they are dirty."
0,Terrible service.   I signed up for a three day pass online then finally got a chance to try the gym.   They told me that the pass expired and offered a one day pass.   The whole point was to try the gym at the times I go to see how crowded etc before I joined.   I'd rather take my business somewhere else if you can't allow someone to try your gym twice one time in the am and one time after work to see how busy and the accessibility to the equipment.
4,This place is so amazing!!! I always look forward to my trips to Chicago to stack up on this tasty goodness but now that it's in Vegas is amazing!!! The Chicago mix is the perfect blend of sweet and salty
1,Has Gone Out of business
2,"It was my first time here. I'll be honest, when downtown, I tend to go to what I know. But this was a business meeting, and the person I was meeting with is a fan, so I thought...what the heck. \n\nIt was lunch time, and our meeting was early. Before noon on a weekday, the place was pretty bare (that changed about 12:15). \n\nI had a lot of time to glance at the very diverse menu. As a non-meat eater, coming to a place that I was not familiar with is always a gamble. I was pleased with the extensive vegetarian and healthy-ish items. I chose to be a bad vegetarian and got the grilled cheese with a side salad. \n\nThe grilled cheese was legit. Ranks in my top 3 of local grilled cheeses. I could taste the flavors of the different cheeses and the bread was still crispy and not too oily. The entree also came with a very small espresso cup full of tomato soup. I would have liked to have a larger serving of soup, but it was very flavorful. Though with the cup size, it was difficult to dip (I don't care if it was a business meeting with someone I'd not met before. I dip my grilled cheese. I'd do it at home, in front of my grandmother, or at a business meeting. I have no shame). \n\nThe salad I got instead of fries (tried to be healthy-ish) was okay. The greens were great, but they surprised me with two different types of olives. I've not had them on a house salad before. The dressing was a bit bland. But the greens really had good flavor. \n\nI will go back and perhaps try one of their vegan dishes next time."
4,When my husband and I walked in we saw there were lots of people eating.  We decided to eat at the counter.  Our waitress Liz was very cheerful and took our order right away. The food cooking smelled so good. Our order came within 10 minutes.  Our food was delicious.  We were watching the coojs and waitresses and they were working as a tem should be.  The manager Nick was there helping out also. We were there around 12pm during the lunch shift. Our experience was good and we highly recommend this Dennys on Losee Rd.
4,The food here is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I been to a few places like this one but this is my favorite. The food is tasty and fresh and the place is very clean. The pita bread and hummus is great. I live about 40 minutes from the place but it sooooooo worth the drive.
0,"Poor service! I asked them to grill the burrito. The lady at the counter said they did not have time to grill it! I told her I wasn't in a rush. She just looked at me unapologetic and simply said \""we don't have time\"". You have lost my business, maybe that will give you some time."
0,"Wow, I feel bad for everyone who wrote glowing reviews.  They obviously have been subjected to really awful food all of their life.\n\nI got the chicken fried steak with over medium eggs and one of the muffins everyone raved about.  Everything came with enough salt to preserve my digestive organs for the afterlife.  The potatoes are cheap, frozen cubes soaked in season salt...inedible.  the gravy was also way overseasoned, might of had some potential if not for that.  The banana nut muffin was nothing to write home about and had a weird texture.\n\nThe husband got the avocado bacon omelette.  Though he is a hearty eater, two thirds of his food was left behind.  The omelette had a ton of cheese melted over top, usually a good thing, not in this case.  The cheese looked plastic like and he said it tasted microwaved.  He too had a large portion of blood pressure killing potatoes.\n\nThe kid had chocolate chip pancakes.  Nothing to write home about but apparently way better than what we got.\n\n$41 for this lousy meal.  When we paid, the lady asked how everything was and my husband replied very salty and terribly overseasoned.  She responded by giggling like a school girl and telling him the total.  Way to handle a complaint there.  A $2 egg mcmuffin beats this junk any day."
3,"We happened to walk by this place while exploring Montreal during our first visit...and the gentlemen outside really encouraged us to check it out. So we returned later for dinner and we were not disappointed! We were blown away by the delicious & authentic flavors. The spaghetti bolognese was hearty, flavorful & authentic...plentiful, very satisfying. The caprese & house salad wonderful, and you have to try the garlic bread, delish! Yes the decor is outdated, but so what! It's the food that makes this place a must try..and prices are reasonable. Staff is friendly too. We've had Italian in San Fran and Boston...now we've found a new gem that's right up there with the best!"
4,"I went here for New Year's! It was much better than usual, because Paris Hilton was there DJing. There were tons of people still trying to get in at 1 O'clock in the morning and I was one of the lucky ones. There was confetti flashing lights and tons of people ordering Dom Perignon. Many people were wearing tuxedos too. I wore a Ralph Lauren shirt with a leather jacket and Dockers and ordered Seagrams 7 Crown and 7 Up. Best New Year's ever!"
1,"Personally I didn't like the Bank nightclub, not my type of scene. First of all, I don't like the fact that they don't have a situated line outside the club. Pretty much if you wanna get in quick, you gotta either be a b*tch and shove people out of your way, or go up to the bouncer, hand him some money and talk as if you're about to conduct a top secret drug trade.\n\nAfter finally getting into the bank, I was surprised to see how small the club was. It was SO small, dark, and crowded. Don't get me wrong, the decor was nice... But that was about it. Drinks were ridiculously expensive, $12 for a single shot... come on, i know this is vegas but that's just crazy. \n\noverall, the vibe of this club was just wrong. just like kara b. mentioned,  all i heard was top 40 music with no real mixing or anything. if i wanted to listen to that, i could just turn on the radio. and i was surprised a lot of people weren't really dancing. a lot of people were just standing around as if they were millionaires trying to look cool. anyhow, i was surprised since this club is inside bellagio, which is a real nice hotel. thank god we got in free."
0,"They still struggle with how to make eggs over well.  This is not good for a place that has breakfast as a focus.  Their eggs are horrible and I was again disappointed with the lack of ability to actually make french style eggs over well, crispy on the outside,  firm and not broken yolk.  The pot of bread is good, but the lack of specialty coffee just is not enough for a place serving breakfast.   A year later and no improvement is not acceptable.  I hope to give them more stars next time because I love local egg breakfast places.  This place makes me want to stay home and cook my own food.  Woah, did I just say that?  I hate cooking."
2,"Very good traditional costume selection, with some added rave-wear that was interesting -  including a light-up headress."
2,"We had Melman bucks. So we came for dinner. Just four of us. But holy shit. They fed us like we we're three hundred pound men. Don't get me wrong. I love food. But there's enough, and there's just too much. We split a pasta as a first course. It was adequate, taste wise. But portion wise? How one person could even think of ordering it for dinner is beyond me. I would blow up. Wafer thin? I think not.\n\nWe followed with baked clams which were pretty darned good. I like to put a little finely grated lemon rind and romano in my homemade version. I tasted both in theirs. I may sue.\n\nWe moved on to a chicken saltimbucca, which was actually quite good. We followed with a salad. I could see the dissapointment in the servers face. When we only asked for espresso after, she seemed sad. \n\nI almost felt sorry for her. I guess she's used to people who live a week off the leftovers. We did, however, enjoy some very nice wine. So I think that may have made her feel a little better."
4,"your business is appreciated here!! and this is the place you want to get pampered! i've been coming here for at least 5 times in the past two months, and each time i was greeted with smile and a bottle of water, everyone was super friendly and attentive. I like to support local business like this because they treat me good, and who doesn't?! most importantly, they make my nails look sooo pretty and last long. so thanks for the good work, andy and tracy!"
2,"It's an okay coffee shop, they have wifi but didn't take advantage of it.. Kinda mellow but nothing amazing as far as ambiance goes. The mocha was decent, not spectacular. Since I live downtown I probably will go check out Cartel or Jobot if I really need my coffee fix. Both are closer and probably feel and look cleaner than this joint, they should air it out a little bit..smelt kind of ripe mixed with the coffee beans lol ..just saying!\n\n3 stars"
2,"I ordered the Phone.  As a Canadian I am appalled by how much cilantro and mint they add to the vietnamese food in the US. I dislike both. It wasn't stated on the menu so the first time my meal came out , I had to send it back. When it came out correct it was good. Not the best I've had though.  The service was okay as well."
4,"We love China Chef! I always order about 15 minutes before I want my food ready. We have one of their to go menus on the fridge so we can pick what we want and then just pick it up.  They have never messed up our order, which is important when ordering take out.  We order the dinner combos which come with a meat, delicious fried rice, and an egg roll. It's a really good value for the amount of food that you get and the taste.  I can get two filling meals out of one combo! Which is much better than the local major Chinese food chain that I can only get two meals out of if I limit how much I eat and theirs costs about the same. The quality and freshness is so much better too. I don't think I've seen a heat lamp at China Chef, but my food is always nice and hot when I pick up! I am so glad there is a restaurant like this out here in Queen Creek. There is one other chinese restaurant that I like out here and it's pretty much right across the street,  but I normally go there to sit down and eat rather than take out."
0,"I hate to say it, but I am finally done with Lo-Lo's. \n\nThe first time I ever went there it was wonderful. It was in this small house and the atmosphere and food was amazing with wonderful service. Then they moved.\n\nI work pretty close so one time a coworker and I called in a lunch take-out order. From my prior experience of them being so busy I called well ahead of time to ensure it would be ready when I got there. It wasn't. I waited an extra half an hour and was told it was my fault because I called so early. Rude.\n\nRegardless, the food was amazing and I wasn't going to let that ruin a restaurant for me. Went there once more with my boyfriend and had great food and great service. A few more times had take-out and they were all a success. \n\nThen my boyfriend and I took two of our friends there for a greasy hangover breakfast since they had never been there before. We were told the wait would be 40 mins. After an hour my boyfriend asked what had happened and they told us we missed it when we were called. Annoying but hey, maybe it was our fault and we sat back down expecting to be first in line. The hostess then came out and seated a group of like six who had gotten there way after us. Annoyed and STARVING we gave up and left. And I looked over at the hostess just livid and she looked right back at me with this smug look on her face.\n\nToday was definitely the last straw. We ordered take-out and apparently they no longer accept payment upon arrival. You have to pay with a card up front. Thankfully I work at a bank and have an ATM on campus so I could deposit the cash into my account for the $70 order we made. They said we needed the card and ID to pick up the order and I told her I was sending someone else to pick it up, the girl on the phone told me she would make an exception as long as he had those two items. And of course they told my coworker when he got there they can't do that but luckily gave him the food. The chicken was dry and tiny and the waffles were super thin. \n\nI'm just over it. Now that Welcome Chicken and Donuts opened I'll just go there instead. They always have good service and the chicken is amazing. I'm sad that such a Phoenix staple has gone so down hill."
3,I love the new setup of Carson Street Deli.  New bar seating.  More table seating.  Excellent selection of craft beers.   Excellent menu and sandwiches.  The Reuben that I had today was very good but Szmidt's Old World Deli in Greenfield is better if you are judging on the sandwich alone.
4,Alfred was our server and was spectacular! The salmon was awesome! \nSeared Tuna salad incredible!\nThe burger actually came medium full of flavor!\nAnd the fruit pancakes out of this world!
3,"Iate here on my birthday this year since I was staying at the Orleans. My friends and I bought a deluxe pizza which came out to about $18..... The pizza was great, just a bit pricey but I figured it would be since it's in a casino. It loses a star for price, but it's 24 hours and good food."
4,Great job! They honored a $15 coupon from the internet and they work Sunday. I'll be back!
1,"I've been here about 5 times total, and I am completely unimpressed. \n\nThe food is overpriced and just not worth it. I have no problem paying for a good meal, but this wasn't a good meal. I could have made what ended up on my plate from the contents of my refrigerator and it would have tasted better. \n\nThe one caveat to my \""My Florist has crappy food\"" attitude is the cinnamon scones. These are absolute heaven. Too bad I won't be back for them, as getting one means dealing with the rude staff. \n\nOut of the five visits, only once was the service decent, and I think it was only because my dining companion knew the server. That's bad. I never went in dressed like a bum or treated the staff obnoxiously, but yet the staff had no problem treating me like a second class citizen who didn't belong in the restaurant. I don't know what kind of qualifications you have to have to get decent service here, but I obviously don't have them. \n\nI won't be back ever. It's a shame, too, because it is within walking distance."
2,"Worth a try\n\nThought I didn't absolutely love it, tastes vary and - like most Mexican restaurants - Asi Es My Tierra is worth a try. Their food is good and prices are reasonable. The service was excellent."
1,"We were disappointed overall.\nTo start, we had made reservations a week prior, not really knowing what time would be best since we were from out of town. We called earlier in the day to see if our reservation could be changed to an hour later and they told us they could but there would be an extra 45min wait on top of that. We scrambled and made it to our original time. \nThroughout the night we found it odd that there were many empty tables in the restaurant yet they couldn't move us to a later reservation w/out an extra 45mins wait...\nThe service started out great, we ordered a few drinks before we put in our food order. They were served in a fair amount of time, we were not in a hurry or it could have been considered slow bar service. \nThe server was very friendly, which was the only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1.\nWe had a 4 course meal which they managed to screw up. They forgot to bring us one of our appetizers. Ok, mistakes happen, we let it go. \nMain course came out and it tasted good, fresh. But we waited an eternity for desert. From when we finished our main platter it took about 20 mins for desert to be brought out. There was a table next to us that had the same problem, they waited even a bit longer from what we noticed.\nWith so many places in Vegas that are top notch, go elsewhere so you will not be disappointed."
1,"Just OK for lots of money. Service was very good, food was nothing special. Butter was rock solid, not spreadable. I would look for another seafood restaurant before ever going back to this one."
0,"The food is really good and the prices are reasonable. The reason for the 1-star is the service which to me makes or breaks a restaurant. Firstly, I called to reserve for a party of 18 and when we got there, the table setting was only for 12. Secondly, I was the first to order out of 18 people and ordered dumplings as appetizers - those came 45 mins later. Thirdly, when we were trying to get the attention of our server (her name is Bri), she just kept ignoring us and was not accommodating at all. Finally, when we ordered a \""surprise\"" Great Wall of Chocolate for my sister's birthday, it didn't take her five minutes before she went up to my sister, told her \""you didn't tell me it was your birthday!\"" and asked her for the dessert that she would like to order - after I'd ordered something specific."
2,"Great for lunch or catering.  The sauce is tangy and not too sweet or thick.  The peach cobbler is much too sweet, but I love the pulled pork or chicken.  It's a little smokey (a little dry, but that's what the sauce is for).  It's no frills but delicious.  Plus it's inexpensive for a quick lunch."
2,"Great place for a nice lunch with good people over good conversation. The food is great, I favor the thousand bean pita on most days, their hummus selection really keeps you eating until you waddle out of there. \n\nThe Babaganoosh was not favored by a friend of mine, but I don't really care for eggplant so I wont hold it against them. \n\nCheck it out if you haven't already."
0,Very bad service. Also my girlfriend got very sick after eating here. Also notice that the chicken she had ate was undercooked. DO NOT GO TO THIS APPLEBEE's
0,"RIGHTS VIOLATION ALERT!\n\nMy wife had an appointment for a blood pregnancy test. We walk in for the appointment, and they refuse to do the test. Then they wouldn't allow me back there with her for her appointment. They  also forced her to recount events that happened several years ago, which threw her into a full-blown panic attack/PTSD attack. They still wouldn't allow me back there with her. So if you care about your loved ones at all, don't bother with this place."
0,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a food snob, but I do enjoy cooking and when I eat out, I like to order food that offers me something that I can not easily create myself.  We are new to Madison, and just the week before we ate at Tutto's down the street from Portabella's for the first time.  Tuttos is almost exactly the same price-point and we had good food, a great atmosphere, and a wonderful time.\n\nWhen I took my wife's family to Portabella's for her birthday, I was expecting something special.  The restaurant had equally good reviews for food and absolutely rave reviews for atmosphere.  When we arrived, we were promptly ushered into that room that is typically set aside for families with children (or the under-dressed).  No problems there, a little tacky, but the service was still attentive and we didn't want to ruin anyone else's romance.\n\nIn short, we were still prepared to be impressed.  We were very surprised to discover that the food was absolutely lousy.  Not just bad, cheap catered wedding banquet bad. \n\nTo give you an idea of what I mean, the chicken breast in the chicken rollatini was not properly dressed and still had bits of gristle attached.  It also had that peculiarly soft texture that comes from sitting in a steamy warmer for hours before being used.  The \""procuitto\"" in the rollatini was actually sliced smoked ham.  The walnut pesto was so oily that it began to separate on the plate and the red potatoes were a soggy pile of pepper, potato,and oil.  The entire plate was an overcooked, tasteless, and oily mess.\n\nIf the rollatini was an embarassment, the lasagna was simply careless.  It's composition was sloppy.  The noodles (all two of them) were so liquid heavy that they did not hold their texture.  The sauce was thin and ran out of the lasagne onto the plate, which made the entire dish something like a chunky soup.  The entire thing was a sloppy mess.  A personal annoyance (that doesn't necessarily indicate poor craftsmanship) was that there were chunks of meat the size of my thumbs.\n\nOur other food was similarly flawed, but it was the sangria that ruined the evening.  My wife loves sangria.  She loves it enough that she isn't particularly picky about it.  I can totally understand using cheap wine and triple sec (instead of a premium orange liqueur) for the drink.  I can even understand adding a little juice to thin it out if it's too strong.  What I cannot understand is adding water to dilute it.  Typically, if my sangria tastes a watery I assume that it's ice-melt, but this was a degree of watery that I have only tasted before when I went back to a glass sitting in the hot sun that wasn't worth drinking anymore. Our sangria was literally 1/3 water.\n\nThis is one restaurant that has either confused its catering business with it's sit down service, has gotten sloppy, or thinks that its ambiance is sterling enough to make up for lousy food.  Whatever is the case, I can't imagine ever ordering food there again."
1,"I've had multiple things repaired here when desperate. Once was a dress that just needed the unfinished hem cut, which she took on in a hurry and did a decent job with. She did fine with having jeans hemmed shorter too. Another time I gave her an expensive winter coat to have the sleeves shortened, and I got the coat back with the sleeves so short it's laughable. I don't blame her for the shoddy job as clearly I should have complained when it happened, but I definitely won't take anything back here that is expensive."
2,"$100 a head to watch the Mayweather vs. Mosley fight here with an open bar.  Located in The Miracle Mile Shops.\n\nFight was wack.  Spent about 2.5 hours here from 7PM-9:30PM when the fight ended.  Ended up paying an additional $70 for a couple servings of french fries and hot wings to go along with all the beer and alki.  The server chick we had was pretty attendant to us considering how packed this place was for the fight.  We paid $100 a head and got seats and our own server while a lot of other people paid $60 and I believe they had to go up to the bar to get their open bar drinks.  I really thought we'd all get a lot more drunk since we all threw down $100 each, but I'd say on average out of our group of 11 dudes, we probably only put down about 3 beers and a shot each.  I got a 3 beers, a shot, and 2 jack and cokes.  Could've done more, but the stomach wasn't liking me that night.  Not sure if it was the food or the previous 2 nights of drinking in Vegas.\n\nPlace is alright overall, nothing special.  Just another sports bar & grill with a bunch of TVs and server ladies dressed up like cheerleaders."
2,"Its a jamba juice, what else can i say??\n\nits a little slower here. I do prefer a Robeks over a jamba any day of the week. \n\nNothing to complain about, nothing to rave about...\n\nStandard run of the mill Jamba...i know a franchise that is uniform...weird..."
1,"This place is hillarious. It is located right near my house, in an area that seems vacant, as previously mentioned. The only reason we go here, ever, is because it is conveniently located. The brew is cheap (as it should be), and the staff is ok I guess. At one point, the female bartender challenged my friend to a chugging contest (she won). I'm pretty sure this would be a good place to pick up a hooker, if you wanted to do so. So if you would like to have some brews and play pool with low-life scumbags in a lower-rung environment, I would recommend it. Its a good laugh."
4,I love a good falafel!
4,"I think this is a great little place! I've been 2 times now and both times has been perfect. There's room for a live singer or band and is a little cramped but that's almost what's so nice about it. Especially fun for football I'm sure! Pizzas are wonderful! So are all the appetizers! There's horse racing inside and songo which is bingo with songs. Think it's Chicago based, very well done!"
3,"I cant believe I have driven by this place so many times and not stopped in. \nFirst, it used to be a diner location, so it still looks that way . I Picked up the Mahi Mahi for $10.95 and I got enough good food to last me all day. I grabbed one Katsu Musubi which with the meal was an all day serving. Service was Great. I was greeted and checkout out with a smile by a sweet women working the front. The prices for everything are good too. Next time I stop in  Im going build up the courage to try their Ramen Burger. They have enough on the menu to keep you busy, so enjoy my Hawaiian grill fanatics."
3,"What a nice place to have a special meal done with an artistic touch, served with an exotic juice, to make you feel the indulgence of the city. Orders are served particularly fast."
0,"My pool pump broke so I had them come out and install a new one which they couldn't do for like a week.  Then the tech shows up at night when it is pitch black, installs our pump by the light of his cell phone and then I find out my pump is leaking three days later.  Then they have the audacity to tell me they won't come out again for another week or so to fix it.   STAY CLEAR OF SHASTA!!"
3,"The canal is my go-to for everday running. While I have a tough time repeating the same route over and over (my fitness STOPS in the summer because I refuse to use a treadmill), I do loops using the surface streets to create a new 3-6 miler every day!"
1,"Well ,let me start by saying, I had no problem getting an appointment. I've Been here twice, neither one was with Dr. Woodson My husband once, not with Woodson either.\nMy first visit was with Nick. Great guy. He was very pleasant and obviously knew I was desperate for help & had no insurance because he went to great lengths to give me samples and coupon codes. I went in with a bad rash all over my face and was immediately deemed staff infected. There was no culture done, but a prescription for ointments and antibiotics was written and 130 dollars later I was hopeful. A week later, \nI cancelled my follow up appt two days before the set date because my face was looking cleared up and I did not have another 130 to spare on a quick peek at my progress. Well, 2 days later after all the ointments and meds ran out, there it was, back again, but worse! I quickly made an appt for the next day and this time saw a young woman Dr. She spent about one minute asking what I did for a living (for staff infection related purposes I suppose) and left the room. I wasn't feelin the love, AT ALL!  A nurse gave me some samples and I was written a new prescription for even stronger antibiotics.So another 130 dollars later & still annoyed no culture was even offered and no questions about my daily facewash routine or anything came up, I paid and hoped for the best. After 2 weeks of very strong meds and new cream samples my face was looking great. Then guess what? 2 days later my face was again flared up. I decided after the lack of attention to detail I had experienced, I was not about to give them another dime.\nI had an allergy test done and it turns out there is a chemical in all my cleaners (face wash, shampoo, laundry detergent, make up,hand soap & body wash) that I have been re acting to on and off on all parts of my body over the past 10 years. Im surprised a DERMATOLOGIST doesn't immediately discuss this chemical (which by the way is banned in the UK & Canada) with their patients. Its so simple.  Sad Dr.s today aren't educated on the toxins in our everyday toiletries .\n\nIf anyone else is having an unexplained rash/ itchy hive type issues. Don't let a dermatologist rob you blind before you do research on a chemical called \""Methylisothiazolinone\"". Google it.  Theres also a Facebook page for sufferers of this and its sister chemicals to get support!  copy and paste this link on Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Allergy-to-Isothiazolinone-Methylisothiazolinone-and-Chloroisothiazolinone/307128722674171"
4,"I think I've been to just about every Thai restaurant around the valley from Thai Spices, Salla Thai, Thai Elephant, Thai Basil, Mint Thai, and Swaddee is by far the best I've had. Their food is always delicious and it's the perfect combination of sweet and tangy and spicy. The service is excellent as usually and the servers are attentive and super nice. I always get the pad thai, tom ka soup, or their pineapple friend rice (to die for). Their thai iced team and mango with sweet sticky rice are both amazing desserts to have after the meal. They have very reasonable priced lunch and dinner specials that come with a salad and egg roll. Their portions are very generous and I always have left overs. I highly recommend this place!"
3,"It ain't bad at all.  I ate at district twice during my stay at the Sheraton.\n\nFor dinner I had a Man Meal: bacon-wrapped steak with sweet potato fries and it was goooooood.  Of course I washed it down with a few dainty glasses of Mumm champagne (hey champagne goes with ANYTHING) so that upped the girlie factor a little.  Service was both prompt and personal, so no complaints there.\n\nI had a lunch there as well; the macaroni and cheese came topped with crushed cheez-its (yum) but the addition of both andouille sausage AND pulled chicken was just a bit much.  One or the other would have done just fine."
3,"If you're looking for fresh poke this is the place to go. They have a wide variety to choose from, and they also have yummy deserts! I'm yet to try the sushi here. Overall, it's a great place with chill vibes and a friendly atmosphere!"
0,"They probably save money by hiring people that just got out of prison. You think they'd save enough to at least help out the situation. Reserved my room for a special event, with ZERO mention you need to make the reservation over the phone, instead of online. These people are behind on the times, so let's hope they get left in the dust."
1,"Will not go back to this location! I have had great experiences at Park Road and order take-out quite often from there. The Providence Road location always under-cooks. I said I wouldn't go back but decided to give it one more try this past weekend because it's close to our house.  My Calzone was wrong, only had cheese in it and was still doughy. The pizza we ordered was also still doughy. I hadn't ate all day and just ate it and went to bed. Big disappointment at this location! I will not give it another chance."
3,"I have been at quite a few BBQ restaurants (originally from the south.) I found it be pretty decent! I have the pulled pork; it wasn't dry, the BBQ sauce was really good! It reminded me of the BBQ place I would go to back home. I would recommend this place!"
3,"Au Petit Resto, malgr\u00e9 son nom, Au petit Resto n'est pas un petit resto. J'y ai \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le cadre d'un souper de groupe, nous \u00e9tions 10 et nous avions le menu de groupe. \n\nOn peut y voir toute de suite une certaine atmosph\u00e8re conviviale. Il y a un petit foyer en plein milieu, pour se sentir \u00e0 la maison. Les h\u00f4tes sont tr\u00e8s aimables, ils se sont accommod\u00e9s \u00e0 notre groupe et on permis certaines personnes de prendre autre chose que le menu de groupe.\n\nJ'ai commenc\u00e9 avec une salade de betterave. C'\u00e9tait bon. Salade de betteraves, verdure et fromage de ch\u00e8vre. You can't go wrong with that. Je vous avouerai que, jusque l\u00e0, rien d'impressionnant. \n\nC'est au menu principal que la magie a fait son effet.  J'ai choisi de manger la cuisse de canard confite, salade et frites maisons. Je dois dire que c'est tr\u00e8s bon. La cuisse de canard \u00e9tait si tendre et dure \u00e0 la fois. Les frites \u00e9taient malade, car elles avaient un peu de gras de canard qui avait coul\u00e9 dessus. Oh oui.\n\nAlors que j'\u00e9tais enchant\u00e9 par ma cuisse de canard et les restants de mes coll\u00e8gues, le charme a diminu\u00e9 au niveau du dessert. J'ai pris la cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Je sais, c'est un peu le dessert trop facile. J'ai donc \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7u en go\u00fbtant une cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e qui ressemble aux autres. Je recommanderais donc le tiramitsu, qu'un ami avait pris et qui \u00e9tait bien bon.\n\nJ'y retournerais? Peut-\u00eatre pour les soupers de groupe, je dois dire que la place est vraiment pratique pour cela."
1,"I did not like their food at all. Had one dish, sent it back, the second plate was just as horrible. Not close to authentic Mexican food at all. The atmosphere is very nice though. The authentic music made the atmosphere even better! Haven't gone back since I went the first time. Go at your own risk!"
4,Great Vegan Food! I love their caramelized onions- yummmm.
2,"After almost a full week of Indian food last week, I began the week on a bang, and had a hankering for.... more Indian food.  Since my favorite Indian place is closed Mondays, I decided to try out a place one of my coworkers praised: Kabab Palace.\n\nIt started out promising.  There were plenty of options, including plenty of vegetarian, chicken, and even a goat dish.  I ended up with a plate of plain ole' white rice (because I didn't see the good rice oddly further down the buffet), some butter chicken, tandoori chicken, a green bean dish, shish kabab, chicken curry, and the goat.\n\nNone of it was bad, but I was reminded why more options is not necessarily better.  None of them were done particularly well.  The flavors were a bit bland (though not Delhi Palace bland).  Most annoyingly, the butter chicken dish, though boneless, had small bits of bone mixed in, as if the chef had just shoved an entire chicken through a meat grinder.  There is nothing worse than biting down on a chunk of bone when you thought you were eating boneless meat.\n\nBetween the haphazardly deboned meat, warm water in my glass, and somewhat bland flavor, I left somewhat disappointed.  Pasand, a few miles away, is better.\n\nMy coworker who was with me commented that it felt like we were cheating on Taj Mahal by eating somewhere else.  Luckily for us, it just made us appreciate Taj Mahal even more."
1,"The food was fine but the service was atrocious.  We went for an early dinner before a game and only a few tables were occupied.  Nonetheless, after asking for a few minutes to look over the menu, our waiter disappeared and never came back.  We flagged down another employee who got the waiter.  After we got the food, he checked on us once and disappeared.  We never saw him again.  A young woman brought the check after we flagged down yet another employee and asked.  Really, where were all the servers?  \n\nIt was also disappointing to me that the bill was not clear.  On one side was 4 * $6.50 for drinks but no drink total anywhere.  On the other side was our two entrees, each with a price, and then a grand total.  I like to check the bill so I calculated it and it was right, but why not list all the items ordered, then tax, then a total?  \n\nWe were late for our game."
4,"Would you like the BEST Thai food in America? Go to Lotus of Siam. \n\nSuch a hidden little gem in Vegas, in a not-so-classy strip mall, but trust me, the food is 5 stars. Anything you order on this menu will be terrific but the one thing you MUST order is the large Hot Pot of the Tom Yum Prawn Soup with lime & lemongrass. IT'S SOOOOOOO yummy & healthy. \n\nI wish they would open in LA because I can't drive to Vegas just for soup."
0,"Eat here at your own risk.  This place is horrible!  We went around 12pm, which must be the start of their lunch rush because they were very busy. But we were sat at a table immediately.  It was approximately $9/person - without drinks.  There ends the good news.  The food is tasteless and it wasn't fresh. The employees are very rude.  And it is extremely loud in there (maybe because of the tile floors). A few hours after eating there, both me and my friend were experiencing stomach discomfort.  I will never eat here again."
4,"I recently stayed at the pointe and went to Rico's for a birthday dinner. We had David as a server he was fantastic. Personable, attentive, prompt, overall we had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend the Pasta Del Mar it was delicious and the kiddos liked that a cookie came with the kids meal. \n\nWe were not impressed with the hostess she wasn't very friendly but everyone else throughout the evening was excellent."
3,French dip.  Mac n cheese balls.  Very tasty for a very late night snack.
2,"really not a bad room. i don't know how the setup was prior, but, i liked what is here. around 15 tables set up next to the sports book and the sports restaurant. tourists playing and some locals. tournament buy-ins are $35 plus $5 for the dealer option, totalling 4000 chips. rebuys for the first 2 levels at $5 for 2000. cash games were minimum $65 for the $1-2NL. didn't too good during the morning sessions, but, the evenings went pretty well for me. dealers were pretty cool and bosses were nice enough to look for my MLife number to track my play. oh yeah, and i'm not a fan of the no-wheel, non-adjustable chairs. :("
1,"Cheap car rentals. This was my first time renting to I wasn't sure how it was gonna go down. I'm currently 24 so I was going to need additional insurance. I was hoping my bf was gonna be able to drive because he's a way better driver. But because I was unaware of that other insurance it was a lot more than what I initially reserved.\n\nThe guy was nice enough to waive the fee of the additional driver. The car we got was a small ford fiesta. Definitely a gas saver.  It was great for the basic car, but it did keep making this weird sound when you stepped on the gas, I was worried.  I rate so low because I didn't find the staff to be as helpful.  The deposit is fairly large, and it took awhile for the pending transaction to be removed from my credit card account.\n\nIt is what it is. At the phoenix airport, fox is definitely one of the smaller rental places compared to the other ones all around it.  Their cars were located at the bottom of the lot, it can be confusing but I read previous reviews to help me out. I'd rent again just for the price, but I'll wait til I'm 25 lol"
2,"We originally were headed to brunch at some \""new\"" coffeehouse in Lawrenceville, but when their menu was NOT very brunch friendly, we decided to eat somewhere else.  We walked to New Amsterdam and the menu looked lackluster their as well.  We turned around to see if anything was near us and that is when we saw the City Cafe.\n\nWe walked up and upon just seeing how HOT the server was we decided to eat brunch right there!!  ;-)\n\nAnyway, it's a vegetarian restaurant.  The food is good...IF you can get the old man (the owner and cook unfortunately) to actually want to prepare something.  Each time we have been there when he doesn't have a server, he is somewhat rude and acts as if he is being put out to make our food.  WHEN it's made, it's always delicious.\n\nHe makes a point to mention each time how his old restaurant in San Fran I believe it is used to be a \""lovers\"" soda pop shop.  Tables were for 2 people ONLY.  I think he is somewhat irritated if more than 2 arrive.  \n\nAnyway, the entire scene is very weird.  If only the food wasn't so dang good!"

3,"Cute decor and a tasty frosty beverage called the Frozen Hot Chocolate. \n\nIt pretty much tastes like a chocolate milk with ice and whipped cream and chocolate shavings.\n\nOn a hot day, I think it may make some people crumble to their knees. The wait? Well, we got lucky on a Monday and sat at the bar as soon as we walked in.... No complaints here. \n\nShare with a couple of friends and you won't feel so cheated. The decor was cute and worth a moment to roll through if you like cutesy places."
1,"Maybe it is that we visited on our third day, after having visited Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon... We kept exchanging 'What happened to this place?' glances during whole dinner. We - hubby, brother & yours truly - used to think that The Buffet was the BOMB but last visit left us wondering why we should ever come back.\n\nJust few examples - \n* Salty icy king crab legs: totally not edible\n* Prime rib with serious lack of flavor: I don't mean put a ton of salt, no. I mean just adequate seasoning to bring out the natural flavor\n* Subpar sushi/ sashimi\n* Dessert that are pretty to look at but totally deficient in bright fresh flavor or delight to a perfect end of a meal\n\nWhy not create a competitive edge with low glycemic dessert selection with stevia (not the Truvia junk... Use Stevia in The Raw) or organic blue agave syrup (Costco carries them), for example? Or how about artisanal ice cream/ sorbet that packs some awesome flavor?\n\nReally, for the money and time (which equals to money) that we spent and for comparative selections out there... Hmmm. \n\n1 star for ambiance - locational advantage of being at Bellagio\n1 star for service - we got our drinks & silverwares and reasonably efficient removal of used plates"
2,"There was a lot of hype about this spot, I'm not saying I wasn't satisfied but I'm not saying I was as impressed as I thought I would be after all the hype.\nLike any other buffet, there are a lot of options and there was a long wait. The difference between this buffet and the majority of the buffets on the Vegas strip is that this one had lots of seafood options - which I prefer because I don't eat a lot of meat and if I could, I would only eat fish. Also, we had a Pescatarian in our group, so it was much easier than usual for her to find yummy food to eat. =] \nThe one thing I really enjoyed here was the desserts! They were made so beautifully and tasted like heaven!\nThe service and staff here was on point, not once during my meal was my drink anywhere empty nor was our table crowded of dirty dishes. [needless to say, our group left a good tip ;]\n\nThe price wasn't bad, especially since I ate lots of salmon poki & sushi; definitely ate my worth ;]\n\nWhen I go to Vegas again, I'll be eating here for dinner again since theres lots of seafood options and I'm not a steak and eggs kinda person."
2,"I give three stars because it wasn't horrible. My food was edible so eating here is not completely out of the question. There is nothing that makes me want to come back. \n\nMy experience started with a host who was friendly and seated us with no wait. I asked her a question about the special written on the chalkboard she was unable to answer. Not a big deal I don't expect the host to know the menu. I came solo with my two kids we got settled and the server took our drink order. He seemed less than enthusiastic about giving any suggestions other than the house margarita that was on special. I took him up on his suggestion and got what I expected. A standard run of the mill house marg which I poured some of my corona in to change it up. I  went with the 6oz sirloin and half rack of ribs. The steak was ok, low expectations from a chain. The ribs on the other hand were comparable to jerky. Over cooked and under sauced. This was my servers suggestion to get the ribs. I know this guy has never tried these ribs because if he had it would be the last thing out of his mouth. I can get a meal at hundreds of establishments. This server must think business falls from the sky as opposed to being built on customer service and food quality. I am disappointed at the lack of passion this individual possesses. I was hoping for an experience that warranted a repeat visit.   This restaurant is under achieving. I hope this review prompts a server meeting about guest relations."
2,"I was sooo excited to try this place after hearing all of the hype! Not what I thought it was going to be... Food is alright, nothing to write home about. I had the fried whitefish taco which was decent, but I've had much better. The margs were off though... Didn't even taste like a margarita to be honest and nobody at my table even finished half of theirs. I think there are much better Mexican places in the area."
3,"My second time here and was just as good the first time. The Mesa Marg is great. Our waiter had them there asap, which to me means alot! I really think if a waiter can get me a cocktail,water or something to help pass time while deciding what you want to order, they have me. My wife had the Pork tenderloin and it was spicy and good! I had the Bone in Rib eye and it was fantastic! Churros for desert, you will not be disappointed!"
3,"This restaurant is one of a kind here in Vegas for overall experience. Although they no longer have the show, there are 6 different rooms in this entire venue. The decor is vintage chic and the food is innovative and whimsical. During dinner you will have live entertainment with musicians, singers, and dancers using all parts of the dining room. During their gig, the music is pretty loud so don't expect too much conversation but they are entertaining. Dinner style is meant for sharing but portion size for many dishes suggest to share for 2. \nFor dinner my highlights were the Crispy Chicken, Pork Belly, and Beet and Avocado Salad. I also really enjoyed their take on a strawberry shortcake. You have to try it Yum!! I wouldn't say I dislike any of the other things I ate, the others were just not memorable."
0,"The Good the Bad and the Ugly\n\nThe Good\nNice resort, nice location.  Well designed, even pretty, excellent pools, one very big and one for adults, perfect!  Staff, really nice, responsive and helpful, Jake and Tara particularly.\n\nThe Bad\nDark dingy main room, had to have the lights on all the time.  One small, one foot by two foot window in the corner.  Noisy, poor sound insulation between apartments.  We could clearly hear the guy snoring at night next door, and when other guests put some music on, it was like they were in the same room.  Older furniture, very old small CRT TV (no flat screen) awful sound quality.\n\nThe Ugly\nInternet very very slow.  Billed as high speed...  Reached a peak of 1.5Mbps, some of the time, most of the time it was less than that. Could watch web pages very slowly build, my email (outlook) would intermittently time out.  Although they gave me a voucher, for most they actually charge for the service!  Hard wired in the room only.  The staff get 6.3Mbps, guests 1.5Mbps at best...  \n\nI'd be happy to pay extra for high speed internet (5Mbps or greater) 1.5Mbps is not high speed.  More like snail speed internet.  Could not stream movies, could not get any work done.  Called AT&T, spoke to resort management, was like asking a tree to uproot, all very nice people, no results.\n\nFor me the crap internet was a show stopper, I won't be back...    \n\nIf you are here on vacation and don't plan to spend much time in your room, then the place is probably fine.  However if you are like me, combining work and leisure, spending a fair proportion of you time in the room actually trying to get some work done, you will be frustrated..."
1,"The food is OK, but ASK FOR AN ITEMIZED RECEIPT. They overcharged me, my sister, and a friend on 3 separate occasions. Their explanation was that the prices went up but they hadn't had time to update the menu... but it has been months since the first time I was over charged. I will not give business to dishonest people."
1,Meat is fresh but fries are just average at best. Had to ask too many times for condiments. Go to 5 guys if u just want a burger.
4,Dr. Chawla has a very keen eye for detail.  Which is great cause I am a picky patient.   I needed to have some work done and Dr. Chawla understood all my concerns and got the dental work done perfect the first time!  Really enjoyed my time there - The office manager is a hoot too.
2,Food was good.  Service was mixed.  Wierd interaction with a bartender who said the place had nothing to do with San Francisco.  All the marketing in the hotel seemed to lend itself that way.
4,Staff is very knowledgable about their products and what shoes will fit my lifestyle.  I always walk away satisfied and with shoes that are perfect or me!!
0,The pupusas were gross and so were the waitresses with their rotten attitude. Never ever going back again.
3,"hit CJ's this weekend - group meal.\n\nribs, turkey, brisket, chicken, pulled pork sammies, mac n cheese, chili, slaw, potato salad, corn , bluebird/bluebunny/ somethin' or another blue ice cream - mint chip. A WHOLE LOTTA FOOD !!!\n\nthe winners - the ribs and the turkey - GREAT !\n\nloser - pulled pork - kinda tough, not very smoky.\n\nAnother BBQ place that has improved ( slightly ) since my last visit."
4,"We absolutely loved this show. First of all, there are the amazing acrobatic stunts. I couldn't believe some of the stuff they were able to do. With the size of the tent, every seat is a good seat, and you have an up close and personal view of everything that is being done. Besides the acrobatics, there was also some great, highly offensive (to some), politically incorrect, raunchy comedy...which was awesome. My husband and I laughed until we cried. If you sit in the front, there is a good chance you could be picked on, so don't sit there unless you are ok with that. And if you are easily offended, or are a big ol' stick in the mud, don't bother going to this show. But if you have a fun sense of humor and enjoy seeing some fun acrobatic stunts, then this is the show for you."
0,"1 And ye the LORD looked down upon the earth 2 and He saw a hovel on Apache Boulevard 3 and saw fit to populate it with a mere approximation of pescetarian \""food\"" for 4 our God is a vengeful, spiteful, cruel God.\n\n5 The sins committed by the men of Tempe were so wicked as to deserve such punishment 6 that they were never to be spoken of. 7 A pile of horrible, tiny pieces of fish-meal 8 are the LORD's manna from hell, 9 a punishment unlike any other on the soul, mind, and stomach.\n\n10 Requiring only the smallest number of shekels, 11 God sought to tempt even he without sin 12 into sampling its putrid fruit, 13 the punishment for partaking not unlike that of Adam and Eve, having partaken of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.\n\n14 As they bit into the crusty, bland fish, 15 they became aware of their horrible betrayal of God and their stomachs 16 and were banished to the restroom for the rest of the evening. \n\n17 \""Frozen chunks of pressed fish meal does not fried fish make\"" sayeth the LORD, issuing several commandments. 18 Thou shall not try the Pete's Sauce for it is awful and I hath spewed it from my mouth as it was lukewarm and tasted horrible. 19 Thou shall not give in to temptation for cheap fish, when it is known that Pete's is neither cheap (for one's soul, if not the wallet) nor fish. 20 A curse upon the household of any man who tries the hamburgers. The cramping of 10,000 stomachs shall be felt upon your own gut, a horrible taste left in your mouth for eternity. 21 You will forever recall the intense disappointment I feel of you as you feel for the meal you consume at Pete's. 22 It shall cast your mouth and gut into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n\n23 The serpent may tempt with \""chips\"". 24 \""Do not heed his words,\"" sayeth the LORD. They are soggy, ill-prepared, and above all, flavorless. 25 The breading hath no flavor but sadness, the fish no flavor but bland meal, both betraying its true genesis: 26 A frozen, preformed patty of processed misery. 27 God condemned this abomination and called, \""you are not one of my creatures!\""\n\n28 \""They shall take only cash, as not even the credit card companies dare near their tainted field,\"" God commanded.\n\n29 The seventh angel will pour out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice will come out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, \""It is done!\"" And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth. 30 Now the city was condemned to only ever eat from Pete's forevermore, an eternal damnation, a hell on earth, the sins of man so great, the punishment fitting with God's will."
0,"My first 1 star review ever...\n\nSo many problems with this place, where to start. The rooms are run down, the hotel is run down, it is a good long walk away from most of the strip, the type of people that stay there are obnoxious and so many other issues. Most of the problems I could live with because of the price. The problem I had was the type of people that low price attracts. I was told that it is a nice environment to stay in and it was a fun hotel, which may be true. I was shocked by how many people try to turn a trip to Vegas into a family vacation by staying here. I was appalled by the parents that walked around playing slots while smoking and holding an infant. Parents let their little children just run around the hotel unsupervised while they got plastered at the bar. \n\nI am all for going to Vegas to gamble and drink excessively. But please leave your kids home."
3,"I have mixed feelings about REI. I used to sell outdoor gear for Popular Outdoor Outfitters (now defunct). When we didn't carry something a customer was looking for, which wasn't often, we sent them to REI.  \n\nREI is the destination in the valley for high-end outdoor gear. However, their prices reflect this. I really like the REI store-brand gear. It's durable and the price point is pretty good. Anything else in the store, however, has a larger mark-up than you would find elsewhere. If you're looking for something you could buy elsewhere without trying it on, shop around online for a better deal. \n\nTheir dividend program is nice, though. REI is technically a co-op, meaning you can pay a one-time fee (20$ nowadays) and sign up for the dividend program. You receive some percentage of your purchases back as a dividend to spend in the store. They also have a Visa card which lets all of your purchases feed into your yearly dividend at a lower percentage. They issue dividends in the spring, just in time to get geared up for the new season.\n\nNew info: I was digging through my dividend packet, and it turns out you can actually get your dividend in cash. See the store for details."
4,"A very well deserved 5-stars. Checked out my new neighborhood spot last night & was overly impressed with the level of customer service & the amazing shrimp in trifecta sauce ($12) with a level medium heat. They know how to bring the heat! Be careful when ordering your heat level. \n\nThe interior is fun and lively. I think the pricing is very fair & I look forward to trying out lobster, and fried clams! \n\nWhat an amazing addition to the neighborhood! Keep up the good work."
0,Other than a nice patio there is nothing to recommend this place. Food is not good. The pork in the vermicelli was fatty and the veggies consisted of iceberg lettuce and a few carrot sticks. The service was incredibly slow and the music so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation. If they want to be a night club go for it but as a restaurant not cool.
3,"I was looking for a good breakfast place and Yelp recommended this place in Montreal.  I must say overall I was impressed with the food.  I went there on a Tuesday morning for breakfast so it wasn't that busy (though it did get busy at lunch time when we were getting ready to leave).  Based on other reviews I understand there can be quite a wait though depending on when you go so be prepared.\n\nTheir brunch menu offered a nice selection of dishes.  I ordered the chorizo 2 which is eggs benedict done with chorizo sausage served with homemade potatoes.  Overall this dish was very well done.  My companion had something similar and thought it was quite tasty as well.  I will say the hollandaise sauce was quite rich however, too rich for my blood.  I am sure that meal had well over 2000 calories and half of them was in the hollandaise sauce alone.  I wish they had gone a little lighter on the sauce but the meal was still quite enjoyable.\n\nThe reason they lose a star is for the terrible service.  I'm from Ottawa originally and I'm visiting Montreal and I do understand that people are a bit more 'trendy' in Montreal but I could not get the look the staff were going for.  The only term I can use to describe the staff that work there are 'ignorant hipsters who don't care about their patrons'.  The attire of the male staff working there was something an angry emo teenager would wear.  Our waiter was rude and no where to be found most of the time.  I had to flag other staff down just to get a refill on coffee, to get the bill etc.  The menu is French only and I think in this day and age having an English menu is a must for most places in Montreal.\n\nI did not care for the ambiance at all.  They try very hard to be trendy but in my opinion in just comes off as tacky.  The music was also extremely loud making it difficult to hear anybody trying to speak.  The price-to-quality ratio at L'avenue is good and at the end of the day is the most important thing for me.  If you can look beyond the tackiness of this place and the poor service, the food is quite good here."
0,Do not live here.  The apartment management is terrible.  Avoid at all costs.
1,"The Trump is a fine hotel that's clean and nice, but for the price, you can get much, much, much better.\n\nFirst the positives.  The rooms are huge--the Trump was originally built to be condos, not a hotel--and have nice amenities like a hot tub with jets and a stove and microwave.  The staff was also friendly and helpful.\n\nBut there are too many negatives to recommend this hotel.  \n-- The parking situation is wretched.  The Trump only does valet (no self-parking) and they are horribly understaffed.  We waited over 20 minutes just to drop off our car, and nearly missed our show.\n-- The $25 resort fee borders on outrageous.  I know it's a new \""trend\"" for hotels to tack on a mandatory fee for Internet and gym use, but I've never seen more than $10/day at even the nicest hotels.  $25/day is pretty insane.\n-- The pool is really weak.  One small rectangular pool surrounded by chairs is all you get.  We ended up schlepping to another hotel to use their pool.\n-- Certain things in the room were broken.  The main TV in the room was tilted off center, and the TV in the bathroom wouldn't turn off.  We ended up just muting it.\n-- There's a freight train that runs a block away from the hotel and it's LOUD.  Trains only come by maybe 3-4 times a day, but just one train at 3 AM is all you need to ruin your night.\n-- The bed was one of the more uncomfortable ones I've ever slept on at a hotel.  Way too soft, with weak, flaccid pillows.  I spent much of my weekend groggy and came home with a sore back--and not for the usual Vegas reasons.\n\nA new 5-star hotel opens in Vegas every month.  Pick one of those instead."
0,"This is the mother\n\""The hair that I gave your server was in the food that was served to me. I pulled it out of my mouth. The hair was grey, not blonde! I then placed it on the tablecloth next to me to give to your server. We did not expect you to comp the entire meal. We did expect you not to try and charge us for the dish with the hair in it. Not only did you charge for the dish, you offered us a free dessert and yes, we ordered two. So what did you do? You gave us the cheaper one for $7.00 and charged us for the dish that cost $12.00. The right thing to do would have have been for you, the chef/owner to come out, apologize and make it right. We have enjoyed our other meals at your restaurant and have recommended it to our friends. This kind of experience leaves a really bad impression and does not excite us to come back or recommend you. With such a small venue, it seems to me that you would want your customers be leave happy. As an aside, my dish was shrimp with baby bok choy as was my daughters. Both dishes came with broccoli (substitute) , with no discussion or notice from the server! Sincerely, the mother who had the grey hair in her mouth.\"""

3,"Locally owned, family restaurant.  We bring our kids here all the time, and it is a wonderful, welcoming place.  Reasonable prices for what you get, and the bean dip for your chips is to die for!\n\nThis has become our local Mexican food go-to place for our family!"
2,"The pad thai is a different spin on pad thai that I wasn't a huge fan of.  It tastes pretty good.. but I just don't like vermicelli noodles very much and I like the cilantro, sprouts and tamarind flavor that typically goes into pad thai."
2,"I have to be honest, Ikea is not at all one of my favorite places.\n\nThe quality of their merchandise is super cheap and priced moderately when I would rather pay less for the quality I am getting.\n\nThe saving grace for Ikea is the sheer mass of items they have available. The look/style of the items are pretty neat and are definitely inspiration for a room or apartment.\n\nI really wish the quality was better, even though their prices are alright, you get what you pay for!\n\nI'd much rather buy quality items for a higher price, even estate sales would be better for what I am looking for I think. \n\nWho needs Ikea? College kids or people who need to furnish an entire home on a tight budget."
2,"It seems to me that you need to be either Fresh...or Easy.  Easy usually means processed.  I don't do processed.  I was actually wrinkling my nose at the number of processed foods.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I liked the produce section.  Bigger than TJ's, better quality produce than Sprouts.  So I'll be back for that I'm sure.   (Although I was surprised to see pre cut veggies.  Unlike Rachael Ray I have the ability to cut my own veggies.)  The prepared meals are great to grab on the way home, the sandwiches and salads are great to grab for lunch.  But it really fell short in other areas.\n\nThe mix of individual, organic, and \""big box store\"" items is random.  The meat is expensive.  They were missing things that I normally get at TJ's like protein powder, non fat yogurt (they only had low fat), quality frozen vegetables (Jolly Green Giant?  For real?), cheddar cheese sticks....and a bunch of other items.  The deli meat they had was processed a little too much for my liking. (I'm pretty sure I've never seen a cylindrical turkey) \n\nThe store itself is well laid out but I really don't see it becoming my grocery store.  I think I'll stick to TJ's for the bulk of my shopping and stop in here for produce."
1,"What is it about Las Vegas and its lack of good Chinese takeout? Are there cosmic Asian forces at work that keep finger-licking Kung Pao chicken or delectable broccoli beef far way from our boozy, desert collective, or are all the solid Chinese chefs locked in at proper sit-down restaurants on the Strip? \nRegardless of why the sleeping dragon of delicious Chinese takeout has never awoken in our little corner of the Mojave, I had high hopes for Chop Chop Wok.\nReading the reviews here on Yelp convinced me - dare I say - that might have finally found THE spot. You know, the kind of solid New York City-style takeout joint whose Mongolian beef melts in the mouth. Where the sweet-and-sour chicken is a stack of crunchy, honeyed bonbons of poultry goodness. Where the rice sucks you down into pillowy rivers of starch so delicious that you never want to come up for air.\nMan, did I have another thing coming.\nChop Chop Wok, unfortunately, is like a lot of neighborhood Chinese takeout joints here in Vegas: That is to say, it's run by a small coterie of smiling, accommodating folks ... who haven't the slightest idea how to turn out tasty dishes that trace their roots far back into the misty history of the Middle Kingdom.\nWhich is a shame, because the folks at Chop Chop Wok ARE friendly. They provide stellar customer service. It's just that once you get your coveted, white-paper takeout boxes home and dive inside you realize you'd have gotten closer to great Chinese takeout had you just gone to middle America's favorite, P.F. Chang's. \nWe tried a variety of dishes, but everything from the egg rolls to the crab rangoons to the beef and chicken dishes disappointed. \nWe're sorry, Chop Chop Wok. You're a bunch of truly nice people. But for those of us who've managed to find great Chinese takeout from Manhattan to the Midwest, we were hoping for so much more."
1,Have been waiting in the check-in line for 20 plus minutes. Line is getting longer & service getting slower. Not the best way to welcome people to Vegas.
2,"We had a large dinner party and ordered separately. We did not order appetizers or cocktails, just the main course. My family had the three meats (grilled hanger steak, ribeye and pork tenderloin) and the miso-marinated Chilean sea bass. The meats were flavorful. We enjoyed the ribeye and pork tenderloin the best of the three meats. The sea bass was good, but it was not worth $29 for a tiny piece of fillet fish. We thought it was going to be a whole fish, enough to serve more than one person. The service was good when our waiter took our order, but he never came back to check up on our table to see how we were doing. We had to order extra rice and miso soup from other waiters and staff. Our waiter finally came to our table just to drop off the check. The manager came around and asked about our food, and we told him about the issue with our waiter. He apologized and offered us bite-sized cookies. The food was good, but the service was okay."
0,"I'll keep this short. I've never given anything lower than a 3, until now. If I could give less than 1 star I would. I sat down and waited for over 30 minutes and not once did a waitress ask me what I wanted or even acknowledge me at all. How does that even happen?"
4,My fav pizza joint when I'm in vegas!!!! My brother showed me this place!!! \n\nNow it has become tradition of ours to stop by Every time we visit. \n\nAll the pizza's are delish & HUGE!!! Check in thru yelp and get a free Miller!! :) \n\nHaven't tried the garlic knot...waiting for my next visit to try it!!!
1,Went here this past weekend and it was NOT a good experience.  The food was ok but the service was horrible as soon as we walked in the door.  Definitely won't be going back.
4,FANTASTIC HH. \n\n$5 oak barrel aged cocktails (negronis and manhattans are usuals)\n1/2 off ALL bar bites\n1/2 off beer\n1/2 off ALL glasses of wine\n\nDAILY 3-6\n\nI cannot believe I just discovered their HH. Service NEVER wavers here. I love it. I know exactly what to expect and yet everytime I leave I feel a renewed sense of appreciation for CPH and everything they do there. Service at the bar is great! \n\nIs it HH yet? !
2,"Very hit or miss.  \n\nI'm giving 3 stars because I either get excellent service or horrible service.   \n\nThe food is decent bar fare, just a little pricey. \n\nFun place to hang out, watch sports and place horse bets.... When the service is good."
2,"Smells good when you walk in.  I was told the patio seating is nice in the summer time. This evening was gloomy.  The hostess was nice.  We did not see a server for a while longer than I would expect.  Once she did come she have great suggestions for the meat and cheese board.  I ordered a German Riesling. It was a great pick if you like sweet white wine!  Our orders came in timely.  The beef carpaccio was very good.  I love truffle oil. This beef was server rolled in 4 pieces. Very small and light.  We shared but I could have had one order to myself. The cheese board was large. A generous helping of meat... Salami, prosciutto, and a spicier meat.  The truffle cheese, Gouda, and third cheese we had her choose for us seemed so small in comparison to the meat.  Toasted bread and cranberry sauce also complimented the board. Everything turned out to be more than enough for the three of us. We took an hour to eat our appetizers as we were waiting for Allegro to open. The server had not tended to out table since the food had arrived.  After the hour passed we had to wave her down.  As I was taking my last sip of wine she asked me how I liked what I had chosen.  What we are was good.  For the type of restaurant it was, I definitely  expected better service."
4,"Shopped at this location and the customer service was awesome, highly recommend this store to my friends."
3,"This review is, again, waaay over due, but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here, thus I would like to share it with other potential customers. \n\nWe came here on Thanksgiving Monday, specifically to build our own poutines. I quite enjoyed the concept, and was surprised by the plethora of options given for type of fries, sauces, meats, veggies and cheeses. I built a poutine version of a Philly cheese steak; regular & sweet potato fries, cheese curds, gravy, flank steak and green peppers. \n\nThree words: AH. MAY. ZZZING. \n\nIt was delish; I am a huge poutine fan (duh, who in Quebec isn't!!) and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to venture outside the \""fries, cheese curds and gravy\"" boundaries of the original poutine!"
4,"Quite honestly, I do believe that the Wynn/Encore buffet is the BEST Las Vegas has to offer. \n\nIt's a little more expensive than other buffets on the strip, but, I have to say it's well worth it. \n\nI've gone to the Wynn buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Each time was truly sensational.\n\nThe quality and display of food at the Wynn buffet is exceptional. All the fruits and salads are fresh, everything else is top notch."
2,Yummy food and a friendly staff. I had the BBQ chicken with white meat and it was a huge dish. The BBQ sauce is very unique. I would definitely go back. There are other dishes I am curious about and I would love to try the peach cobbler.
0,"I just purchased a groupon for a manicure for my girlfriend, when she gets there to make an appointment there is a handwritten sign on the door stating that they are not accepting groupons and to not come in and bother the stylists. I cannot believe how rude that sign is. I took a picture and will never send anyone there."
2,I'm gonna be really frank about buffets. \n\nWicked Spoon at the Cosmo\n\nThe Buffet at the Wynn\n\nStudio B at the M\n\nare the top 3 in my book. Now Aria isn't a bad buffet place great service nice selection of foods. But I wouldn't really consider anything very gourmet here. All the food are staple foods the cocktail shrimp are not the highest grade compared to the above 3 but it's better than your hosh posh mix of janky buffets. The nice thing about the Aria that I did enjoy was that after the nice meal the walk around the mall next door was perfect to walk it off sorta speak.\n\nThe desserts in here as well were a-ok but nothing spectacular compared to the above 3. I got comped 2 buffets for staying at the signature so it wasn't really terrible considering I didn't pay. It's the same price nearly as the other buffets as well so consider this before actually making it out here.\n\nIf I'm near here I guess I'd hit this up since it's not terrible and meets the standard of buffets in Vegas!
2,"I learned about this place from here, Yelp. I live close to that place and pass by it everyday and have never noticed it. It used to be a donut store / bakery before this though and it looks like they left all of the fixtures behind from the previous owners and they sort of use them here. I walked it and there was literally one table in there and it looked like it was donated from someone's backyard and not only was there only one table but it seemed like people working there or friends/family of the people working there were taking that space up. \n\nThe place was fairly messy quite honestly. It looked like someones home kitchen if they were throwing a party on 4th of July. If you look behind the counter, you see a bunch of bowls everywhere, the dude that was preparing my order was looking for the scoop spoon everywhere found it on the counter and washed it, rather, rinsed it off before he scooped the macaroni into my box, plus it took me about 5 minutes before he even took my order and there was only one person before me and on top of that, one of the people that was sitting at that table kept going back behind the counter to get stuff and never even acknowledged me.\n\nI finally get to the counter to make my order. I ordered the Chicken Katsu. That's pretty much what I judge a Hawaiian restaurant by, how good their Chicken Katsu is. The guy that took my order prepared the rice and macaroni in my box while the cooks made the chicken... Then, almost as soon as he put the rice and mac in my box, he grabs his beer and steps outside for a moment to finish off his beer. I waited for about 10 minutes until the cook actually came out an bagged my food for me and called the guy back in to ring me up.\n\nThe first thing the guy says \""I don't care how busy it gets, if it's time for a beer, I need my beer\"". This was at about 4pm. He was cool the whole time though. It's not like he was belligerent or not courteous, but not exactly what I would consider good service. Still, I got no beef with that guy or that place. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Katsu lunch plate and it's probably some of the best Chicken Katsu I've had. Definitely better than what L&L has to offer, but nothing makes me want to go back there. If someone were to bring me food from there I would enjoy it but to go there and just see the place that looks so run down and the wait just doesn't seem worth it."
3,Wow!  Wan Fu is excellent.  The restaurant itself is huge and well appointed.  There is plenty of space for large groups.  We had a large group and ended up getting a ton of food and passing around.  One of my favorite dishes was a kind of duck taco.  It was delicious!  Everything else I tried was great as well.  Wan Fu is definitely a far cry from cheap Chinese buffets.  The service was very friendly and attentive and being locally owned is a big plus!
0,"Not a great grooming department & customer service stinks.\n\nFirstly, I called to make an appointment at  the grooming department about 2 weeks in advance and ask that the main groomer tend to my cat because this would be his first time at the groomers. They agreed and I set up the appointment. Upon entering the grooming area the groomers were all outside smoking and no one was at the desk. I waited for about 15 minutes and then I went outside and asked to speak to someone regarding getting my cat groomed.\n\nAfter they came in we discussed grooming and agreed on getting him an oatmeal bath, nail clipping, and trim. I had asked that he recieved a lion cut due to the Vegas heat. \n\nI was quoted an hour for the entire service so I was excited about the time due to the  fact I would be able to pick up groceries while he was being pampered. But before I left I noticed that here was some non-needed loud dryers going on in the back room (which had no animals in it). I asked that they only use the dryers when needed due to the fact that he is scared of loud noises, they ignored my request and tried to take him to the back. He of course would have none of that and they had to turn them off anyway.\n\nWhen I arrived back to pick him up he was just then getting dried. Another hour later they said he was done (2 1/2 hrs so far). They put him in his carrier before I saw him so I assumed he was done as we had discussed, payed them a pretty penny for the work, and went home. When I got home and took him our of the carrier I found that half of the agreed upon services were not completed. He had no lion cut, had danrif all on his fur, and his nails had been jaggly done. Needless to say I will not use their grooming services again.\n\nIn addition to the bad grooming services, this Petco has awful customer service in store. The cashiers are rarely avaliable up front and if you have questions or need anything you have to wonder around the store for some time to find someone. I personally refrain from going to Petco and instead reccomend Petsmart."
2,"First time here and had the showgirl dog, daughter had naked dog and hubby had Kim Kardashian and Showgirl dogs.  Daughter and I loved ours. Hubby was not too keen on the Kardashian dog because it was a polish one but he loves the showgirl dog.  We would come back again. Had it in the late evening and sat  outside and people watched.  We would come back again and try out the other items they have to offer.  It was a bit pricey though for four four dogs and three drinks came to about $50 and that was with a 10% off coupon we got from our hotel."
1,sigh... i use to eat here when i was in college. and now i ate there today and had good rice and spam... but what tasted like day old chicken and tough beef on the bento box. it did not leave a good impression on me. i really loved eating there during college. sigh how things do change.  sadly i know the aloha at the california hotel or ross j would have been a better idea to assuage my hawaiian cravings...
4,"It's worth the wait for sure, you can get a cut like this for the money anywhere. E my barber is flying to Portland to do my hair for me at my wedding. (Cedric is amazing also, to bad he retired.) But they take their time and never rush."
3,"can't really comment on the food as we didn't get any, but this review is for the service and the slush drinks they have.   We bought the groupon now deal where you get the yard drink for $12 instead of the usual $17.  the only reason i wouldn't give it a 5 star is that in the picture they show the hard which looks like the similar ones at fat tuesday etc, but when you use the groupon, you get a giant plastic beer bottle cup instead.  not that i mind as i think it is a little cooler, but it is slightly smaller so you get slightly less drink than the groupon advertises.  other than that, nothing but good things to say about the lady who helped us, and how the drinks tasted.  she let our whole group try each of the flavors before we picked what we wanted, and did a good job describing what was in each drink.  i ended up getting the moonshine as i am about getting the strongest drink offered at least once.  my friends got a mix of the other drinks and we were all happy.  i will say though, i didn't really notice myself getting anything more than slightly buzzed off the drink (its about 40 ounces), but i used the cup to make a big cherry pepsi (pepsi with cherry skky vodka) when we got back to the room which seemed to get me drunk, and it was a good container to carry the drink around with when we went out.\n\ni would be back to get the cup filled next time i am back, and try some of the food as it smelled really good and what people were eating, looked really good"
4,"A group of us visited Stone and Vine this past Friday for happy hour and we absolutely loved it. The service was stellar - friendly and instructive on the menu. Food was great, we had a couple of flatbreads, some meatballs, the clams and the mussels. All excellent. Very cool vibe inside as well. Highly recommend visiting this location."
2,"I was up in the area and stopped in. \nIf I lived in the area I would be here frequently but I do find that Sprouts has better prices.  \nMy favorite think about WF has always been their selection of vitamins and suppliments.  However, on this trip I found that many of the things I usually get or the variety I am used to was not present here.  [Sprouts won out again.]"
1,"Well, it's IHOP.  If you've never been to an IHOP before, this one seems to be a bit busier than the others but the overall feel is the same:\n\n- Fast food quality for restaurant prices\n- Unlimited mediocre quality\n- Lots and lots and lots of screaming/yelling children\n\nI don't know if the ratio of families with children versus everyone else is simply high or I am just unlucky, but almost always I find myself seated next to the large table of a family who thinks it's cute / appropriate / whatever to let their children scream and run around the table / restaurant.\n\nThis isn't IHOP's fault, but they could at least politely ask them to have their children seated while in the restaurant so as not to disturb other patrons.  Or is that just forbidden now?  I don't know.\n\nI used to get the Harvest Grain 'N Nut Pancakes here a lot (delicious), but changed it up.  Their Simple & Fit vegetable omelette is pretty good, but a little salty.\n\nThere's coupons that show up in the mail every now and again that entice us to come back.  Then we go and realize why we don't go without them."
3,Really digging this restaurant!  Solid go-to pizza place in the NW valley for lunch seekers. Great price and value. Made to order pizza just the way you want it.  Love it!
0,"Saturday night, went to their lounge with my cousins, even though we spent hundreds of dollars on drinks and playing crabs, the bartender couldn't get us an extra olives saying \"" this is not a buffet guys! Drinks are shitty; I tried to talk to the bartender to fix it for us; he said \"" deal with it, I don't want it back\""! Come on, what's an extra olive or fixing your own nasty drink! Talked to the manager, he didn't give a fuck either! I don't even want to give this review one star, but I have no choice. \n\nThere are so many places in Vegas where I can have more fun with half the price and better customer service! I will never go back to Encore.\n\nBartender name: Jolieo"
1,"Disappointing.  I know the location is in a hotel, but still, I expected better.  The serious flaw is the reflection off of the exhibit glass.  You cant enjoy the fish and other creatures because of the distracting glare from the various light sources.  I did like the jellies and the octopus, and the ray pool, where you can touch the animals as they swim by.  Overall, the aquarium is very small and it did not take much time at all to go through."
3,"First off I'd like to say that Sedona has been a great experience for me. The staff is friendly. Andy who helped me sign my lease is very personable and friendly. This apartment complex is great because it's right next door to a very large park and still very secluded. Whenever I'd ask for a work order, it would be completed the next day! Ricardo the maintenance man is awesome!!!! He works very hard for the renters needs maintaining and fixing anything that needs up keep. The rent at Sedona is very reasonable and well worth it!!! I did have some loud neighbors on one side of the apartment that also smoked a lot of marijuana but unfortunately we can't pick our neighbors. The pool is sometimes dirty, but again thats because of people who don't know how to clean up after themselves. There are pros and cons wherever you decide to rent but overall I would recommend this apartment to anyone!!!! \n****The only downfall to this company is when I terminated my year lease I was stiffed with a large bill that was sent to my new address: carpet cleaning $85, general cleaning $90, light paint $35, spray counter tops $250. I understand the general cleaning of carpets is necessary but if I knew I would being charged a $90 cleaning fee I wouldn't have cleaned it as good as I did! The apartment was very clean when I left and took pictures to prove it!!!! I tried to dispute some of the claims and they didn't have any of it. Anyways, all I'm trying to say for future renters is when your lease is due you probably will have a fee of $250 and up for general cleaning, shampoo carpet, and touch up paint. I just wished I was given a heads up for these fees or an estimate at the time of signing my contract so I wouldn't be so surprised while opening my mail! My bill was just shy of $400!!!! Plus they didn't even do a walk through when my lease was up!!!!! I called them and asked and they said no walk though needed and to just drop off the keys at thefront desk. If they did a walk through in the beginning of the lease then why not do one at the end of the lease? I just thought that was really dumb. I just feel like I didn't deserved to pay that amount. That apartment was very clean when I left (except carpet) and that is why I'm writing a review to let future renters know that YOU may be facing the same charges that I am speaking of today. But don't get me wrong, Sedona was and is a great place to rent. I recommend you to check it out for yourself."
4,"First of all, this place is first class and it was built for its residents, not for the folks that live down the hill or Buckeye. If Talisa U is complaining  about not letting her join our residents club, it's because you're not a resident within the community.... I get that you like shopping up here instead of buckeye, that's why we all live up here, it's safe and clean and we want to keep it that way, move up here is the simple answer."
3,"What a cute lunch spot! My sis-in-law took me here a few weeks ago after we got our nails done - a perfect end to a girl's afternoon! She had found it on Yelp (nice work, sis!) and wanted to try it. I'm never one to turn down food, especially if sweets are on the menu, so off we went.\n\nIt must be noted that the decor is awfully adorable. Clean, bright colors and comfy seats. Plus, I noticed that they have plugs conveniently located under the booths so people can plug in and work from their laptops. \n\nThe lunch menu is a combination of sandwiches and soups, all of which sounded extremely delicious. I ordered a combo, with 1/2 chicken salad and 1/2 California salad. My s-i-l did the chicken salad and a salad as well. Not only did the food come out quickly, it was delicious! Granted, I had barely eaten all day and was on the verge of eating my own fingernails, however, I would still venture to say that this is one of the best chicken salad sandwiches that I've had in a long time! And the salad had the perfect lettuce:toppings ratio. I definitely ate the entire plate in about 2 minutes... \n\nAnd of course there was room for dessert. There's *always* room for dessert in my world! We tried the whoopie pie and a cupcake. The whoopie pie was sooooo good! Just like a homemade ice cream cookie concoction should taste. The cupcake? Not so much. The icing was thick, hard and not for me, although the cake itself was moist and flavorful. \n\nMy only complaint is that it was FREEZING inside! Granted, I'm coming from the SF Bay area, where we rarely need or use A/C. But still, they were blasting it inside like there was no tomorrow. I had goosebumps the entire meal. But besides that, I really, really enjoyed myself here. Might be tempted to come back and have a wino lunch (they sell by the glass or bottle here) on a return visit to Vegas."
3,"If I could, I'd pin a medal on Best Hong Kong for the stupendously good Pork and Oyster Hotpot I had there the other night. At 8 pm on a Sunday night, the place was busy (with about 2 dozen Chinese and me) and the service was very good. Not a fancy place, but it's all about the food--and the food is seriously good."
3,"You'd never even know these were vegan cupcakes. Seriously. However the owner is making such decadent, moist, and well-structured cupcakes is pure magic. She puts plenty of love into her recipes and even tries some daring varieties. \n\nWe had the one with pretzels in top (I can't remember the name, but it was awesome), the one with peaches in the middle was equally awesome. Apparently, I haven't done a good job of remembering the names, but the cupcakes are great. \n\nThe shop is towards Meat & Fish Co at the back of the market. You'll have a great time chatting with the owner. She's very nice and gives you plenty of background on her product. \n\nGood stuff!"
0,"This company is very rude. They will not even consider working with anyone on times and dates. Victoria, the gal that answers phones is very rude. I had set up an appointment. Told her there would be no verification call as I would be on a flight home. To send them regardless and I would be there. Got a call that appointment was canceled die to lack of verification call. Was told they were with BBB. Could not find them.  If you have a choice do not use them."
1,Meh. Used to eat here years ago and it was much better. BBQ pork fried rice had an off taste. Beef (from beef and broccoli) was chewy. Egg roll was good I guess. Won't be ordering again.
3,"My wife and I went here bc I had a $15 off $30 coupon (thanks Station Casinos! Keep'em comin'). Anyway, its the only resto in Sunset Station that primarily serves seafood. We got the Oyster & Shrimp appetizer ($16) and Cioppino ($20). The oysters were pretty good with that fresh briny, salt water flavor while the shrimp were big and umm...tasted like shrimp. :P I like that they have a lot of sauces on the table so you can kind of taste test each once with an oyster or shrimp. The cioppino was good but it can't beat the one I had in San Francisco 3 yrs ago. Its served in a huge bowl with 2 big scoops of rice. Its slightly spicy with a good variety of crab, mussels, shrimp, and fish. I once came here before for their signature dish which is the crab pan roast. It pretty much seafood bolognese with rice. There are 2 downsides though with this place..1) PREPARE for a long wait time for your meal. I know its cooked to order which is great but after about 20 minutes you will start to feel the hunger pains. Testing your patience would be an understatement. And did i mention there were only 2 or 3 cooks and 1 waitress for the entire 25-30 seat resto? 2) The coupon is only good between 8-10 pm. We came at 730 pm and the waitress said we had to wait. So, we ended up leaving at around 915 pm. On a positive note, this place is close to our house so its the closest thing that we have to good seafood stew-type dishes."
2,"Service was ok. Not very personable but ok. Love the chips, salsa and bean dip. Very prompt  service but I gotta say, the fish tacos are horrible. Everything else was delicious. Server didn't even notice I ate one bite and left the entire entree on the plate."
4,"I started training with Tony Rice a year ago. I workout 3 times per week 1 on 1 with him for 1 hour sessions. I've been really impressed with how knowledgeable he is in the area of workouts and nutritonal advice. He helped me find a good online food journal and provided me with lots of recipes & ideas on how to eat healthy. He also caters the workouts to the individual clients needs and that is very helpful. Working out with him has really transformed my life. I've been going to gyms for 20 years now and yet have never gotten the results that I've gotten under the direction of Tony. I have a whole new outlook on how to workout harder and smarter and a good nutrition balance so that I can still enjoy life and also I have more energy. I like the individual 1 on 1 workouts but he also provides group classes as well and those are very popular. I would definately recommend working out with Tony. I have been very pleased with the results in the year that I've worked out with him. As you can see from my new address I will be moving to Los Angeles June 1st. I will definately miss the 1 on 1 workouts with Tony and it will be a challenge to find someone who possesses his motivation, expertise, and charisma. I would highly recommend his training services. Thank you Tony for a transformational year.\nSincerely,\nBrent"
0,This place is the biggest rip off! They should be ashamed wanting to charge $29 to change a battery on a cheap Timex watch. I could not stop laughing. They would not tell me how much the battery cost. I took the watch to Victoria at Wall-Mart who charged me the price of the battery which was about $4 and she replaced it at no cost in about 3 minutes. Thanks Victoria!  I also got 2 batteries for the price of one. Screw the warranty at Fast-Fix. Ha-ha.
1,"I have eaten in this restaurant several times over the last 3 years. I always give it another try after a long period of time goes by. Then when I go back I remember exactly why it's been so long. Value for the price. When I go to a pizza place and order a pepperoni pizza, I don't expect to hunt to find a piece of pepperoni on it when I open the box.  I'm always dissappointed when I go to this place. especially when I drop $60 - $70 and my kids eat 3 bowls of pasta.  there's just too many other restaurants to try that will give you better value for my money. Service is ok, fook is good, (when they get it right) I give this place a 5 on a scale of 0-10.  (it's missable.)"
1,"Fun atmosphere- not too great food. Took my kids (3 & 8) and we had such poor service. The server gave my kids giant glasses with straws, but then gave the table next to us kiddie cups. When I asked for the same cups she acted all put out and never came back with them. Then she charged me adult beverage prices. We also had to request a to go box three times.  I have eaten here three times now- never that great. Street tacos are 75 percent cabbage. They have left the avocado out of my salad . I went once for a school function- the taco station beef tasted like Mc Cormick's taco seasoning. I must admit the chips and black bean salsa are great, but hey it is Arizona we can get that anywhere.\nI may meet up with the gals for drinks and chips, but not bring my family here ever again."
0,I am very disappointed in their services.  I agree that navigating the phone system is a nightmare...and they don't get back to you...ever.  I had a very minor procedure done in the office and they didn't fix it...but they want to keep charging me a copay and also charge my insurance company repeatedly to get it right.
2,I was cranky when I came in here ....this hardly ever happens to me ...so I 'll just stick to the facts. I really wanted to go to the buffet but I don't always get my way so we came here to eat. \n\nThey have a wide variety of food ...they even have an extensive Chinese menu . In the past I did try their Strawberry Chicken which was really delish! I've been trying to eat healthier lately so I begrudgingly stayed away from the Chinese menu. I really wanted some fried rice but I soldiered on. \n\nI had their BLT which is out of my norm but I was trying to follow Weight Watchers Point System. Since this didn't have that many ingredients it was easier for me to break everything down to points. I chose Multigrain bread for the sandwich. It of course had Bacon ...wasn't greasy or salty . It also had the lettuce and Tomato...with no Mayonnaise. It was a pretty basic sandwich but it was really good for what it was.
1,"food was good - service horrible.\n\n1. appetizer was served with no plates, crumbs were all over the table. \n2. finished sandwich and had very few fries left on the plate and the waitress actually comes back to offer ketchup....\n3. drinks were refilled but the empty ones did not get removed, cup rings all over.\n4. waitress drops the receipt & pen on the table lethargically - usually wouldn't care to notice but hard not to notice when it makes a thud - great last impression, with a messy, wet and crumb-y table.\n\nonly going back for to-go."
4,"Awesome happy hour!  Especially Wednesday when champagne and oysters are half off! Really big happy hour selection. Amazing food, drinks and service. Highly recommend!"
3,"Well, my family and I decided on the Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner. When we arrived, the hostess cheerfully greeted us and swiftly seated us. My two grandchildren ordered sliders and French fries with ketchup on the side. My wife ordered lettuce wraps. Now I need to tell you how picky and particular she is with this dish. After the first bite, her comment was \""this is the best lettuce wraps I've ever had.\"" My daughter ordered a grilled vegetable salad which was excellent. Last but not least, I ordered Boulliabaise, over a large bed and portion of spegattini rested fresh muscles, clams, shrimp and white fish. Another excellent dish and choice experience a fine meal. We will make the Cheesecake Factory a special place for us to dine. Thank you so much!"
1,"Ok, Tired of Subway, very very tired... \n\nNew Sub place across from my fave grocery store LeeLee,,, anyways,, went into SideWinder, and there was one other customer.. \n\nChecked out the menu, and then stood there,, seemed like about 5-8 minutes before I was asked if i knew what i wanted to order.. REALLY ?\nno warm greeting, good am, afternoon, let us know when you are ready,, and yes, the other customer was already at a table with his sub,, After the fail in greeting and hospitality, I ordered and decided for TAKE OUT.. definitely no sense of urgency form the 2 working here and got my sub and drove 2 miles home.. Home, unwrap the samich, and the bread is totally SOGGY, and not from mayo or oil, but from sitting in water like soggy,, yuck, 1/2 the samich was no good,, there is no way that they didnt notice when making the samich.. \n\nIf Lees sandwich took Credit Cards i would go there from now on,, but looks like i may need to drive a little further. !!"
0,"Beware if you have curly hair! \nSo we get a coupon for a haircut and my daughter is all exited, she wants to get a haircut.  Ok, I say with hesitation.  She goes between long and short hair all the time and although I would rather have her hair long, I always think well it is only hair it will grow back, can't be that bad.\nWell, I guess it could be...  We get there, place is empty, should have run while we had a chance...  I pay extra for shampoo /wash.  The lady asks my daughter how she wants her hair and proceeds to cut it.  So it looks ok till about 10-15 min later when the hair dried and them omg terrible.  The hair was all puffy and it looked like a big triangle.  Just awful.   Now I spend a lot of time and money putting product and trying to find creative ways to get her hair to not look so bad.\nWell lesson learned, will not go back there again!"
3,"When I noticed Blizz as I was strolling through the Studio Walk at MGM, I figured it would be just like any other Frozen Yogurt place.  Thankfully, Blizz was actually  much better than I thought it would be.\n\nThe morning after we noticed it, we stopped for Breakfast. We got two Cafe Mocha's, a Ham & Cheese Crepe and a Congo Crepe.  The Ham & Cheese had plenty of both and the bite I stole tasted very good. The Congo had Bananas and Nutella with lots of Whipped Cream. It was like having dessert for breakfast, which is a good thing on vacation! The Coffees were just OK.\n\nNext time I visit, I'll try the Yogurt and maybe even a drink from their Bar!  \n\nYou order at a Counter so it is wheelchair accessible and the staff will provide assistance if needed."
0,"If you genuinely care about the well being of your animal companion, do not take them here. It's unfortunate that this is the 24/7 clinic that is closest to me, but they have have no idea what they are doing. I brought my dog in for surgery on the same wound twice because of their mistakes and they flat out told me they don't know what to do, printed out my records for me and reccomend I visit another vet. The lack of\nintelligence in their profession is embarrassing and I am very upset with them doing work on my dog and finding out they had no idea what they were doing the whole time. Disgusting."
2,"A nice small casual place north of the Las Vegas strip. It is located on a weird corner street and parking is limited. The menu is in both English and Spanish and price are reasonably affordable as compared to restaurants on the strip. The air circulation could improved. It was a bit muggy inside but satisfying enough to be away for the Las Vegas heat.\n\nThere was a good variety of food available so narrowing can be tough. I've ordered the chicken arepa while my brother ordered the beef arepa. I recommend the beef over the chicken. Personally, I believe there's more flavor between the two. The outside of the arepa is a bit oily so be careful not to remove the wrapping. I made the mistake of removing it and it broke into pieces.\n\nBy the way, they charge 50 cents for a cup of water as indicated on the sign. What kind of place does this for tap water? This is a disaster recipe for BYOH2O."
4,"BF surprised me and took me here for late lunch. the place is huge! we stopped in the middle of the week and there was probably 4 other couples there. the staff looked pretty bored, all stood around pretending to work, one staff was cold so she literally walked around covered up in her blanket...very professional! not. anyways wait staff didn't seem to enjoy her work either nor did she stopped by frequently for anything. I honestly was not happy with the staff but the food made up 100%! bf ordered the button buster and I ordered the shrimp po boy and we both shared an order if tater tots! there were condiments on the table and the crack dip was really crack dip, soon as I dipped a piece of tater tot into it, I seriously was hooked! must go there again soon!!!!"
1,"12.24.13.\n\nFrom the reviews that show up in the side bar while I'm writing this, I guess our experience was not too far off the mark.\n\nAt first, it looked like things were going to go smoothly without a hitch. As a frequent customer and booking ahead of time, we were able to go directly to the garage to pick-up a car. When we approached the attendant window in the garage area, there was surprisingly no line. They directed us to stand to the left of the little booth; we just had one other customer in front of us.\n\nWe stood there for a few minutes and the line at the booth grew significantly...but now they were directing people to the right of the booth...and they were being helped first! Finally, one of the car people came to our line (after helping a handful of people from the other line).\n\nThankfully, this employee had noticed that we had been waiting patiently, when we had all the right to complain, and apologized repeatedly. If anything, he was probably the best part of the experience because he seemed sincere and gave us no attitude. He even offered to upgrade our car choice.\n\nBottom line though, bad service and they should hire more people to man this area. This trip was during Thanksgiving time so they should have planned for the influx of customers/travelers.\n\nYelp 365 Challenge: #357/365"
3,"I've NEVER been happy to pay more than $4 for a 'grande'-sized latte... until I tried this place. It's on my way to the office, and I decided to give it a try. As already noted by other Yelpers, this place roasts its own beans, on site. I got a vanilla latte and wow... this is not Starbucks. This was a cuppa POW, right in the kisser. Loved it! You should check it out. =)"
1,Expensive burger(18 dollars) with little taste. Service was very poor-not even napkins or flatware offered at the bar. Beer tasteless. Disappointing. Busy place.
3,"So I have been wanting to find a gym that I feel \""comfortable\"" and have great hours.  Well, this gym pretty much did this for me.\n\nThe fact that it is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year is great so you can go anytime you want.  The only down side- this place is packed constantly.  I am still trying to find a time where its less busy, but when you live in Las Vegas- I doubt that is possible.\n\nThey have a women's only gym on the first floor as well as a weight room that I have only seen dudes in.  They have massive amounts of cardio machines on the top floor as well as rooms for instructor classes.  From what I remember you can go to any classes for free and you can meet with a trainer (once a month) for free.  Pretty nice.  \n\nI'm on a challenge right now- going to the gym everyday for the next 3 weeks (before I make a trip) so if you see me- say hello! :)"
2,I do love their ticket waiting system so we don't have to wait in line for hours. When we arrived at 4:30pm thinking the line will be shorter we later found out we have to take a ticket and return on the time it tells us to which was 6pm. Not thrilled about it but better than standing in line.\nWe dined at the Wynn and Bellagio buffet so we though this should be similar price and quality. $140 for 2 people!!! It almost made me want to walk away!\nFood quality and selection is good but $70 a person is still a lot for a buffet. I will suggest you to come try it once but be prepared for the ticket shock. \nI know some people compare the price with a fine dinning restaurant and think it's a good price but I compare it with other Vegas buffet and think it's not worth the wait and the money.
1,ok food but most of it is frozen or canned and the ribs gave me the shits.
1,"I wonder how their steak is here but don't EVER come here for happy hour with a big group. No joke. \n\nI came here the other day with a pretty big group for happy hour. The service was horrible, the food and drinks were mediocre. For drinks, I ordered the Orange Slice to start. It was a martini but tasted like a screwdriver with a splash of vodka. My second drink was the Pinot Noir. This one I liked. For food, we ordered the crab cakes, nachos and baked brie. The cheese on the nachos was really dry and didn't taste very fresh to me. I actually liked the baked brie. The cheese and pesto that it came with was really good. \n\nService.. I've never been a waitress and I understand we were with a big group but I would think you would go around the whole group asking what everyone wanted. Plus there were 2-3 waitresses helping with our group. Never once did that happen. We basically had to flag down the waitress every time we wanted to order something. On top of that, we asked her for the happy hour menu maybe 3 times or more and she never once brought it. We ended up talking to the manager who eventually brought the menu and told him we were very disappointed in the service. We got an apology. I would've thought he could've at least gave us a small discount on the bill, or something complimentary. Anything. Nope. I won't be back for happy hour."
2,"Alright, already, the show goes on\nAll night 'til the morning, we dream so long\nAnybody ever wonder when they would see the sun go\nJust remember when you come up, the show goes on...at MUNCHBAR! - Lupe Fiasco (the show goes on)\n\nLocated right next to PURE nightclub, this 24 hr joint is a life-saver for ppl staying at Caesars. Their jalepeno burger is really good, their fries are less than average, and their nachos are good for the first few bites then everything tastes the same. The fact that this place is open 24 hrs though is a huge plus and they have enough tvs for you to enjoy your favorite team.  \n\nFood: 3 stars --- Service: 3 stars --- Atmosphere: 4 stars --- Price(value): 3.5 stars"
3,Radical dive bar. I get drunk here sometimes.
0,"Food was overpriced and arrived cold after over an hour since ordering. Was flavorless and mushy. Didn't even finish it. Will not order again, at least not delivery. Maybe it's better fresh at the restaurant but doubt it... Disappointing."
0,"flavors suck, managment sucks, there were kids eating like pigs, never again will i go there"
2,"Was there for a gathering and they gave us free nachos and quesadillas. Everyone was quite helpful and friendly. Some of the drinks took a while to show, but overall was very happy with experience there. Would return."
3,"OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...\n\nReview #7:\nthis was a pleasant surprise; after touring the casino area, which to me has a bit of an outdated feel (even though the Strat only dates back to 1996), I wasn't too impressed and was ready to give it a \""3\"" rating at best; but then found a pretty good place to eat called McCall's Heartland Grill, and a semi-decent shopping level (who knew?); but the clear drawing card here is the tower (duh!); first of all, go outside on the street level and look up at it - very impressive!; then just tell them that you're going up to one of the bars (107 Lounge or AirBar) and you get a fast elevator ride, from which you can even access the outdoor observation deck for free; truly amazing 360 degree views of the valley; and you can watch the lunatics bungee jumping and going on the crazy rides; I easily spent an hour up here; best craft brew bet = few & far between, but McCall's has a few on tap"
3,"Worth the money. Great views with portholes periodically in the \""fencing\"" for your camera. Try to time your trip up so you see the Bellagio water fountain show across the way."
3,Great spot if you are looking for late night (or early AM) korean grub.  Walked over from Cosmo (took about 15 mins) on 12/31 10am.  Service is typical korean.  You have to holla (or push the button) to get their attention.  They understand both english and korean.  Food is good but pretty pricey.  Kalbi is $35...bulgogi is $24... But I would pay anything to get my cravings met.  The 4 stars is mainly for the availability and lack of competition for this restaurant.
2,"I came here for breakfast with our friend's family's recommendation. Overall the food was okay and service was pretty good. I ordered the Victorian Crapes with strawberries and Nutella. Again food was good but I felt hungry after finishing my dish. Wish I ordered extra crape. My friend's Benedict looked more filling, she liked it okay but not the best, she said. It was good place for us to have breakfast that day as place was pretty empty so we were able to stay as long as we wanted, without being rushed."
2,"I can finally say that I've been to the elusive Eagle's Crest in the sticks of northeast Madison. \n\nTwo days later, I am still struggling to digest the burger I consumed on Sunday morning. They don't even glamorize this real-deal burger with 16oz beef, 8 strips bacon and a think layer of melty cheese for $8. I can't even see how they make money.\n\nIs it the best burger in Madison? I don't think so. It's not very well seasoned and the massive amount of meat is hard to handle. Is it an adventure in fun townie bar that has good cocktails? Yes."
0,"I would like to thank our fabulous bartender whose name rhymes with Bristina... for being an incompetent, unfriendly, and arrogant bartender. Village pub usually has good service but I appreciate the amazing treatment we received. I didn't know we were at Dick's...on purpose. Get em girl! If she's not there 3.8 stars, her there -.8."
4,This food is amazing try the Al Pastor...and the Agua frescas so yummy the best in town! we also used them to cater a recent event and it was such a hit! and the prices are so resonable
1,"Omg no discount for locals or club cards. Food was old and crusty. And for 15 dollars a person for lunch. McDonalds would of been better. Thanks Palms tou always said \""locals first\""... i will never ever come here again. Just gross!"
2,"It is nice to see such a large roller rink still around although there is a lot that can be improved here.  First the good.\n\nThe parties are reasonably priced.  The skates are in pretty good shape, the music is current and loud and the dj changes it up a bit so the skaters aren't always skating around with no goal. \n\nThe places for improvement - the parties are very disorganized and with the exception of food deliveries you are pretty much on your own.  I really would have liked to see a staff member available to give beginners a 10 minute group lesson as part of the party as several members of the party had no idea how to skate and ended up staying off the rink.\n\nAlso, they have no water at the counter except really wierd tasting tap water.  I don't care if you want to charge me 2 dollars for a small bottle of water, you should have something for people who do not want the sugary drinks.\n\nThe staff is very friendly when you speak with them although they seemed a bit disorganized.  \nThey do have wifi.\nStay away from the air hockey machine until it is fixed."
2,"A solid and reliable wee sandwich shop, Wee Bite is nestled just off the Royal Mile, on St Mary's Street. It's simple and straightforward and chases hunger away unfussily, so if that's what you're after, this is the place for you.\n\nOverall, we said: \""I thought Wee Bite was pretty good. It's not going to set the heather on fire, but in terms of dealing with your lunchtime hunger in a fashion that will leave you feeling satisfied, I think it showed that it was more than capable of doing so. Cost wise, it's probably priced for it's proximity to the Royal Mile, so doesn't represent fantastic value, but I'd happily pop in again if I find myself in the neighbourhood.\"""
0,"Bank of America was my first bank after switching from a credit union. I banked with them for a couple years. a few months after I turned 18 they told me in the branch that I was approved for a student credit card to be used for overdraft protection. I thought that was great bc I was still learning to balance a checkbook and hardly ever had more than $200 in my account at a time. I filled out all the paper work and the teller said it would be applied right away as a back up.\n\nWell, that didn't happen. I overdrafted several times thinking it would pull it from my card and ended up with almost $300 in overdraft fees. \n\nI went into the bank and they had no idea what I was talking about with that student credit card, and had no record of my paperwork or even saying that i would like them to open it.  \n\nshe then explained to me that my paper work have been misplaced. this is when i freaked out.\n\nTHEY MISPLACED my social, my address, name everything for anyone to be able to steal my identity. they have no record of ever having it and said i should be fine bc it was probably shredded if it was found. ya, not if a criminal found it! \n\nI then had to put a bunch of red flags on my social so that no one could do anything with my name or ss#. \n\nThey wouldn't waive any of the fees bc they didn't think it was their fault. I paid them off and switched banks and i will never bank with them for anything ever again."
2,"Fun place to eat,good waiter service,great spot location....specially when u are starving and have no time to waist looking for something...:)"
3,"I used to dine in but now mostly run in during lunch time and grab a to-go box.  The selection is always fresh.  On several occasions, the food handlers have cooked me a special batch of whatever I asked for that was either low or almost finished.  (Just last week the food handler had the cook make me 6 fresh sesame balls since it was close to dinner time, there were only 2 left in the serving dish, and they don't typically offer them to the dinner crowd.) One of my favorite lunch stops during the week."
0,"I was new to Queen Creek and needed a cut.  Hair dresser was indifferent, didn't cut my bangs very well.  I have never experienced a salon where they don't even dry your hair after they cut it.  I left with soaking wet hair.  Most places dry it to check their work.  Won't return and don't recommend."
3,"Finally there is a actual \""burger stand\"" in Las Vegas... This divey little, and I mean tiny, place is a diamond in the rough on Las Vegas blvd... On a road with some of the most expensive burgers in the works the under 8$ burger holds it's own!!   When you get there do not be dissuaded by the appearance of the place go in and get the burger... It's a simple place with a simple menu founded on my of my fav restaurant rules \""do less better\""   These guys are all about that and it shows when you open the greasy box filled with delicious burger and fresh cut Idaho potato fries!!  One other note to consider they are very generous with he toppings.  So if you don't like something on your burger like mustard... Make you you ask them to hold it off...\n\nBottom line:\nDon't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a restaurant by its exterior!   And try this burger"
1,"After arriving in Vegas, we went straight here to run in, hopefully see someone, and leave. They were taping the show when we arrived, the bouncer told us it would be 20 min and we'd get in.  So we waited, and we waited, and we waited.  I'm from Kansas...it's hot in the summer yes, but this is the desert.  I am SO glad there's the guy with the pop up shop because I drank 3 bottles of water before we got to go in 2 hours later.  We saw Rick walk by SUPER quick and that's it.  We heard they don't like to be \""seen\"" anymore.  There was so many people in there you couldn't see much...kind of a waste of time."
0,"Im not sure how people call it clean! DIRTY!!!!! DISGUSTING!!!! DIRTY!!!!! Small, dirty, hot, disgusting place! No AC, just a ceiling fan. The food is OK if you like grease! I ordered a steak quesadilla and the grease was running down my hands. The portions are huge, prices are low. Nevertheless, I will not go there again."
4,"Vegas is the land of horrible music.  Frankie's Tiki Room bar saved us from night filled with Celene Dion and The Black Eyed Peas. Frankie's is an authentic Tiki Bar off the strip.  It's dimly lit, with illuminated puffer fish hanging from the ceiling, and surf music loaded on the jukebox. \n\nThe drink menu is a mix of Frankie's own signature cocktails and the traditional Tiki Bar fare.  They do not have food and their drinks are boozey so make sure you get a bite to eat if you plan on spending some time here.\n\nThe cocktails were delicious (I had a Mai Tai, a Zombie and Kahiki Kai) and quite strong.  The menu has a skull rating system denoting the strength of each drink, so you do know what you're getting yourself into.\n\nThe vibe was comfortable and mellow, and surprisingly quiet for 1:00 on a Friday night.  The whole experience made me long to live on a tropical island with sexy hula ladies and cocktail in hand, for the moment I'll have to settle for another trip to Frankies when I'm back out west."
2,Random crazy crackheads wander throughout this place. The staff isn't incredibly helpful and this place makes me miss the awesomeness that is Freddy's in Portland. Need more natural foods! Damn you red state AZ!!!!
3,"This place is awesome.  A upbeat cool atmosphere with boho chic furnishings outside.  The menu is small but with enough to lure the varietal tastes of my party of 4. I had the roasted salmon and the compliment of quinoa, apples and jicama made this dish simply awesome.  Culinary Dropouts is my new favorite place."
2,Ah. Disappointing. Small portions. Boring poorly seasoned Japanese chow from 1995. Same old. Will not return.
3,"I like the idea of this place more than the actual place.  In theory they could have Apple computers at steep discounts and furniture mad cheap that the university doesn't need anymore that I could possibly give a second life.  Unfortunately the stuff they don't need is normally old dell computers, old mac's and about 1000 file cabinets.  So most the time its crap, but when a dept gets in some cash they update computers and stuff so if you lucky at random times throughout the year you can get an Intel iMac for under 600 dollars which isn't bad at all or you can get a bike that is left in the bike racks on campus for between 50-75 which is actually really good!  If you need a cheap bike in pretty good shape DEF hit this place up otherwise its really hit and miss.  I'm glad it exists I just wish there was more cool stuff ALL THE TIME... that being said I'll drop by this week sometime again either way."
3,"I really enjoy this place. When I lived on the other side of town (Trop&Pecos) I went to their other location pretty frequently. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was long wait times. It wasn't exceptionally busy, there was just a lot of chatter between staff. I understand. It's slow. No worries but that's why I'm not giving 5 stars. Service was good, it was just lack of communication."
3,"I was so surprised that Famous Uncle Al's was a franchise! I thought it was just a local mom and pop shop.. Anyway, I recently visited with my uncle and my little sister. I ordered the italian beef, my uncle got the patty melt and fries, lil sis ordered chili fries and a corn dog. My italian beef was delicious! I really loved the bread, the sauce, the sweet peppers. I paired my meal with the delicious french fries and a cherry pepsi. It was an awesome combo! Very affordable and friendly service."
2,"Okay, its an institution...the burgers are okay, the clientele more authentic, but what the hell, you got someplace better to go?  Didn't think so, have a Miller and shut up.  Oh, sorry, fell into character there, just go and have a burger and beer, you'll be happy.  If not, its no skin off my...  Oops, there I go again, see what this place does to you?!"
3,Very good food for a pleasantly not absurd price.  The setting was surprisingly pleasant for a mall.
1,Nastiest food I have ever had.
1,"I heard this place is similar to Chipotle.  Believe it or not we have never been to Chipotle. My wife nd got us both a Rumba Burrito with shreded beef (that was tender but not real flavorful), beans, rice and mango salsa.\n\nIts not the best Mexican food,  that's because it is a fast food type restaurant. It is clean, has large portions, clean tables, decent prices. with plenty of parking. What more can you ask for?\n\nAs stated in another one of my earlier reviews regarding Mexican food. \""I pretty much judge a Mexican restaurant on how their salsa tastes\"". Cafe Rumba's mild red salsa was to my suprise tasty. Their mango salsa was simply awesome. My only complaint was there wasn't enough of either one of them. \n\nFOOD: Super sized and fulfilling. They made sure you did not go home un-satisfied and hungry. PRICE: The prices were good for what you got! SERVICE: Staff was nice, and the service was up to par AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like a typical fast food restaurant. CONCLUSION: Limited, Straight forward menu. It's not the greatest food / restaurant but definitely not the worst. I'll give them another try for sure."
4,"Seriously good pizza. The Tartufo is my favorite, have to order it every time we visit. They take great care in baking the pizza to perfection, can't get enough of the Neapolitan crust. The carpaccio is also really good, unlike any I've had before. The staff is always friendly and helpful. We love this place and will keep coming back."
4,"My favorite breakfast place to go to when I roll out of bed. Very busy on weekends, but had like a 5 minute wait. I love the atmosphere; busy noises everywhere but able to feel cozy with my cup of coffee. Food is amazing! So many choices and categories of food. I usually get anything that comes with their potatoes. \n\nService is wonderful! Servers are so attentive and never had a let down here yet. \n\nObviously coming back whenever I have the chance."
4,"On the food alone, Scarpetta is probably a four star restaurant. But with the spectacular space it occupies (Cosmopolitan Hotel, overlooking the Bellagio fountains), it gets the five star nod from me. \n\nThe perfect ambience is hard to ignore. Unbelievably swanky, Scarpetta just oozes Vegas. Dimly lit, white linens, dark wood and interesting light fixtures mix to create a very upscale atmosphere. \n\nFood wise, I enjoyed two appetizers: the pea soup and sea scallops. The soup excelled where other dishes didn't in that the pea flavor wasn't showed up by the cream. For the other appetizer that made up my one 'entree', I found my scallops to be cooked near-perfectly, but one of them suffered from too much char, rather than a nice caramelization. There was also a too-gratuitous use of garnishes, from radish, to micro greens, to apples and more. Less would've been more when the scallops are served with truffles white asparagus. \n\nThe dishes our friends had all received the same comment: heavy. While its summer and seeing the words 'summer truffles' on multiple dishes is never a bad thing, all those dishes all felt so heavy with butter and/or cream. \n\nI would be remiss if I didn't cap this review with a mention of the bread. Served with dishes containing citrus-infused olive oil, cold eggplant spread and a mascarpone butter, the bread itself was out of this world good (though also heavy, as it's laced with a thin slice of salami and cheese). \n\nI can't say that my Scarpetta experience didn't live up to the hype. However, like much of Vegas, there was a sliver of feeling that the food itself didn't quite live up to the glitz and glamor of the restaurant itself."
1,"I was pretty excited to try this place.  I love quick, healthy food.  I was disappointed.  My cole slaw was super soggy and loaded with mayo.  I asked for no mustard on my club pita and it had mustard.  The pita was hard around the edges.  \n\nI am willing to give it another try.  Or maybe another location.  It could have been just a rare bad day.\n\nThe service was friendly."
1,"Am I missing something? I almost feel like the odd ball for not loving this place. Came here on a Sunday sometime around 11AM - 12PM and it was PACKED. It's been at least a good 5 months since I've had pho, last time being in Houston. So I got to share my first Vegas pho experience with Pho So 1. Seeing the crowd, I was sure I was at the right place. \n\nWell... not so much. We got sat within 15 minutes and you can immediately tell the waitress threw restaurant hospitality out the window and just wanted to quickly get our orders and out of here to turn the table over (...that's the expression right? sounds weird right now..). Anyway my parents ordered regular pho with everything you can think of in it and I ordered Bun Bo Hue. \n\nBoth broths were extremely watered down with no flavor that could satisfy ANYONE's taste buds. Bun Bo Hue is typically supposed to be a tad bit reddish with the chili oil but mine looked murky brown. So sad because I was really craving some good Bun Bo Hue :'[\n\nHm, I'll have to give this place a second chance and go with something my fellow Yelpers ordered. In the meantime, anyone have any other good pho restaurant suggestions?"
2,"I've been here twice, the soup was ok.  I got the beef, the meat seemed a little bit too fatty and overcooked maybe.  I haven't really had pho much, it could just be that I am not a big fan of it.  The service was very fast and friendly, I appreciated that, and my coworkers seemed to enjoy their meals."
2,"Do you ever get a craving and you just need to satisfy that craving??  \nOne Saturday evening my daughter and I saw a commercial for pie on TV. She said \""mom, let's get some pie\"".....who am I to ignore that request??  So off we went.  \n\nWe have been here a couple of times and it is clean and the service is friendly.  The food is nothing spectacular but it's good if you want a quick bite.  Now the pie....well, the pie is pretty good.  I have had chocolate cream, peanut butter and chocolate, and lemon cream cheese.  All have been good and fresh.  And it satisfied a craving.  What more could you ask for?"
1,"Was ok, broth pretty good, tasty wings, but when I go they are CHEAP on the beef, like 4 wimpy slices, and charged $4 more for 4 more slices! Other times when I go with people who are regulars service and portions are great. Playing favorites at a restaurant isnt for me."
3,"This place was awesome. I would definitely go back. I had the pozole and it was really good. I also had a green chili fry bread taco. That was delicious. The only thing I would suggest is not to order the red menudo. I had it and I didnt know what to... The red sauce was made from enchilada sauce.  I did not enjoy it, but the rest of it was terrific. I dont have to wait for the state fair to have fry bread. YEAY!"
0,"I came to the restaurant for Sunday brunch. I called to make reservations and was told that they only do walk it's but the wait was 20 mins. Cool. I get to the door 15 minutes later and the wait turns into 45 minutes. At this point I was starving so I asked to sit at the bar.\n\nThe bar was pretty big and had about 3 couples sitting down. I saw a few open tables which made me question why there was a 45 minute wait. Any who, it takes about 15 minutes for the bartender to ask for my drink order. I mentioned that I was ready to order my food as well since I was more than ready to eat, and she asked if I could wait. I then noticed that she was the only bar tender in the restaurant serving not only the bar and our orders, but making all of the bottomless mimosas for the entire restaurant. Therefore it took 40 minutes for my food to come out and my order was wrong. I had to ask for a manager to rush my order because it was getting ridiculous. I ate an hour later with 1 mimosa, in which one of the managers had to run to the store to buy more champagne..... \n\nI will never dine here again. Good luck with those Groupons out there, the staffing is terrible and the food isn't ANYthing special. Our bartender was working very hard might I say. She had black hair with tattoos."
4,"Best Chinese lunch spot hands down! Fast, fresh and super friendly spot to eat in Summerlin. $6 lunch special comes with egg drop soup, wontons, drink, entree, rice and noodles! So bomb!"
3,"what can I say about this place? It's damn good.. one server in the place but she had two people helping her.. She has it down tho..I watched her go from table to table taking orders and answering question about the menu..\n\nHer answer to the food.. \""ITS BOMB\"".. and it definitely was.\n\na \""half order \"" of bulgogi nachos can feed two..\nbulgogi tacos\nand a bulgogi burrito.\ntasted all three..all were \""BOMB\""\n\nI can't wait to go back again.. that is all."
2,"The pizza isn't the greatest in the world, but it will do....especially when it's all you can eat for $7!  My friend lives around the corner, so he recommended coming here for lunch.\n\nI didn't know what to expect, but was happy to find a really clean place.  The restaurant was about 1/2 full during lunchtime on a Tuesday.  On the buffet line you will find at least 12 to 15 different pizzas.  Since I love Pizza and can eat it morning, noon, and night I was in heaven.  I was about to screw up all of my efforts from the morning workout.\n\nHere's a list of what I can remember eating...the slices are small, so it's not as much as it appears...although it was a lot!\n\nPepperoni - Regular Crust\nPepperoni - Thick Crust\nPepperoni - Thin Crust\nPepperoni & Jalapenos\nMacaroni & Cheese - Yes, it's a pizza!  It was just ok though.\nHam & Cheese\nVeggie Thin Crust\nMushroom & Pepperoni\nPepperoni & Sausage\n\nThere were many others that I didn't try.....BBQ Chicken, Hawaiian, and several I can't remember.  Overall, it was great value for the money.\n\nThe people who work here are very friendly too.  They greeted everyone who entered the door & everyone who left.....and it sounded sincere not fake.\n\nThere was a small selection of video games & other games in the back room and tv's.\n\nWill I come back?  When I want to gain 500 lbs....yes!"
1,"Just had breakfast there today. Not too happy with this place. Place being a breakfast place does not offer jam and/or jelly unless you offer to pay an additional charge (.75). No flavor syrup unless it comes with the meal and/or you offer to pay another additional charge of 75 cents. Place has a great decore except the lights bulbs are out ing every fixrure and maybe because they didn't have time to clean the glass on the fixtures. Very noisy. Don't think I'll be back any time too soon. Did it once. Over it - \""whatever\""."
4,"This is the best Korean BBQ place I have ever been to.  The wife and I came with 2 friends at about 3 in the morning after a night of partying.  There is no all u can eat at this time. \n\nI don't remember what we ordered.  What I do remember was how good the meal was. The sauces, the fresh meat, the veggies.  All were fantastic.  One of the best parts of the meal is when they bring the rice out at the end and make fried rice with all the scraps on the grill.  Your usually full at that point, but you can't resist the rice goodness. \n\nI will definitely be back.  Especially for the all u can eat. I can't wait."
2,I went here with colleagues while in Vegas for a conference. We made a reservation through opentable but when we showed up they didn't have our name. Luckily they had a table available. The service was a little slow but the waiter had good recommendations while checking out the menu. He even persuaded me against one dish vs another because of other patron's dissatisfaction. I ended up choosing the Miso Sea bass and it was fantastic.  Everything was fresh and the bread service was baked on site as well.  It's a good quiet place for a nice dinner off the strip in Vegas.
4,This is THE place for donut-lovers in Madison.  Cannot speak more highly of this place and their old-fashioneds.  Just such a treat.
3,Great value. Good food. Love the pasta station. Not quite a wynn or bellagio style buffet but its also much cheaper and its a great deal.
4,"The guys at the automotive service department are amazing! I got a spontaneous flat around 2:00 this afternoon. I put the donut on and immediately began calling tire places around the area to do a tire repair. Everyone was busy all week (2 Wal-Marts, a CAA, and an independent tire place). This location of Canadian Tire was the only place who said they were booked all day and for the rest of the week, but then offered to have me drop it off and they would try to find time to squeeze me in today or tomorrow. So I dropped it off and the guy at the counter (Jim) made a note saying to try to have it done by 4:30 that day! Then I called in around 4:55 since I hadn't heard from them, and another gentleman (Gary) said that they had repaired it and that they had thought I was coming in and 4:30. I explained that Jim had said they would call me because he didn't know if they would get to it today for sure. Gary apologized and even though they were closing in 5 minutes, told me to come down and they would take care of me! So nice! Great service! They only charged me for the new valve (it had a fault valve)! These guys were amazing!!!\n\nP.S. I have no idea what this Vincent guy has an issue with, personally. This location is the closest to my house at only a 5 minute drive away... It would be far if you lived far away, but that's true for anything... There's a PetSmart, Winners, Beer Store, Shoppers, and other shops all around it, and the Boardwalk is only a block away. Not sure what more people could want, really..."
2,"Is it normal for \""Thai-style chicken\"" to look like pineapple? \n\nJust got back from lunch with my co-worker.  It was nearby, had decent reviews and I wanted Chinese. My co-worker, whose Chinese, jumped at the opportunity to go to a new place for lunch nearby since she usually only goes to places her friends recommend.  Overall - it was ok-good. Staff was friendly - suggested what I try. Co-Worker (CW) was excited about the Thai menu. She'd been talking about Hot & Sour soup and hasn't found any in PHX she likes except one place in the far away land of Chandler (compared to West PHX). \n\nHOneslty, she seemed a little disappointed in the food. Hot & Sour soup (from the Chinese menu, not the Thai H&S) was sour, but not hot. She had me try, and I'm no hot & sour judge, but it had some funky (read: not good) taste to it. They brought a wonton and egg roll with her #7 Thai combo (can't remember what it was called). Both were overfried. She mentioned it's like it was fried then refried. HOWEVER, the insides of the egg roll were quite tasty. Wonton- not so much. Corn soup came with my #1 Pad Thai lunch special...it was broth with corn. Very simple. I suppose I expected a little more but it was exactly what they said, corn soup. I should have gotten a salad. \n\nMoving on to the actual lunch. Pad Thai, I've never had much Thai food and I enjoyed this quite a bit. Now I can't compare this to anything else so it's just my taste buds talking. Is it normal for the chicken to look like pineapple? That threw me off - it was cubed and had a yellow-ish tint. It was very soft too - gave me a weird I like/don't like feeling. But i continued to eat and overall, I liked it. \n\nMy CW got the #7 Thai special that came in a bowl. Had lots of veggies, chicken in some creamy spicy sauce. She had me try the sauce and it was pretty good (I wish I had taken more to put on my meal from her bowl when she offered). I'm not so sure she enjoyed the place as much and I'm not surprised. At the end of our meal she mentioned she'd like to find a \""really good\"" Chinese place to take us to and was going to talk to her friends. \n\nI wouldn't mind going back to try the Chinese menu - they have a huge selection and it's nearby, a great price for lunch, not busy and pretty friendly."
4,"Oh man, why haven't I tried this place any sooner?! The rolls here are as good as my favorite places in Cali. The sauces weren't too overpowering, there was just enough rice,  the sashimi was thick and fresh *melt in your mouth* quality. I would say the price is about average or slightly higher than other places, but for the quality and creativity of the food, I think it's so worth it. We ordered 6 rolls that came out to about $80 (not including tips). The chef was a chill guy and our waitress was very attentive. Also like the vibe here because they play a lot of edm. Good music, good food, good service. I will definitely be coming back!"
1,"I was craving beef kaldereta. So I searched up; filipino restaurants. There wasn't much of an option because it was late at night. Salo Salo grill was the only choice I had. Anyways, I walked in, expecting it to be busy but it wasn't. Not too many people. Only three tables were occupied. I did take out and ordered beef kaldereta, buko pandan, honey BBQ and garlic rice. If you order a main course, it doesn't come with rice so you have to pay for rice too. The pictures that you see of buko pandan is no where near close to how much they gave me. It was in a much SMALLER container. The pictures of the menu and prices on here; are not up to date. The prices has gone up. Let's get to the food. Shall we? The beef kaldereta wasn't what I was expecting. It had a different taste to it. I don't know, I can't explain it. I can't really compare real filipino authentic food VS the Americanized philipino food because I was raised in the US my whole life. But I was born in the phillipines. Although my parents and my whole family always cook filipino food. Moving on to the garlic rice; it was a lot. I had better. It didn't have much of a strong flavor for me. I felt like it was a hint of garlic. You can barely even taste it. And as for the honey BBQ goes... It was eh. Will I ever come back? Not sure. After reading the reviews people posted of how this restaurant was given a C on the health dept and dirty dining... Kind of scared me away."
3,"Went there for a business dinner. All of the meals were great, good wine list. The bananas foster dessert was amazing."
4,"These folks used to get knocked for being a bit unfriendly, but in the last year they genuinely seem to like their customers coming in the door. Much more pleasant to shop there now. Very good selection, and fast service. It is a true blessing that they have a store in the middle of nowhere, where I happen to live."
0,"I can maybe understand giving Pink Taco one star because the tacos I had were actually really good.  However I really wish I paid more attention to the verbal reviews I received that warned me against eating here.  For, despite enjoying the flavor of the carnitas tacos while I ate them, the price I paid for the next 36 hours of gastro-intestinal misery was far from worth the few moments of guacamole deliciousness.  \n\nNormally, I would just attribute my digestion issues to residual side effects from drinking a yards worth of margarita composed of the absolute best of the bottom shelf alcohols, but when everyone else in my party started canceling their plans for their last night in Vegas in exchange for a bed/bathroom/pepto/alka-seltzer combination, my powers of deduction left me no other choice than to blame pink taco.\n\nI don't think I'll eat here again.  Las Vegas has too many other amazingly fantastic places to eat. FIN"
0,Poor service !!! \n Cold appetizers ( frozen) lack luster attitude from staff . \n Will not come back !  Get better service from sizzler.
0,"atrocious lines, poorly planned. if you thought the roosevelt food truck festival was bad, this one sucked! i'm going to try to get my money back from groupon!"
0,"All of my Culture Pass issues were taken care of by contacting Act One directly. They have called and explained to Amanda, and hopefully all other employees of this branch, how a Culture Pass works."
2,"Hey, when thinking about buffets on the strip, most are about the same. Bayside was literally right in the middle. The selection was, of course, huge. Quality of food was spotty, but they literally had a little of everything. Not a particularly pretty restaurant, but they have unlimited beer/wine/champagne. At $35/person, it's not a bad deal if you're hungry and wanna get your drink on :)"
2,"Just learned about this place from today's Groupon deal ($20 worth of food for $10!). I will definitely hit this place up in the next few days and update my review.\n\n-----\n12-18-2010\nDropped by Blue Ox Tavern after hanging on to the $20 for $10 Groupon promotion thing that I bought awhile back.  Had intended to come by on a Sunday when the Vikings were playing and enjoy the food and atmosphere, but that unfortunately never pan out with the work schedule.  Anyway, I came on a slow Saturday night, and the place was pretty empty (just a few guests, a bar tender and waitress and whoever was working in the kitchen).\n\nTheir menu is pretty simple.  Most items were under $10.  after checking out the menu, I decided to get a cup of their Soup of the Day, some Chicken Fingers and a burger with 2x 1/2 lb Angus beef patties.  Oh and a soda.  The whole meal came out to be $22 plus change.  Not bad at all.\n\nThe Chicken Finger was nice and hot and was pretty good (a bit too salty for me, but once it gets a quick dunk in the dipping sauce it was fine).  The burger was juicy and packed a lot of calories.  Had I forced myself to finish it, it would have qualified for a 1#er burger challenge.  But I opted to finish my soup and chicken fingers, and left the last 3 bites for the dumpster.\n\nThe waitress was cool.  Took my order and pretty much left me alone, except to bring the food and check on my Coke for refills.  I pretty much planted myself in front of the TV and watch the 1st Qtr of the college football game that was on at the time.\n\nI think this is a good place to get decent bar food at a reasonable price.  The place is likely packed when one of the MN sports team is playing and being televised, but I was not there during one of those times.  The bartender was pretty funny, so if you are bored he will definitely be able to entertain you.\n\nFood: 3/5\nPrice: 4/5\nService: 3/5\nDecor: 3/5"
0,"I walked up to two sales associates who were talking and asked about a screen cover. One of them showed me to them and in the middle of talking to me, began helping another customer. I still wanted to get it installed but upon asking his reply was \""I'm busy now. Take a look at our phone cases.\"" There was not even a redirect to someone who could've helped me. So I left and went to Fry's."
2,"Went in for their \""Buy One, Take One\"" promotion and let me say its a flippin joke! They use the cheapest, most rubbery pasta they can find. Definitely not the same pasta/ingredients used for dishes on the regular menu. Couldn't believe how tasteless my food was, and afraid to eat my \""take home\"" dish. \n\nNonetheless, this restaurant is nearest to my home and is usually delish."
2,"loved it, ate there twice in 1 week. i loved the pasta station the most, the meatballs were to die for. salad bar was typical the mexican on the other hand was a big yuck. the taquitos were realy grose, iv had better from a box out of the freezer section and i dont think the gaumolie was store bough because iv had fresh, and that was not fresh. but not a bad price, the food is over all pretty good."
3,"Great food.  The vegetarian lasagna was unlike anything I've ever had and I would love to get a hold of it again.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the bleu cheese clouds on top were amazing.  \n\nThe service is amazing, as you would expect at a place like this.  The wine list is overwhelming; use the electronic menu if they offer it.\n\nThe decor is a little austere for my tastes, but I suppose that is typical of the higher end restaurants where things like \""themes\"" and \""warmth\"" appear tacky."
4,My boyfriend and I went on the food tour this past weekend. We weren't sure what to expect. Vickie and Evan took us on a tour through downtown Las Vegas giving us historical facts along with pictures about Las Vegas. I'm a native and had no idea about the history of my home. We were taken to several shops and business that were hidden treasures. They accommodated my special diet consisting of no pork. They allowed us to ask questions and answered them without hesitation. I would recommend this tour for anyone of any age. It was a great experience!
3,Fair prices.  Consistent Octane rating.  I've never been inside.  Also I think this station is very busy so the premium my car burns always seems to go a little further on a tank from here.  Not sure why but I also always get 20 more miles out of a tank if I fill up here instead of getgo or costco.
0,"Thursday, April 5\n\nThe next morning we decided to try out the \""Caf\u00e9\"" in the Casino. There was a line to be seated though we could see more than twenty unoccupied tables. The service after being seated was fine but the food was atrocious. I love pancakes and these were hands down the worst pancakes I have ever had. A child with a can of bisquick could have done a better job.\n\nAt approximately 11:00 am, we receive a phone call that our king room is ready. It is right next door (10-120). Our electronic keys have been reprogrammed and we can go ahead and move rooms as soon as we are ready.\n\nMy boyfriend checks that his key opens the door and we move our suitcases into our new room. I immediately notice that there are peanuts, gum wrappers, and hair balls all over the floor. Additionally, there are black marks on the sheets. Disgusted my boyfriend decides to go down to speak to guest services/a manager. He comes back about twenty minutes later and informs me that he spoke with a manager and was told that he had two choices:\n\n1) We could move to a cleaner room while they cleaned our room\n2) They would send housekeeping up immediately\n\nHe had opted for the second choice and management compensated him two days of resort fees ($40). We waited to get ready for a group dinner for about two hours. Finally we had little choice and started to prep ourselves for dinner. We again noticed that the bathroom fan did not work. This time, instead of mold on the grout lines, the shower ceiling was peeling. At 4:30 pm housekeeping had not shown up; we left for our evening out.\n\nWe came back to the room at about 11:00 p.m. The room was still not cleaned. The same wrappers, food, and hair were still on the floor. My boyfriend called down to guest services. They apologized and stated that they were unsure why housekeeping never came to the room. The compensated him the remaining three days of resort fees ($60) and then asked if we'd like someone to come up and clean the room. After a long day of drinking and dancing, we wanted to go to bed.\n\n\nFriday, April 6\n\nI had an early morning class. When I returned around noon the room was not clean. I also couldn't help but hear the absolute worst techno music emanating from the pool ten stories down. \n\nWhen I went to dinner and out dancing until after 9:00 pm; upon return the room was not clean. At 11:20 pm, housekeeping came into our room while we sleeping. (Don't judge me, I was tired!)\n\n\nSaturday, April 7\n\nThe room is finally cleaned! But I start to notice odd things. Where did one of my red extensions go? Why did my bottle of Frangelico move from the table near the window to the bedside table? I assumed it was due to housekeeping needing to move things around to clean thoroughly. We also happen to notice that housekeeping didn't restock the coffee, water, or the bathroom linens that had been placed on the floor.\n\nAt around 4:15 p.m. we thought we'd head down to the pool for a bit. I tried to contact guest services for the next twenty minutes via phone to find out where the pool towels were located. It would just ring and ring and no one would answer. I called again around 4:35 pm, someone picked up the phone and hung up on my promptly. I called back immediately and finally got an answer. We headed down to the pool at 4:45 pm. We were told no outside drinks and then discovered that the pool closed at 5:00 pm. Seriously?!\n\n\nSunday, April 8\n\nWe were jolted awake at 9:30 am by housekeeping. Are they not provided with rooms to clean in the morning that are not occupied?\n\nWe spent all of Sunday morning and early afternoon out with friends. We returned to the hotel to nap around 2:30 pm. I asked my boyfriend why my Frangelico was on his side of the bed and why nearly 5/6 of it was gone after I had only had three glasses. He informed me that he had noticed his Jameson was disappearing but though maybe he had drank more than he had thought. It became obvious that housekeeping or someone working at the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino was stealing and drinking our alcohol.\n\nThat evening we started to get ready and I couldn't find my red extension that was missing from Friday. I looked in everything as I was pre-packing for our departure the next morning. I never found it. Which means it was stolen or thrown away on purpose.\n\nMonday, April 9\n\nAs we finished packing and getting ready to head to the airport, we were once again interrupted by housekeeping. This time it was 9:15 am.\n\nAt the front desk we were asked if we enjoyed our stay. My boyfriend did the shoulder shrug and said not really. The guest services clerk so okay and continued to check us out."
3,"Awesome little brewpub I went by while in town for work. Was a little surprised (in a good way though) how busy it was for a Monday night, especially considering I didn't get there til nearly 9pm, but was glad it added to the \""festive\"" atmosphere.\n\nSome very good offerings on tap that they brew and the service from my bartender was very good (even if she did tell me the wrong order to drink my flight of beers). \n\nFood was pretty tasty as well and didn't take real long before being brought out."
1,"I visited Vegas, and visited the Carnival World Buffet, a half-dozen times over the past decade...I always remember it being better than it was this past visit (February 2013).  We bought discounted vouchers from the half-price ticket places that are all up and down the strip.  Dinner ended up being $22.99 including the voucher.  I probably wouldn't spend more than this if you're interested.  There is a HUGE selection here, but the quality isn't all that great.  Everything is cooked in such huge quantities that the quality suffers.\n\nI'm not a seafood person, but there did seem to be quite a large seafood section.\n\nIn all, I'll probably pass on this buffet next trip and visit the Mirage Buffet in its place."
2,Can a restaurant be any darker inside then this place?  Thought about turning my flashlight app on to help read the menu.  The food is decent and reasonably priced.  Service is friendly.   Need to try the happy hour which looks to be a good value.
0,"Worst food. They don't know how to make dal tadka, mutter paneer infact not even masala papad. They should realize idli is not whiskey, the older the better."
0,"I don't think I will ever eat at Pei Wei again, not because of the service (which was terrible- took 15 min to make a chicken fried rice dish) but because the veges that came with were basically RAW. I had RAW snow peas in COOKED chicken (DRY as hell too) with asian sauces and cooked carrots. That just made it taste horrific. The spicy chicken was overly dry, there were only like 5 pieces of it anyway. I was expecting it to be at least as good as some generic kung pao Americanized chicken drenched in artery clogging goodness but no this was just a dry + small portions of artery clogging disaster. It just tasted old too.\n\nNot to mention I paid about 10$ for this, I much rather have 2 items from the McD dollar menu, which also would have been served in the fraction of the time.\n\nIf you're ever deciding between Pei Wei and Panda Express, ALWAYS go Panda. Christ."
1,"Spent the midweek at a safety conference here. Last day a large amount of attendees contracted Norovirus and became violently ill. I will say, however, that before that incident, the room service was actually pretty good, both dinner and breakfast. The blinds in the room didn't completely block out the sunlight in the morning and you can't adjust them  horizontally because of their vertical design. We believe the Norovirus came from the food served at the conference."
4,"Amazing pizza from a amazing local family. Support local chains and the best pizza in the valley!! \n\nThe slices are amazing , get pesto the crust. Love their wings the Joe sauce is amazing. My recommendation would be a pepperoni, sausage and meatball slice with pesto on the crust... So amazing"
1,"Have again: the Philly sandwich was actually not bad because the bun was delicious and the meat/onions was good.\nNot have again: the bacon/cheese fries were marred because of the cheese, which of course is not really cheese. Service was not very good since I had to remind them that they still needed to give me the fries twice."
0,"I really, really, really wanted to like this place and hope they can work the kinks out and stay in business. However, it's a long shot if they keep their current manager. \n\nI've been here twice, once with my hubby on date night; looking for a romantic place to enjoy a glass of wine and some much needed convo. Manager sauntered over, had a seat in our cosy corner and proceeded to complain to us about his employees and how much more work that put on him! Well, you're the manger yo!\n\nNext visit, I brought my family. We did not know ahead of time, but they were having a free wine tasting hosted by this same manager.  He wrongly assumed that we were wine newbies and arrogantly shared his vision to bring wine education to our community through his hand selected wine list... Which of course, wasn't the same wine list he would choose for himself. When not serving wine behind his wine barrel tasting station, he sat playing on his phone. Yikes!\n\nI wish I could say the food made up for the poor experience, however the bruschetta (low cost, high profit item) we all shared, was flavorless. Hummus was the highlight. \n\nOverall look and feel of the place is clubby and warm. Unfortunately, cheap table chairs, while nice looking, are uncomfortable. \n\nEven though this place is needed and welcome in my neighborhood... They need to bump it up!"
2,"Not impressed. We got an Oreo, Banana Beanutbutter, pineapple express and Smores. The cupcakes were good, moist but the actual cake was a little flavorless. I expected to be blown away with a $3 cupcake. My wife makes cupcakes at home that are just as good."
1,"I love the BJ's chain but this restaurant is very hit and miss.  I have had some of the worst service in my life at this place.  Last winter a group of seven sat down for lunch and it took 30 minutes for the drinks and then another 20 minutes to order.  So 50 minutes before we ordered our food.  The pizza at this particular BJs is terrible, they put almost no sauce on the bread and over cook it."
3,"Italian boyfriend means one thing, Italian food! This restaurant definitely requires a reservation, as it is small and busy. The interior was very relaxing and set a positive tone for our meal.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in the door the customer service was amazing. With a family of waitresses and waiters constantly checking up on us. The food was a little expense but the portions were huge! I got the chicken parmigiana and I could have easily shared it with another person.\n\nOverall a great atmosphere and great food. I would recommend this restaurant to those that like Italian food, and are prepared for some great service."
1,"Looked at the rating and thought it would be exciting....but nothing at all special.  The huevos rancheros SUCKED.  Very bland, nothing great at all.  We also got some dish that was mushrooms, cheese and spinach on a bialy (but they were out so it was on a english muffin)  not bad.  But for like $10 I and tons of good reviews, I would expect more than just tortillas from a bag on the side of over easy eggs and like 2 pieces of avocado."
2,CMU food truck. \nRice is dry and old. Clumped together. \n\nChicken and vegetable  - has only vegetable \n\nShould have gone with General Tso
4,"This is hands down my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas!! It is usually pretty busy, especially on Fri and Sat nights but it is worth any wait time, without question.  The stuffed dates are excellent and the mac & cheese is heaven.  If you come to Las Vegas I HIGHLY Recommend you put The Firefly on your list of must visits!"
1,"I came here to eat great chocolate and was sorely disappointed. I had lunch a mediocre sandwich, my friend had chili that was called \""big chili\"" but was in a shallow bowl and was more soupy than chili like. I got the \""famous\"" frozen hot chocolate. If you want to reproduce the flavor get some Nestle Quick, add a spoon of sugar and freeze it.\n\nIf you like chocolate I suggest going to Max Brenner just a bit down the way. As another Yelper said this play is \""Over Priced and Over Hyped\"""
2,"Went here last night for the first time. Almost didn't bother to go in; the restaurant side only had one couple in it. Not a good sign for a good restaurant.  Bar had a dozen or so, though. \n\nCaesar salad was bad. Extremely salty! Lettuce was limp. Must have been made hours early. \n\nHad heirloom tomato pasta dish for entree. Pasta was a little on the heavy side. Maybe whole wheat? Overall, an ok dish. Not great, but not bad. \n\nA little too dark for my taste. Needed phone to read the menu. \n\nServe was very good. Checked in regularly and took care of everything (water refill, second glass of wine, etc. ) himself."
1,"I was seeing a show at the Dodge Theater, was short on time, and hungry! I wasn't sure what restaurants were around the Dodge, so my friend and I walked down Washington, confident that we'd stumble upon something at some point. And we did, it was Tom's Restaurant and Tavern. They seemed to have a pretty decent beer selection, and open tables, which we were happy to find so close to the show. \n\nWe sat down and took a look at the menu. It was a special event menu, which I really hate. I don't see the point of restricting the menu so much just because of a show down the street. There were about 4 vegetarian options, few of which seemed appetizing. My friend opted for the potato skins sans chili and I opted for the jalapeno hummus. The waiter returned some time later to let me know that they were out of the hummus, and gave me a different menu that had the aldo pasta listed. penne pasta, marinara sauce, parmesan cheese and garlic bread- i was sold. The food arrived, and wasn't bad. The pasta was pretty small, but was enough to fill me up, and my friend seemed ok with her potato skins. \n\nOverall, the food was ok, but it was really the service that caused me to rate them with only two stars. I'm not sure if our server is a server by trade- it seemed like it might have been his first night. He was super slow and had a really hard time remembering what we had ordered. He also seemed to have to have a hard time with keeping our orders straight and not confusing them with the orders of the tables next to us. I was also really disappointed by the menu. I know that this is more of an old-fashioned diner, but the options were so limited that it was actual work finding something to eat (I'm sorry, but when I was hoping for some cheese or some spicy flavor, a plate of steamed veggies just doesn't sound appetizing). \n\nI'd be willing to give this place another shot, but definitely not on an \""event\"" night, because it was really pretty lame."
2,"Came here last week for dinner.  Overall the experience was just \""ok\"".  We arrived and had to wait about 5-10mins, which was no big deal since there were a few people in front of us and the restaurant looked busy.  When it was our turn to be seated we went around the partition and half the tables were empty, so I'm not sure what the wait was for. Our waiter was prompt and our drink/food order taken in no time.  ( Quick Side note: We were seated toward the back and across from us a table filled with folded dish towels and aprons were sitting out...not sure why it was on a table for customers to see.  I will give them credit and the items were moved half way through our meal.) The food however took a while to come out.  I know this isn't a fast-food place but it took about 25-30 mins  for our 2 burgers and fries to hit the table. (No we didn't do appetizers).  The food was good, but I don't really see what the hype is all about.  Will we eat here again? Maybe, but this won't be on my top 5."
0,"Incredibly rude people work here. I walked in just to check out their sale. Way expensive for what you get. This isn't Prada so why are their suits $450? Hhhhmmm\n\nThey pretty much treated me like I didn't belong there. I guess being heavily tattooed means I must be poor. My bad, I'll just spend my hard earned wad of cash at other stores. The lady kept following me everywhere as if I was going to steal. Nice! Keep in mind, you work retail so customer service is important. Guess they didn't teach them that here."
4,This place is a hip breakfast spot with great food.  My family regularly goes here for the outstanding food; however the service needs a kick in the ass.  A waitress named Briana is prob the best waitress I ever had in ANY breakfast spot in my 14yrs since moving to Scottsdale. However if you get another waitress good luck.
0,A friend and I went on a groupon. We were excited to try the DIPPING bar. The tables that we were seated at were more like lounge seats. I didn't see where the dipping came into play because there wasn't any. The price was a little high and the buns on the burger fell apart fast. \n\nI wouldnt go back unless they brought in small snacks and DIP-ABLE food. I dont expect this place to last too long.
0,"once again the new manager/bartender,Ashley has destroyed another night of great sports with her terrible attitude and cluelessness to put on the proper game on main tv \nMonday night was game 5 of world series,and she chose to put the Monday night football game on main screen with sound.get a clue.their is a reason no one comes in or sits at bar when she is there."
1,"So the wife and I passed by this bar and debated whether or not to go.  This was really my first vacation in Vegas, and my whole goal for the trip was \""Don't get got\"".    For those who ain't hip to what that means, in a nutshell it means \""Don't get taken advantage of\"".  Like for instance when we ate at the Cathouse and came to find out we were charged $6 each for water, that broke my \""Don't get got\"" rule...LOL.      \n \nSo the fee was $25 each to get in, which included a coat, hat, gloves, and one drink.  So we're $50 in....and I'm already starting to regret the decision as I'm putting on the coat.  Then we're told that we aren't allowed to take pictures inside, but they do have a photographer that can take photos of us for a fee.    Crap.  They got my ass.\n\nWent inside and there were only four other people in there.  There's about 8 different drinks you can choose from.  I will say that the drinks weren't weak so that's a plus.   The wife wanted a photo so we ponied up the $12 for a photograph.  I sat there trying to slowly sip my drink to make it last...when it finally hit me.  This is the best gimmick in the world.  You pay the money to get in, you aren't going to stay in there but so long because it's cold, and then you leave so they can herd the next suckers in.\n\nI'm kind of torn about our time there.  On the one hand, its a unique experience that you won't get to have anywhere else.  On the other hand, I feel like it wasn't really worth the money.   But like my wife said, we experienced it and now we know what its like, so we don't ever have to go back again."
2,"3 Stars\n\nThe following review is NOT based on the locale, or how the restaurant is situated, seating arrangement or the conditions of the restrooms.\nThis review is a reflection of our latest EXPERIENCE ONLY.  \n...\n\nThe wifey & I met my niece here for an early dinner.\nWe were greeted heartily by the host who had his Cheshire grin on...a bit creepy, yes, but seemed genuine to make our stay pleasant. I told him that we were meeting a 3rd member of our party and that she was sitting at the bar. He showed us to the bar, had the bartender take our order while he had a staff member prepare our teppanyaki area.\nOnce seated around our grill, our drink order was taken almost immediately & served up quite quickly.\nShortly thereafter, our waiter was asking for our food order & all of a sudden I felt rushed.\nTwice, we had to tell the guy who was taking our order, that we'll need a few moments...\nMy niece only wanted a couple of rolls, \""The Hawaiian\"" & the \""Sexy Back\"" & a couple orders of sushi. Our order taker tried to push the \""Ex Girlfriend\"" & the \""What The Heck\"" rolls, but my niece knew exactly what she wanted & those suggested rolls weren't it.\nThe wife ordered the Chicken & I asked for the NY Steak (medium).\nOur Teppanyaki Chef came out & introduced himself as King.\nHe was damn good as most teppanyaki chefs are...all with the same flare tricks; the drumming of the grill with fork & spatula, flipping the salt shaker into hat, the juggling of the rice bowls...you get the picture. We've seen it all before, but always feel the need to \""ooh & ahhh\"" & of course, clap.\n[Does anyone feel a bit bewildered that Asian grill chefs are getting harder & harder find nowadays?]\nSeeing that my niece was only having sushi, King asked if we'd like to just go ahead and split the 2 dinners 3-ways...I said \""SURE! That'd be great!\"" All was shared including the rolls & sushi...\nWe hadn't seen our niece in quite some time so there was a lot of catching up to do, all the while the busboys were trying to grab our unfinished plates & platters... \""uhmmm, I'm still working on this...\"" ,  \""there's still some rolls on that\"". I felt annoyed once again. Sorry I wasn't eating fast enough for you, guy!\nKing cleaned the grilled & excused himself & we thanked him for a job well done.\nFinally, the food was cleared off our plates & taken away by the anxious bussing staff.\nAll the food was delicious & the steak cooked to perfection. It was the PERFECT amount of food for the 3 of us to have split like that...\nI asked for the check & our host asked how our experience was & we all agreed that it was good. He tried pushing the dessert but we had to kindly reject as we'd made previous plans to hit up the local smoothie joint.\nThe check was left & did a double-take on the total. Suddenly I'm interested at why it seemed high for just the 3 of us. Spying the itemized bill, THEY actually charge for SHARING! Uhmmm, my niece ordered a couple rolls & sushi totaling the cost of my steak dinner! WTF is up with this \""sharing\"" charge?\nI didn't bother bringing it up to the wifey cuz she probably would've made me make a scene or caused one herself...I paid the check with a smile vowing to warn my fellow YELPers.\nAfter telling this part of the experience to a friend & fellow YELPer, he said that they ALSO secretly charge for SPLIT checks! WTH?\nSo, be forewarned, check the check for secret charges. Ask to NOT have the dinner \""sharing\"" charge added if that person is ALREADY having what is equal to the total of a regular teppanyaki grill dinner.\n\nDeductions:\n1/2 STAR - for the hurried act of wanting/needing to take our order quickly.\n1/2 STAR - for trying to pull our unfinished plates while still chewing.\n1/2 STAR - for the \""secret\"" charges.\n\nMay your palate always be surprised by goodness & your glass never be empty!\n\nAnother deez\u00ae review, because you deserve it."
1,"Rising sun burger-teriyaki too sweet \nSweet potato fries decent, but same ol' same ol'.\nEl machete-no heat, no flavor except pepper jack cheese. Meat by itself wasn't that tasty.\nBuffalo chicken dip was more cheesy than buffalo-y. Had better and have made better.\nOnion rings-whatever\n\nToo many good burger joints in Vegas to come back here."
3,Got this place from Diners Drivins and Dives. When I walked in to this place it looked kind of low budget but when we tasted the food it was suprisingly wonderful. The only problem was service. They forgot my wifes meal and that took a while to fix. But the food is worth going back and trying again.
4,Fantastic food. Try the sparkling blueberry sake. It's worth $16 for a bottle. I highly recommend coming here and getting the steak and chicken combo. And definitely get the fried rice. I come here often and will continue to.
4,"I've been to the Brillobox on two occasions, both under very different circumstances and at opposite times of the day.\n\nThe first occasion:\nI was here on a weekend night, attending a show my boyfriend's band was performing in. Being, the stereotypical \""groupie girlfriend\"", I was exiled to mingle among the peons (err, \""crowd\"", that is) while my boyfriend and his bandmates set up the stage with the other bands.\n\nThe space upstairs where the show was held is wonderful. The decor is enough to keep one's eye consistently entertained, the beer selection is on point, and the sound fills up the entire room without being overbearingly loud. In addition, it was fairly empty for a weekend night, thus making it easier to order libations, talk without screaming, and not have to fight through a sea of sweaty bros. The staff also seems very laissez-faire when it comes to operating the venue, a welcome change from the uptight and anal doormen I know oh-so-well from DC and New York bars.\n\nThe second occasion:\nIn a sheer act of desperation, my boyfriend and I (sorry to be that Yelper that always writes \""my boyfriend and I\"") came here on a late Sunday afternoon for brunch. Since I had been here for a show, I certainly wasn't expecting their brunch to be anything decent, as I know from experience that venues tend not to have the greatest food.\n\nOh, how wrong I was. And wonderfully so!\n\nI ordered the Farmhouse French Toast, quite possibly one of the best french toasts I've ever had. (Coming from a self-proclaimed french toast connoisseur, that says a lot.) The venue was completely empty, save for a small group of diners who may or may not have worked there. Unlike most french toasts, the bread was not an eggy, fluffy challah bread, but rather a thick slab of country seed loaf. Also unlike any french toast I've ever had, it was smothered in warm, dripping peanut butter and agave nectar, topped with a thin layer of apple compote. First off, peanut butter and apples go together like Thelma and Louise. Second off, WARM PEANUT BUTTER ON FRENCH TOAST?! Simple as it may be, whoever came up with this is brilliant. The slices were toasted - thus crisp and crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The agave nectar was the perfect sweetener to this dish without being disgustingly sweet (as many maple syrups tend to be).\n\nTo top off our last-minute brunch savior, the service was excellent. There was an amazing stop-motion claymation video playing on the projector, which I kindly asked the waitstaff about. They didn't seem to know who it was, but returned moments later with the DVD and information about the director. That's some pretty badass service.\n\nWhile many complain about the obnoxious American Apparel hipsters that frequent Brillo, I didn't have any issues with the clientele. So long as they stay within their plastered-on skinny jeans and keep to their unhygienic selves, I really don't care."
2,"Good but not great.  Liked Montigu better than cannonball. Boyfriend finished the larger pieces from both sandwiches we tried, and he was still hungry.  Taste-wise, if we were in Miracle Mile Mall, we might eat there again... But won't make a separate trip."
2,"I really loved the atmosphere at The Grind - they did a nice job designing the small space, with the exception of the TVs behind the glass covering that catches the glare from the sun outside. We sat at the bar to eat and received friendly service from the bartender, although not the most prompt...it seemed like the whole staff was a bit frenzied and in over their heads, even the manager. I like that they have Anchor Steam and Stella on tap, but I wouldn't pay $3 for the PBR. What I don't like is the lack of milkshake options...gourmet burger places should have gourmet sides and gourmet shakes, not just the standard chocolate/vanilla/strawberry I can get at McDonald's for half the price.\n\nTwo of us ordered the peppercorn burger, sweet potato fritters, and coal roasted veggies to share. A couple minutes later, the bartender told us they were out of the fritters. That's a major strike - when you have this few items on the menu (just 4 side dishes), how can you be out of something like that?! With disappointment, we ordered the scalloped potatoes instead. I would give the sides here 4 stars but the burger just 3 stars. The beef itself in the burger wasn't that flavorful and was a little overcooked. The scalloped potatoes were very rich and delicious, and the green beens were really flavorful. I'd stop in here for a drink, if I was in the neighborhood, but for burgers, I'd go to Delux instead."
4,"I love to hike Sunrise Trail, but my favorite is the backside of the mountain (to get there, you just drive all the way east on Via Linda until the road ends at the gated community). There's enough people out hiking that you don't feel completely alone out there, but I've never had trouble getting a spot in their little parking lot. (A nice departure from the craziness of Camelback and Piestewa Peak). The backside of the mountain is a shorter, but steeper hike than the other trail. There are gorgeous views of Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Fountain Hills (you can see the Fountain Hills fountain going off in the distance). This time of year is especially beautiful when the wildflowers are in bloom."
0,"Everyones revoews sound great for this place so I went to check it out. The food needs so much flavor. There was no salt, no salsa and worst of all I ordered tacos al pastor (spicy pork meat) and they told me it would be 20 min for them when 3 others ordered it after me and got them right on the spot. I would not return here at all... once I got home I opened the tacos, they fell apart, all I did was take it out of the foil... worst service ever."
0,"Reserved room a week in advance and requested 11am early check in, is now 3:45pm and we've been waiting at the resort all day. Classic bad business: under delivering after over promising. The Grand just a few miles away seems like a much better option."
3,"Alright, another chain restaurant. Chipotle is Chipotle no matter where you go. They win on consistency.\n\nWhat makes this one in particular stand out is the only thing that's different here: The people. Fast and friendly very aptly describes them. As far as speed, when business is slow, I'm pretty sure I've managed to be in and out of this place in less than a minute. It was kinda crazy. That was even including smiles and a couple jokes. Seriously, who can manage that?\n\nI'm definitely glad this is right by my work. It makes for a great quick lunch grab!"
4,"Most of the things we had here were excellent.\n\nCrispy Squid - Basically dressed up fried calamari; but very well done.  Fresh, crispy tasting, and served with two really awesome sauces splayed beautifully across the plate.  Big winner appetizer here.\n\nRough Cut Tuna \""Nachos\"" - Can probably pass on this one.  Chunks of moderately bland/unseasoned raw tuna are served with about 20 absurdly tiny \""nacho\"" dipping tortilla chips (think mini tostitos bite size rounds, with half of them blue corn and half regular)\n\nSixteen Spice Crusted Chicken - This was pretty delicious.  Tender, juicy, spices crisped on the skin... it was a very nice piece of poultry.  The buttermilk mashed potatoes were also killer.\n\nMango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak - Yes its true they like mango and spices here.  This was by far the most delicious thing on the table.  The tuna was just overflowing with an awesome spice crusted exterior.  It was perfectly seared.  As you bite into it, you get that fantastic full tuna taste and texture at first.  Then the spices kick in a little more slowly, intensifying in flavor throughout the bite, with a real nice spicy punch in there at some point as well.  Wow this was an awesome piece of tuna.\n\nSomehow we got out of here for under $100 a person despite ordering entrees, appetizers, cocktails and wine.  Good times!"
3,"Burger #190: In Good Company\n\nThank god I was surrounded by health care professionals when I ate that burger. With a 99% chance of a heart attack, they would have had only a few minutes to prep me for an organ donation after my cardiac death. Lucky for me, that burger didn't kill me and I was able to conquer it. \n\nWhen out with clients, I typically try not to do anything too \""Eli\"" like. But when the menu said \""Bacon Cheese Burger on Steroids\"" and promised six strips of bacon with bacon salt and baconnaise, I couldn't help myself. Since I was already going to hell for ordering that meaty death on a plate, I upped the ante by adding a fried egg to the gluttonous pile. \n\nBehold;\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yWUBX9Pe6pzh1PjVj04UmQ?select=g17yyWNzeNH8tx3llO2xZQ\n\nIt was everything I had hoped for; meaty, rich, baconny, juicy, packed with flavor, and overly sinful. The six strips of bacon all melded together into a rich decadent topping that was only enhanced by the runny egg yolk. The mild jack cheese did its part by adding a smooth texture and another fatty element to the mix. The bun was perfect; unobtrusive and sturdy enough to withstand the burger's might. The only thing keeping the burger from perfection was that it came a tad overcooked, other than that it was great. \n\nThe coup de gras (pun intended) were the tater tots. They were some of the best I've ever had. Crisp, salty, and delicious. They were just what I needed to help wash down the insanity that was my burger."
3,They do a good job and I always get coupons when I come in.  I will continue to go here in the future.  :)
4,"I love this Asda. And its even better with added the petrol station :)\n\nLocation wise its perfect, can be pretty busy, but not horrendously so and the queues aren't that bad. \n\nIt has a good range of products, including lots of deals on branded products and the availability is pretty good as there is nothing worse than trekking to the supermarket and finding empty shelves.\n\nThe gluten free range isn't great - the best range in the Slateford/Gorgie area is Sainsbury, but there is a good range of basics and some great frozen options.\n\nSupermarkets are fairly generic but as this one goes, its pretty darn good..."
0,"If this is what you can expect from award winning Chinese food in Las Vegas, you are in trouble.  The place seemed very popular.  They opens at 11 and there were already a score of people waiting outside at 10:45 on a Wednesday.  They also had a full house for lunch service.  With these said, the service and food are horribly disappointing.   Our combination BBq only filled half a plate and was $14.  The beef was cut into too large size and hard to chew.  I ordered some fried rice for kids and it was very blend without taste.  This is also a cash only place, which makes me wonder what they are doing with the tax they are collecting.  In summary, rude waiters, horrible food, expensive menu.  Needless to say, we won't return and will be looking for greener pastures."
4,"Love this family owned shop. I brought 7 watches in for battery replacement and 2 watches in for repair. I was charged less than half of what it would've been at a generic mall kiosk. The value is second to none and the service is personable, friendly and honest."
2,"Okay I usually don't like say anything negative about anyone or business but here is my peace, I ordered a deep dish pizza and two eight piece wings. Given the wings are only $6, however they are like micro wings, almost like they use adolescent chickens instead of full grown chickens...Maybe they do, I dunno. I would like to point out that at no point in this review did I complain or bash the deep dish pizza. Ugh gotta have the yin with the yang I guess!!"
4,I had lavendar and Rose petal. Outstanding & great flavors. Worth finding. There is parking in the front.
3,"Considering what an average meal costs on the Strip, a burger, shake and fries combo for $19 is not so bad.  I don't think this meal would cost much less at the crappy casino coffee shop, anyway.  Go for a shake if nothing else."
4,"Fuji has become one of our regular go-to places when we're craving Japanese (which is often).  I do try to get something different each time, but I am a big fan of the spider roll, and theirs is especially delicious--I can't resist.  It's great for lunch or dinner, and the hibachi show is a lot of fun--and delicious!  \n\nService is always friendly, attentive and quick.  I will go back again and again."
2,I was waiting for the car to the airport and stopped in for a drink and a snack.  Sat at the bar and got a glass of sauvignon blanc and ordered the truffle potato chips.  Truffle anything is good right?  I wish I had known that the chips were going to come drowned in a dip that was well on it's way to gelatenous.   I would have ordered the dip on the side because I hate soggy chips.  The chips were amazing though.  The bartender was great and the perfect balance of chatty but not too much.
0,"The emperor has no clothes.  There.  I said it.  I had one the top 5 WORST dining experiences of my life eating at Durant's.  The food was average.  I had scallops that were slightly overcooked, poorly seasoned and somewhat gritty.  I tasted my fellow dining mates steaks and they were well below average compared to other steaks in this cost bracket (Flemings, Ruths Chris, Capital Grill).  And at $30 an entree I expect my food to be served without a side of attitude.  The service wasn't bad, it was offensive.  Our server was rude, sarcastic, flippant, and completely disrespectful. My husband actually got up halfway through the dinner to pull him aside and alert him that we were not happy with the service and to give him a chance to step it up.  We were quite polite and discrete about it.  The server proceeded to come back to the table and make jokes about this and announced sarcastically to the table that \""he heard we were in a rush to get somewhere\"" and he was going to speed things up.  Um.  Wrong.  We weren't in a rush.  All we wanted was to enjoy our dinner.  It was bad enough I brought my parents to this place.  But I would have been truly mortified if I had brought a client here.  I will never go back.  \n\nIf you have read my reviews, you know I am not prone to writing harsh reviews unless it is totally deserved. This one is.  Durants seems to be one of those old school restaurants that is skating by on its history and once-deserved reputation.  My advice?  Don't bother.  I can think of at least 5 other steak houses in the Valley where you will get a better meal for about the same or less money with far better service.\n\nLets review:  expensive mediocre food, horrible service, loud chaotic atmosphere...  really?  Your still going to give it a try?  Okay, don't say I didn't warn you."
0,"Sorry guys, you were nice to talk to but the haircut wasn't what I asked for. Not only that, my fringe is so wonky Stevie Wonder could have done a better job."
2,"I am not one to turn down Hooters and actually enjoy the classiness of their fine establishments. All kidding aside, I really do love Hooters. For their wings. \n\nThe only thing I like about this particular one is that it's in the middle of Mill and it's upstairs... I don't know why, but I just like that it's a Hooter's that overlooks the street.\n\nThe waitresses here seem to be slow in general, as far as taking orders, getting your drinks, etc. I'm not sure why but the few times I've been here I've received the same slow service. Though, once those delicious wings are served to me I have not a care in the world! Unless it's taking too long to get my beer... then we have a problem."
4,"It seems I always end up running errands on Saturday and after a long day of getting in and out of the car, loading and unloading groceries, washing the car, getting gas and all the things working professionals have to squeeze in on their day of... Echo and Rig is right there about the time my feet hurt and my stomach growls!\n\nI went again this Saturday and had the usual, exception service.  There are a few new items on the small plates (which is pretty much my \""go to\"" and any restaurant)  Last time when i didn't write a review I tried the steak  tare tartare.  This didn't have the traditional egg on top and was actually a really well balanced dish and treated more like ceviche with pickes as the acid source and noticable, large pieces of cracked black pepper (took me by suprise with the first \""crunch\"")\n\nThe second new item I tried on this last visit was the Sweetbread!  OMG!  I will be ordering them again when I go back with friends on Friday.\n\nMy only question now is can I get a table for 8 for 4 diners? LOL!  I love the small plates so much I know I'm going to end up with at least 12 plates plus wine/drinks on my next excursion.  :-D"
0,"Very Disappointed \n\nWhen I take my vehicle to the carwash I go with the understanding that I am going to get a \""sales pitch\"" for either an upgraded wash or a push to have my vehicle detailed.  On this occasion the sales pitch was for a vehicle detail.  I explained to the attendant that I did not want a detail at this time.  The sales associate spent several minutes explaining why I needed a detail, after I repeatedly stated I wasn't interested.  I understand the \""sale pitch\"" what I don't appreciate is going beyond the \""sales pitch\"" and becoming intrusive. I did however upgrade the carwash.\n\nI have to admit I expected better service. The windows and side mirrors were not cleaned very well. The center console was not wiped down, nor were the rims, or the dashboard. I had to ask the attendant to clean those areas.  Overall my experience was less then favorable,  I won't be going back."
0,"I went here twice this weekend for my first and second time. I went a second time because the first time we came closer to close and they didn't have much of a selection so we decided to give it another go...After reading a review from someone else saying that they had over charged her and her friends I decided to take a picture of my receipt. I shouldn't have even tipped at all because the service was terrible. The  we had to deal with three different waitress' because the one we were assigned to never came to our table and \""forgot\"" to put my friends order in for Teryaki chicken.\n\nWe signed out check for $25.00...I checked my statement and they charged me $28.01. (I have posted a picture of my bill and bank statement). When I called to speak to a manager the woman acted like it was nothing. When I told her about the other review and that that was why I took the picture she said, \""yeah i don't know why this is happening so much. Maybe the can't read the machine.\"" REALLY your servers are stealing from your customers and that is okay because they \""can't read the machine\""?!?! We are never going back there. \n\nI would rather pay MORE money to an honest business than go back there and be stolen from and have terrible service."
3,"Would give 5 but I think the story was slow in some parts and I was tired from a long day of exploring the strip, so I caught myself wanting to nod off. The man sitting behind me actually did!  I think the best part of the show was about the last 40 minutes or so when the action and acrobatics really pick up.  The stage is like a character in and of itself and is amazing.  \n\nWe did choose to see Ka because our first choices were unavailable during the time frame we'd be in town. I'm glad I did see it because I'm a huge Cirque fan. Much better than La Reve."
2,"This location is not the best in the LV valley, but the burgers are juicy and made to order. My only complaint is that it is bit over price. Not sure I would ever order the XXXL burger. It might be too much burger if that is even possible."
1,"This place has issues with mold.  The end.  That's all there is to it.  \n\nMy husband and I are long time fans of Sprouts and were excited when this location was revamped since we've always had to drive several miles to the Dobson and Ray location.  I've had issues with my Sunflower produce going bad within a day or two of purchasing it and quit shopping there a couple years ago... I guess I was over-optimistic returning to this specific location.\n\nI wasn't going to write a review about our visit last Friday until just now when I looked over my bank statement and realized we spent $113 on food we could only eat half of.  Even the chicken went bad.  At the store, my husband looked through 20+ cartons of blueberries and could not find one without visible mold.  The eggs and yogurt all expired the day we were shopping so we went without this last week.  Obviously not a huge deal but c'mon... I go to the grocery store for food I can purchase and eat.\n\nIn addition to the mold, the meat and bread selections were lacking and I have no idea why they don't have more Sprouts-brand options considering that it is now a Sprouts.\n\nI hate writing ugly reviews because I feel like a lot of folks are nit-pickers... but seriously, y'all.  I'm talking about MOLD.  Lots and lots of mold.\n\nThe employees are super nice and the lines are short.  Customer service is not an issue unless you consider not removing spoiled produce a customer service issue....\n\nI do hope that Sprouts can resolve this problem but I gotta admit, I will not return to find out.  Thank goodness for the new location on 48th and Ray."
3,"Bar none, Double Wide Grill is the best place to spend a summer night in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is housed in a converted gas station, and its former parking lot is now covered with picnic tables. Globe lights twinkle overhead and a corn hole pit beckons patrons from the corner of the outdoor seating area. There's no bad seat on the patio, with gorgeous public art murals bookending the restaurant and a parade of Carson Street humanity constantly marching by. \n\nBecause it is housed in a converted gas station, Double Wide has adopted a white trash theme. (Hence the 'Double Wide' moniker.) Customers can order a six-pack of beer delivered to their table in a cooler, or a custom-made TV dinner on a tray. As a recent Tennessee transplant I am constantly on the lookout for good barbecue, and Double Wide has that as well. Although not up to Knoxville standards, my pulled pork platter was juicy and tender, and the cornbread was incredibly sweet and delicious. I do, however, take issue with the restaurant's coleslaw, which isn't the creamy, homestyle mixture that I adore, but a bizarre tangy concoction full of cherries. Cherries? Seriously? If Double Wide truly wants to make a name as an arbiter of great southern fare, they will have to remedy the coleslaw situation.\n\nThat having been said, pretty much everything I've ordered at the restaurant has been excellent. This includes crab, black bean and corn fritters, a portabella mushroom stuffed with spinach and brie, the barbecue chicken ranch salad, and several types of tacos. Surprisingly a full page of the menu is devoted to vegetarian and vegan options, so something is truly available to satisfy every member of your group. And that includes canines! Not only is Double Wide's patio dog friendly, but they boast an entire menu devoted to the beasts. My pup, Radar, loves coming to Double Wide, where he plays in the mulch around the shrubbery, receives tons of love and attention, and gets to eat a piece of grilled chicken or beef made just for him! \n\nSitting outside on a warm summer night, drinking with your friends and watching the city move past is one of the best feelings in the world, and in Pittsburgh, Double Wide Grill is the place to do it."
4,Had dinner here recently with my wife and 4 month old. The staff was very accommodating of our giant stroller and extremely friendly. We split the No. 7 and 8 for dinner and it was excellent -- great to get locally produced/inspired foods. The beer list is long and Wisconsin focused. All around a great experience!
3,"Good quality food and great help for the business guy on the go.  Phone order for 2 dozen bagels, in and out, no stress.  They always come through."
0,"I live around the corner and figured I'd give the place a try.  Since it is a cafe I assumed they would have a variety of tasty sandwiches to choose from.  Boy was I wrong.  They literally have 4 sandwiches to chose from and they are nearly identical.  3 pieces of bread, mayo, and egg are on everything.   They apparently think their clientele is made up of grade school children because they cut the crust off of the bread. \n\n The sandwiches are pre-made, they just pulled it out of the fridge and gave me half.  Good luck saying \""no mayo\"".  Who sells a sandwich by the half?  It had 3 pieces of bread, a smearing of mayo with pimiento on one side, and a razor thin piece of cheese or ham in the other.  When I saw how lame the sandwich was I asked for an Empenada too but they told me 10 minutes to heat it up.  I wasn't waiting for that, I was hungry.  The sandwich was average and even though he gave me a card to get a free sandwich, I will not be going back.\n\nThey sell smoothies if you are into that.  But, they have the name \""cafe\"" in the title so that is how they will be judged.  Poor excuse for a sandwich, plus no variety, plus no substance, plus no selection equals a disaster of a place.  \n\nDrink options are bottled soda or bottled water.  After eating the 3 bite sandwich (it literally could have been smashed into 1 bite) in the car before pulling out of the parking lot I immediately wondered where I was going to get lunch.  That is a bad sign.  \n\nThere are way to many good places with variety, value, and freshness in the area to waste your time trying this place out."
1,"I came here with a group of friends for my birthday dinner. We had the 13 course tasting menu. \n\nSome initial downsides were: very crowded and has an \""energetic\"" environment. It's difficult to get them to agree to a large dinner, and when they do, you have to do a tasting course. When you do the tasting course you have to sign a contract. If you sign the contract you guarantee the # of folks in your party.\n\nIn our case, half the table decided they didn't want to eat and so they walked out. This left me arguing with the F&B manager for the night, who produced a copy of the contract - that was oddly missing the page where I wrote that the size of the party could change (and signed off on by the F&B manager for the restaurant)\n\nI seriously argued with this person for over 20 minutes going back and forth as to the best course of action, while all my guests sat waiting. On my birthday dinner. \n\nEventually we reached a draw and decided to just eat. So the food started coming and it was actually AMAZING! It has been a minute so I forget ALL the courses but here are the ones I remember:\n\n- the bruschetta w/ tomato - amazing. I still think about it. \n- dates w/ bacon \n- the paella of course\n\nUnfortunately there were more issues...after the first 4-5 courses came out, we sat for 30 minutes without a single additional course coming. This was actually a good thing (wait and see). After pointing out to the waiter that no food was coming to our table, he went back to the kitchen and did something because orders started coming out, but not in the order on the menu. My guess would be that the kitchen fell behind on our table, got yelled at, and fired whatever they could get immediately. So props to them for getting things moving.\n\nDessert was delicious. The wine list was amazing. \n\nAnd, our F&B minimum was eventually adjusted due to the failure at the table. \n\nFollowing are my recommendations for this spot:\n\n- it's too high volume for a large group. Come in smaller groups (less than 10) and order off the menu instead of getting a tasting menu.\n\n- don't sign a contract because if things don't go your way, they'll be inflexible and refuse to work with you, even a little bit.\n\n- if you do sign a contract then get the private room at least. \n\nI'm giving this spot 5 stars for the food and taking 3 stars away for the awful customer service."
3,"After being quickly seated and served our $1.25 margaritas, I ordered the Navajo Tostada Grande, made of freshly made frybread, beans, green chile, beef, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  It was a lot of food for the $8.95. It tasted good, the beef was tender. I would give it just 3 stars, but the service was so good, I gave them an extra star.  The staff makes you feel at home. We sat at our table and talked to friends for an extra hour after our plates were cleared and they kept our water glasses full the whole time."
3,"Finally, good Vietnamese food in the Southwest valley! I had eaten at the former location a few times but have gone just as many times since they moved closer to where I live.\n\nI think they are related to or affiliated with a popular restaurant in Orange County called Anh Hong which is known for it's Bo 7 Mon (7 courses of beef). Few restaurants serve this specialty dish ( meal, really) so we're lucky to have Bamboo Bistro. If you haven't tried it, bring a few friends (no vegetarians) and enjoy!\n\nOther dishes they do well are the fried, whole catfish (often ordered with Bo 7 Mon), the mushroom soup and the pan fried noodles (in the appetizer section of the menu - Hieu Tieu Ap Chao)."
1,"This was featured on some travel show because of their super tall wine tower and \""wine angels.\""  It's pretty cool watching the two women suspended by wires going up and down to fetch wine.  Their wine list is also computerized - they give you something that looks like an iPad rather than a paper menu.  The ambiance is nice and the food is good but nothing wowed me. However, our server Ronaldo, left much to be desired as we found him to be brusque and somewhat rude.\n\nWe came in using a gift certificate from Restaurant.com, so maybe that's why we got shabby treatment.  Obviously the restaurant is in need of new customers, which is they they had the certificate offered on Restaurant.com to begin with.  My friend ordered a glass of wine (Chardonnay - $12) and I drank tap.  After we ordered our entrees, the waiter asked, \""And for your first course?\""  A more diplomatic way he could have asked if we were ordering appetizers could have been, \""Will you be ordering anything else?\""  I found it to be pretty rude and pushy to assume we would be ordering appetizers.  Sorry, but since when is it expected that you order a certain amount when dining out?  I would have tipped him much less than I did, except that we were waited on by various ppl, so I assumed they shared the tip and I did not want to stiff some of the others who were quite nice (the bread man, the man who refilled our glasses).  We were also largely ignored after our entrees came.  No one asked how our dinner was and we had to wait at least 10 minutes after our dishes were cleared to get dessert menus hastily thrown at us.  As a result, we did not order any dessert due to the treatment we got.   I noticed the table next to us did not get serviced very well either, even though the guy ordered a $200 bottle of wine.  However, I did notice that someone asked them if they would like to have their picture taken, and they declined.  No one asked us if we'd like our picture taken!!  \n\nAs far as the food goes, the seafood is fresh but I doubt it's sustainable.  The scallops were succulent and large; my black cod was tender.  The corn succotash was good but not $8 worth.  I think it had like two beans in it - they call that succotash??  I loved the bread!  I got the pretzel bread (my favorite) and some bacon tasting bread, which was also good.  \n\nI won't be back, with or without a coupon.  Aureole should really hire nicer waiters or at least train the ones they have better."
1,"As a huge fan of Greek food, I am always looking for something authentic, something skin to the Mediterranean Snack Bar where I grew up, burning my little fingers on the hot dish which held my often craved spinach casserole. I sat on tall chairs with my mother, my legs dangling as I looked around at the small restaurant. The meat on a spit, the bright blues and whites of the decor.\nThe Tempe location of MBFGR gets one more star than the Chandler location, but then my review of the Chandler location was damn near scathing, so that's not saying much.\nTo make an honest comparison, I ordered the same thing: the chicken souvlaki pita. This time I went with the side salad, which was full of bright colors and fresh looking. The food arrived in good time and the chicken was tasty, if lukewarm. The service was friendly, even if our waitress forgot to bring pitas.\nMBFGR just does not come close to my childhood memories, but then that was New York.\nI agree with Melissa H. that everyone can find something that they like. The food is so Americanized. At least they could serve it hot.\nIf anyone has any authentic Greek suggestions...?"
4,"My husband and I finally decided to make it in here.  We have driven by and read reviews but somehow haven't made it inside for the year that they have been open.  I had been wanting Pad Thai and that was enough to get us in the door! \n\nAlong with the Pad Thai my husband ordered the eggplant.  I had a glass of pinot noir which was great.\n\nWe spent some time talking to David the owner.  He was very friendly and we talked about food and other restaurants.  \n\nOur food was excellent.  I read some other reviews that commented on smaller portions with higher prices.  I have to admit that I did think that briefly.  But as soon as I tasted my dish I knew that it was amazing.  The eggplant was excellent.   I actually said out loud, \""this is worth it!\""  It really was.  I looked over at my husband's plate which was nearly empty but I managed to get the last of the sauce to pour over the last bite of rice.  We devoured every bit and were totally satisfied.  The portions were actually the perfect size. \n\nAfter we paid the check we picked up the menu again.  David saw us looking and we assured him that we were picking out our meal for the next visit!  Can't wait to return."
4,"The best cake, cupcakes and cookies in town. Will use for all future events. Thank you Barbs!"
1,"Before the Peoria location opened, I'd never had a Fatburger, I think I saw the chain in other cities but had never eaten at one.  I ate at this one not long after it first opened, and I REALLY liked it.  It was one of the better fast burgers that I've had.  The fries were good, the place was clean, and I loved the number placard that they gave you to claim your meal with its music and burger trivia on it.\n\nThe placards went away, and apparently so did the initial quality and cleanliness.\n\nI still like Fatburger burgers, but I don't know if I'll be returning to this location.  I no longer live in Phoenix, so I pretty much only get to Fatburger when I come to town, and always thought of this as a good place.  Well, sadly, it isn't that good of a place any more.  The burgers, in my opinion, still taste good.  But the place has suffered from neglect.  There were only two people working there when I went there a couple of nights ago, and they were out of BACON.  I gently chided the man on the register, how could a burger joint run out of bacon?  He said the manager didn't order enough.  And I guess it was impossible for a shift manager to take $40 out of the till and drive 3-5 miles to buy a bunch of bacon.  Pretty lame, IMO.\n\nThat's pretty trivial, but it is indicative of a problem.\n\nThere were other indicators.  First, the dining area hadn't been bussed.  Tables were dirty, and that is not good.  Second, the soda fountain had not been properly cleaned.  Several levers were sticky with syrup, and that level of stickiness takes some time to build up.  So proper cleaning procedure hadn't been followed for some time.  Third, again attesting to the dining room not being properly maintained, they were all but empty of the little cups that you load with ketchup for your fries.  They have two large bins for them and probably less than a dozen total available between the two.\n\nTo me, these indicate a total lack of concern from the owner/manager.  The franchise is not being properly supervised, procedures are not being followed, and that is a problem.\n\nLet's talk about my meal.  My burger was cooked properly and done quickly.  There were two orders ahead of me and the woman at the grill seemed to be getting orders out speedily.  My cheddar cheese burger tasted good, even without the extra-crispy bacon that I wanted.  I've always liked the flavor of a Fatburger, it must be the meat and fat mix plus seasoning.  The fries, though hot, were a little under-done.  And the soda mix was not correct, I think too much soda water.  I did not get a refill, I nursed the one drink through my meal and got icewater when I left.  This is, after all, Phoenix summer.\n\nI would give them three stars for food, if they'd had the bacon I might have given them four.\n\nSo why am I giving them two stars overall?\n\nA couple at a table had a problem with their meal.  I don't know what, but the woman was talking about how she couldn't eat it.  Maybe the order was incorrect or they included something on her burger that she had a sensitivity to.  Regardless, the workers did not satisfy them, as a result the woman complained throughout their meal and said 'This is going up on Yelp as soon as I get home!'  Well, it hasn't yet, so she either calmed down and realized that she was perhaps overreacting or she just didn't get around to it.  But the workers did nothing to placate them.  Any small business, especially food, needs repeat business, and they lost those two customers that night.  Maybe the workers didn't have the authority to satisfy the people with a future comp'd meal, which would indicate that the owners/managers have a weak set of procedures in place that produced dissatisfaction.\n\nI got the feeling that the place was under-staffed.  I never saw more than two people, and neither came in to the dining room to clean.  After the unhappy couple left without busing their table, that table sat uncleaned for over half an hour until I left.  But on top of that, they had very little business that evening.  I arrived around 7pm and stayed for an hour.  One person came in after that picking up an order to go, one family came in just as I was leaving.  That's not enough business to justify staying open.\n\nMaybe it was a slow night.  Maybe they were shot-staffed that night.  Maybe management is on vacation.  Regardless, this location's owner and management need to take a serious look at how this site is operating, because otherwise, they're going to start losing money if they're not already.\n\nFor me, there are lots of places to get hamburgers, including Smashburger, The Habit, Steakenburger, Wineburger, etc.  There's lots of places to get good burgers, and all of those locations have better numbers than this Fatburger."
1,"Vegas weekend with my girl and this was our first stop to eat.  In summary, we ordered the recommendations of yelpers and our server and the food was just alright.  Our server was great and attentive, but the food was just ok.  Not worth getting into the details, I will not be going back."
0,Don't go there total waste of time and money.  The door guys are rude liars. Ten dollar cover even after 1:30
4,Thomas and his awesome machine cleaned our carpets like nobody else has been able to.  He took the time to come in and move furniture and ensure all of it was moved back.  He is professional and have great prices.  We highly recommend him.
3,"Nothing special I think this place tastes like all the other places I've eaten at but nonetheless, it's still tasted good! I had the Salmon Special which was very tasty, I loved the sauce that came with my salmon and the fact that I had a small dish of coleslaw as well. My friend had udon and it smelled and looked so good! I'll have to try it next time!"
1,"**-yawn** mediocre pizza, service is okay some days , other days you can tell someone can't wait to go home. . I Only order here when I'm broke.. \n  The drivers are usually cool ( the reason for 2 stars), but the store personnel,  could use some motivation. .  Management needs to step their game up!  (Trickle effect) lived in this jurisdiction 3 years and it's the same ole same ole every time."
4,"If you want to go to a clean place: don't come here.\nIf you mind seeing fingerprints in your bread: don't come here.\nIf you wan't an amazing sandwich filled with pittsburgh history and tastiness: come here.\nIf you want a pittsburgh experience: come here.\nIf you are watching your weight: don't come here.\n\nI love this place. Not healthy in the least, but you get awesome food with friendly people. If you are a tourist, you have to come here."
2,"Good find for anyone living in the West Valley or just visitng. Quality is just as good if not better than Starbucks. Coffee is superb and the food is excellent. They even have gelato!\n\nThe one problem I have is with their service. They have a restaurant type service, which does not seem to work in their favor. When you sit down, it takes 15 minutes to be greeted and another 30 to get food. In order to avoid this is to order at the counter and then be seated. \n\nI recommend this place solely for the quality of their coffee and food"
2,"We lucked out because we were planning to visit their regular location, but their \""food truck\"" was conveniently in the \""food court\"" of the Arizona Centennial Celebration.  We were quite excited since we had seen them on TV, but I think perhaps our expectations were a little bit too high.  It's good ice cream, but nothing all that spectacular, nothing that I could necessarily go out of my way for.  We had the bananas fosters and salted caramel.  Just like others have mentioned, it's kinda expensive for what you get."
2,"I came here last Friday for a friend's birthday (sorta) dinner, and besides the service, which was pretty good for the size of our party, the food didn't seem to be that great. It does sit in a convenient location, since it's across from Marquee's entrance.\n\nI guess it might just be that I've had more than enough of my share of burgers the past week, but the classic burger didn't have any real stand out flavor to it.  The steak fries were okay, but not much different from something  you'd get from Red Robin. \n\nThe only thing that got me interested in the place was their selection of beers. I actually spent more time deciding on what beer I wanted to drink the on what I wanted to eat, probably if I spent more time on deciding what to eat I might've enjoyed it more.  Anyway I ordered the Red Fox Stout, and it had someone of a similar taste to Guiness but with interesting flavors of what seemed similar to wine.\n\nFrom the other reviews, it's seems like the place has better things to offer, so it's possible that I'd give this place a shot again. But there are other great restaurants in the area, so I wouldn't force myself to eat here if I couldn't decide on anything to eat."
3,"I love that I can walk to this place from my apartment.\n\nI also love the yummy (but very pricey) drinks. And I love the ambience.\n\nIn my four visits, the sushi has been exceptional (twice), good (once), and bad (once).\n\nI would highly recommend any of their spicy rolls, particularly the Spicy Hana. And if you're looking to save a buck, their reverse happy hour is killer.\n\nWork on the consistency and I'll give you 5 stars."
0,Gustavs bar smelled so bad we had to leave-disgusting--Very bad moldy/sweaty/stale beer smell: the 'dancers' at the tables were so lame and acted like they didn't want to be there:  I expected a higher class in this casino-but it was as low as you can go. May as well go to Fremont street
4,"Love their burgers. Have not tried anything else except onion rings and fries, but this is my 'THE' place for burgers."
3,"I miss this place so bad. First off, the calzone's are amazing, the outer crust is crunch but not burned and the interior is filled with warm fillings of your choice ( I like spinich and pepperoni) and really good tomato sauce. The pizza, fries and wings are all very good and the fried zucchini is fantastic. The waitstaff have always been good to me and the prices are pretty decent. A sidenote, try the ranch dressing... really fresh and not too thick or heavy. Delicious."
4,"One of the best dinning and takeout options in uptown. Federal Pizza has a beautiful interior and patio. Unsurprisingly the menu is mostly pizza but they also offer some variety in the form of pastas, sandwiches and salads. Dining in is a great experience and the take out is quick and just as delicious. I prefer dining in because they have a great happy hour special. \n\nThe Big Star pizza is a must try for anyone who looking for something completely unique. It is my favorite menu item complete with all the veggies and meats one could ask for. Perfection! I have also had the Manifesto and Casanova. Both of which were also very good. As far as appetizers the green olives and the avocado are also great choices."
3,"I didn't check Yelp before booking this hotel and am surprised at the low rating.  I stayed in a King room on the fifth floor.  It was clean, nicely decorated, and had plenty of floor space.  I'd say it is one of the better hotel rooms I've stayed at in a while.\n\nI love the bathroom area and the translucent sliding door concept. However, our door had trouble sliding all the way so we had to push/pull it with force.  Even then, there was still a slight gap so whenever somebody peed or went number 2, you heard EVERYTHING!! Definitely, not something I wish to hear when I'm trying to sleep.  It also does not have a ventilation system so you'll have to deal with other people's smell.\n\nThe hotel lobby was clean and the concierge was always nice.  They also do currency exchange, one to one.  The hotel had free parking and wifi. It was not difficult finding parking. I didn't eat at the restaurant so I can't review on that. I walked by both indoor and outdoor swimming pools.  It isn't big and they do not have a hot tub.\n\nOne bad thing about this hotel is the elevator. There is only ONE elevator in this elevator and it is super slow!!\n\nThis hotel is located right by the Olympic Park so depending on where your room is, you'll get to see the tower.\n\nBased on my experience at this hotel, I'd stay here again if I returned to Montreal and didn't care for location.  It's about a 20 minute drive to the downtown/ Old Montreal area."
0,"We've been going here for about 10 years, as we live not too far away.  I'm assuming there is relatively new management (looks all Chinese), because the food quality, the service, and the staff are all very \""low rent\"" now.  Today we visited again...and the waitress was an overweight hispanic woman who looked like the maid.  She couldn't speak good English, she had no idea about the menu, and brought the wrong food out.  She offered \""thousand island or ranch\"" dressing for the salad.  This place always has the Japanese ginger dressing...we had to ask, and then she brought it out.  I complained to the manager (owner?), and he chuckled it off saying she was from the kitchen as they are short staffed.  Really?  \nClearly, we will NOT be going back to this place.  It was to the point that I was concerned about the cleanliness of the food."
0,"What's the point, really?\n\nIn the San Francisco area, there used to be a metaphysical shop called \""The Psychic Eye\"".  There are still Psychic Eyes in the Las Vegas area.  When they still had stores in the Bay Area, I used to go there, referring to it as \""the Costco of Occultism\"" because they carried so much incredible stuff.  When I first stopped by the Vision Quest building, my first impression from seeing the outside was, \""It looks like Psychic Eye!\""  With that, I went inside, and my attitude changed from hopeful and curious, to confused, disappointed, and actually rather miffed.\n\nPsychic Eye had EVERYTHING from bulk incenses and oils to books (the Crowley was in a locked cabinet) to magical blades to wall sconces(!) to jewelry and any kind of occulty paraphernalia you could or couldn't think of.\n\nWhen I walked into Vision Quest, I was greeted by. . .bookshelves.  Lots and lots of bookshelves.  On these shelves, there were lots of copies of the same book laid face out for one or more rows so as to give them the illusion of looking full.  Had they been placed spine out, most of the bookshelves would have been substantially less than half filled, and the books that they did carry were largely crap.  I literally wandered from bookshelf to bookshelf looking for something interesting at each one, and was amazed at how few books of real quality I could find.  There was a small area in the center of the store with some crystals, and there was a case near the register with a little jewelry and some other non-descript stuff.  A few shelves and displays were also dedicated to 8 1/2 by 11 colored sheets of paper describing the specialties of the psychics and mediums who work at the site.  They aren't really selling crap here in the store, so this must be their main source of income.\n\nThis store is BIG, and really well-maintained.  They obviously put a LOT of money into the large Tarot card paintings that decorate the walls.  This place could be an occult powerhouse to rival Psychic Eye if they had the inventory to make it happen.  Instead, they have this huge, beautiful facility understocked with lousy books and a few crystals.  It was like using an ornate, sterling silver serving platter to serve a cold Quarter Pounder missing a bun.\n\nOn top of that, the sales lady just stayed by the register the whole time counting money.  We must have been in that store for 40 minutes, and all the while she didn't make eye contact, didn't even look up at us, didn't greet us, ask us if we needed help, or talk to us at all.   In addition, she had one music track playing on repeat over the speakers the whole time we were in there.\n\nVision Quest looks like it was really great at some time in the past.  Unfortunately, that time has come and gone.  From the terrible inventory to the non-existent customer service, few businesses say \""get out\"" to their customers more than this.\n\nWhat is the point, really?"
4,"I've lived a stone's throw from this place for 3 years now, and just today got to check it out for the first time.  \n\nIt's a simple deli that had a good sized lunch crowd.  I had the \""sack lunch\"" combo that included a small sandwich, chips, cookie and a drink for $5 (+tax)!  I had the classic italian and it hit the spot!  Perfect size for lunch, didn't leave the place painfully stuffed.  I'll be back for more!"
2,"For me 3 stars means A-OK...I would eat here again with no problem though I may not rush there or rave about it. In fairness I am not a huge fan of buffets and this one is certainly one of the biggest I have ever seen. There are at least 5 or 6 different stations - salad, dessert, seafood, meats, eclectic mix, Asian.\n\nLike any decent buffet, many of the dishes were very good, lots were okay and some were not for me at all. I felt the food was kept fresh and replenished often, I enjoyed seeing the staff behind the food as I could ask questions, get recommendations etc... One of the things I liked best was the small size of certain dishes - enough for a bite or two which encouraged me to try lots of things I may not have tasted otherwise. \n\nThe best station for me was the salad area, the staff was friendly and very attentive. Dessert was quite disappointing. A little pricey for a buffet but you are in Vegas!!"
4,"This is the type of place I've been looking for!! I am an Orange County, CA girl that have recently moved to Vegas. I get my nails done every 2 weeks at my place. Its Cheap but QUALITY SERVICE! Also the only place that hasn't sliced my flesh. So you can understand that me branching out to find something new is frightening for me. Also I paid only $28 for a mani and pedi (their spa package).\n\nLuxury Nails and Spa. HOLY! MOLY! BEST IN VEGAS! For local shop for sure. You get a mani-pedi for $30 and it includes hot stone massage for your foot AND callus removal included. Which usually is an additional $5 anywhere. \n\nThe location is kind of in the middle of nowhere where the businesses are slower, but for an asian salon it is cleaner than most. Which is important because some are...well sadly.. not hole in the walls but shit on the walls. So it was very important to me to share this since Escape Nail Salon has the best rating for a local salon. I had a guy do my nails there and it TOOK FOREVER and cut my Toe!! blood! I hate blood! ahh. That happened at the 2nd chance I gave them. First time a girl took almost 2 hours just to do my manicure. I'm like.. wtf is going on here? I gots to go.\n\nSo I hope this helped someone find a wonderful local nail salon and a price that they should be!! Not $40 to just do your nails on the strip. YUCK!"
3,I have such fond memories of Orange Julius from when I was a kid.  And you know what they are still really really good. The only reason I gave them a four? It's kind of expensive!!!
2,"New York vs. Montreal bagels. The everlasting debate.\n\nQuite simply, I think you will forever be loyal to whatever bagel you have been raised to eating. As a native New Yorker, I was excited to go to Montreal to try these out, and Fairmount Bagel was apparently the place to go. During weekend mornings, expect to wait on a line that goes out the door, but that doesn't say much considering the standing area in the place is as small as a closet. That's not an exaggeration.\n\nI went with the classic sliced lox and plain cream cheese on a plain bagel. It was tasty! For those who are unfamiliar, Montreal(-ian?) bagels are a little smaller, and made with honey, to give them a distinctive sweet flavor, and have a noticeably chewy texture to them. Very different from their New York counterpart.\n\n-2 for the no seating, not even any standing space. And because I while I didn't totally love it, it was still pretty good. \n\nIf in new in Montreal and have any appreciation for bagels whatsoever, Fairmount Bagels is a must."
1,"The best this place has to offer is its atmosphere -- it's sumptuous, perfectly lit, calming. We went there last night with friends for Arizona Restaurant Week, excited to try out one of the new kids in town. The evening, though, started out poorly with a \""Have you been here before?\"" question from the server as the first words out of his mouth. Why ask? Is he going to treat us differently depending on our answer? \n\nWe then mentioned that we were there for the Restaurant Week experience. Obviously not hearing us, he proceeded to tell us all about the #1 selling items on the regular menu, including the Kobe beef. \""I don't eat beef,\"" two of us said, which he ignored, and kept on talking. Is management making this chap say all these things or is this his choice to up our bill and his tip? If you're only going to talk about the #1 selling item on your menu... in all categories... why bother having several options in each category available? \n\nLook, I can read and can afford to eat there. I've eaten at restaurants on 5 continents. I know what I'm doing. Let me read the menu in peace, ask questions if I've got them, and order what I want, despite it's #1 or #7 best-selling status. This is why I go out to dinner.\n\nLastly, while the food was good, they have the nerve to charge $13 for the tiniest martini I've probably ever seen. \n\nMehhhh...."
3,"Huzzah! I finally got to try Grouchy John's, but I don't fully understand the grouchy part. I was met by an incredibly friendly staff when I arrived.  This place is much smaller than I had anticipated, but they make up for that in charm. From Star Wars decor, waving cat ornaments, and various works of art that were featured on an episode of Portlandia (If you know the show, you know what I'm talking about.) And not to mention the uniquely crafted beverages, Grouchy John's is an oasis in a desert of corporate coffee."
2,Great to grab a drink before your flight and watch sports on the many tv's. Don't order food or you will be sorely disappointed
4,"Lox Stock & Bagel offers great food in a friendly atmosphere.  From the bagels to the lox to the cream cheese everything is tasty and fresh. For a great meal of bagels, don't miss this!!"
2,"We ate here the last evening we stayed at Circus, Circus.  It wasn't horrible.   We just walked in, no line.  The drink and dessert lanes were nice.   Salad bar was basic but fresh tasting.  \n\nThey had several different set ups-a fried chicken and fixings, a turkey and fixings, one kids foods-pizza type stuff, a carving station with roast beef, turkey and pork roast I think, a fish/seafood section nothing to get too excited about, and a taco area.  \n\nWe ate here the night after a rather disappointing dinner at the Garden Grill. The buffet was actually an improvement.  \n\nIf you are staying in the hotel,  too tired after a long day of walking and if there isn't a long line it's ok.  It wouldn't be that great if you had to wait in line. And definately wouldn't make a special trip to visit."
2,"Just a little update -- we were greeted at the door by a very friendly \""host\"" and he mentioned that we \""should find a table before we order as it gets busy\"" which totally discredit the way they used to do things. HUGE IMPROVEMENT! Thanks!\n\nANOTHER UPDATE: As of the 25th, apparently when it starts getting cramped, a nice employee will come by and \""reserve\"" a table for you. I guess this is supposed to ease the anxiety of \""where to sit, where to sit\""...It's a nice addition. But, I still think a place like this deserves servers."
3,"Great place to really experience the history of Montreal, the history of Canada, and food that has been made the same for over 70 years. \n\nSpecial with Kraft was delicious. In front of me within 1 minute of my order. \nNot too salty and light on the mustard. I added more mustard and it hit the spot.\n\nChatted with the owner about the show being on The Mind of A Chef with David Chang. We talked about the history of the place and it was clear the amount of pride the family takes in running the shop. \n\nThe big surprise for me was the original soda fountain they have. \nBest pineappple soda I ever had. Cherry looked amazing as well. \n\nA definite must-visit, if going to Montreal."
3,"This is an excellent restaurant that I believe may be run by Korean folks who bring their own flavors to the meals.  The seaweed is a little tastier, the tempura batter and sauce are sweeter, they may put sesame oil in food, etc.  I am Japanese and insisted on staying with a more traditional Japanese cuisine but after trying Mikado's food, i'm hooked!  If you can handle a little spice, I recommend the STST roll (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna).  Their sushi is creative, fresh and tasty.  The prices are excellent and the service is prompt and friendly.  Go check it out, you won't be disappointed!"
1,"I don't know his name but the guy taking to-go orders was so rude to my group and I. We were walking in and I went to get a boba tea and the guy was like, \""is this your party?\"" I was like, \""yes.\"" \n\n\""Are you sure? This whole party is yours?\"" \n\nI confirmed again. It seemed like it was an issue even though I told him we were getting to go. \n\nSo I told him what I wanted and he have me my amount so I take out my wallet and he's like, \""do you have cash? make sure you have cash.\""\n\nI looked at him like, \""I do?\""\n\nWhy would he say that as he gives me my total even though he there's no sign or anything? He said it really rude too.\n\nLuckily my boba was delicious or I'd burn this place to the ground. \n \nI doubt I'll be coming back. People at Volcano Tea are nicer."
3,"Simple concept: choose your option of car wash, go through the wash tunnel and have them clean the insides. \n\nI've been here twice now and have had a good experience. I always choose the $20 option which includes a wash, tire detail, hand dry, vacuum, dash shine, window wipe down and other stuff I can't remember. They offer other packages ranging from $8-$100+. The guys wiping down my car have always been nice and thorough with their cleaning. They have me inspect anything before driving off the lot. You even get a free tree air freshener. The only reason for the one star being taken off was due to my last visit and the guy yelling at me across the parking lot that my car was ready. Like really, you can't walk the 30 ft. and tell me yourself? \n\nP.S. Don't feel pressured by the windshield guy to have your chips fixed."
1,"I'm giving this two stars because the food is good. It is also reasonably priced. It is much better than fast food and not even much more. However, don't come here for good service. The lady at the counter has been rude to me every time I have come in. Even friends of mine have said she's been rude. I've been in the food and restaurant industry as well as management and if she was even half as nasty to me as she has been I would fire her on the spot. It's unacceptable to treat customers this way and a great way to lose business. Also their website is inconsistent with what they actually have. Basic stuff here.\nI'll try my luck at another location, perhaps."
2,"I ate here on a late morning/early afternoon before heading out.  The food was good for the most part and it had an \""ok\"" selection of food.  It had the usual Vegas buffet staples of salad, fruit, aisian, desserts, ice cream, etc.  I didn't have anything that I fell in love with, yet I didn't have anything that I brought to the table that I didn't eat either.  \nMy buffet was complimentary with my room so I didn't pay and it was satisfying for the 'price,' yet if you want a great buffet, I would suggest going elsewhere (Rio and Ceaser's are at the top of my list)."
1,"The Skinny: picturesque ambience makes for a nice relaxing morning but the food definitely had some hits and misses(2) Service: efficient as always (4), value: given the tableside service for some items with buffet-styled appys, grilled foods and desserts, you can probably find a better deal at a buffet for $59/person (price includes live entertainment tax, juices and sodas). (2).\n\nMy hubby's been dying to try this place out for a while so we decided to give it a try. The old school Country Club air can't be beat as the restaurant overlooks the beautifully manicured 18 holed grass golf course. A live band serenades you as you marvel at this green oasis. Service is quiet and efficient which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nThat being said, the food just doesn't match up to the promise of its ambience and staff. There are two distinct components: the tableside menu (unlimited ordering) which is prepared a la minute, and the buffet consisting of grilled, cold and dessert items.\n\nI asked the hubby what his favourite thing on the cold buffet table. He said that it was the peppercorn encrusted goat cheese with a side of the candied pecans. 'Nuff said when the best thing on the buffet is something that require little to no preparation. (FYI - they did have a plentiful cold seafood bar with fresh oysters, smoked fish, crab and ceviche. That being said, the hubs and I tend to be leery of seafood that's been sitting on a buffet table). We did try the corn chowder but found it too cloyingly sweet.\n\nThe grill offered many options including brined pork (pretty tasty), shrimp with chipotle sauce (also pretty tasty), roasted corn (tasted the same as the succotash), roasted potatoes (okay), ancho-chile encrusted turkey (dry as hell)and filet of beef (chewier than jerky).\n\nWe did sample some of the kiddie table items and they were decidedly mediocre. The slider was overly dry while the mac n' cheese was overly watery. (FYI - no fries or potato chips to go with the slider makes this a bit of a bleh! I imagine for the younger set.)\n\nLoving pastries, I opted instead for the carb heavy items. Although the croissant was flaky, the danishes pastry did not hold up to the fruit filling. The little muffins were overly dry and unappetizing. The granola lost it's satisfying crunch after sitting too long in the yogurt/berry parfait. Major fail for a continental breakfast fiend like me.\n\nTableside, we ordered the BBQ pulled pork eggs benny, the French Toast Bread pudding, Chicken Paillard, Grilled Hot Dog with a side of corn succotash. \n\nThe best was the BBQ pork eggs benny - it was literally a messy mouthful of guilty pleasure. Imagine a bacon-onion-cheese biscuit topped with BBQ pulled pork and poached egg. Then top it off with a playful chipotle hollandaise. It was pretty good but sadly the only thing we wanted to finish. All the other items were nothing we would return for sadly (corn succotash = so-so flavours with too much cream, french toast bread pudding = overly dense textural nightmare, chicken paillard = bland, grilled hot dog = dehydrated weenie with no snap and an overly large bun).\n\nThe nail on the coffin was the dessert table. Of all the desserts, I only wanted a second bite of the La Reve cake - a lovely concoction of chocolate ganache and praline crisp on the bottom. The opera cake was okay. The macaroons, the coconut cream pie, the chocolate eclair...they all had some textural issues especially with the marshmallow topping on the pie.\n\nIf you consider the AYCE tableside service, this place is a great deal. However given the hit-or-miss quality of the food you're given, it just doesn't quite live up to expectations. A 2.5 -starred review."
1,"Coffee was weak and they didn't have any of the milk, creamer, etc. out even though it was 9:00 AM and they had been open a while. Asked for it and got aggravated at the wait so walked to my gate and used cream from the Starbuck's there instead."
0,"Service was alright. At first I ordered the beef tips but that had more fat on them than meat and the taste otherwise was ok. I returned this for the ribs which did \""fall off the bone\"" and are somewhat tasty provided you add a heap of bbq sauce with them. The sides I ordered were the mac and cheese and dirty rice. *sigh* the mac and cheese was watery and bland and the rice was dry and tasteless. The manager came out and introduced himself which I thought was nice. The best part of my meal was the strawberry lemonade I ordered which reminded me of koolaid 0_o. Now on to my husband's meal... he ordered the brisket which came out looking like SPAM! Lol this place is mediocre at best and everything tasted as if it was frozen then warmed up in the microwave.. yuck. Needless to say the facility was pretty clean which is always a plus. Now the best part... Me and my husband are still having the runs from eating at this place 5 days ago. Never again smh."
1,"I guess this is what you should expect poolside at Aria. Windy, overpriced bad food. $20 burgers and 1 lb. hot dogs that scare small children. Slow service and secluded location make this cafe a must miss. If your hungry and eager to be poolside change locations all together. Interesting items on menu like country friend bacon but unfortunately just not good. Go to the Hard Rock for some quality poolside entertainment and food."
3,"Best food since we have been in Vegas. Good prices, friendly staff."
2,"I liked the 1950s-diner ambience of this joint. It was crowded and bustling when we went, though we didn't have to wait for a table, unlike people in larger groups. It seems to be a popular weekend brunch spot.\n\nThe service was friendly and prompt and our waiter picked up that I was vegan (without me telling him) and helpfully told us that some things (such as the rolls) weren't dairy-free. He substituted toast and English muffins for us.\n\nI found my vegan tofu scramble with potato hash to be decent, but nothing spectacular. My friend thought the same of his \""Sloppy Faux\"" sandwich which came with waffle fries. The prices are reasonable at around $7-10 a dish and the portion sizes are good. They do offer at least eight or nine vegan-friendly dishes from scrambles to burgers to meatloaf.\n\nMadison needs a place like this which offers vegan brunch foods so I appreciate Blue Plate is around. The vibe is good and they have parking. But the quality of the food could stand to improve a bit."
0,"Never again!\n\nThis is long overdue, but I had a fabulous experience at Fletchers today and was reminded of the antithesis that is Big O on Rural Road.\n\nI went in here in May for an oil change, since it was 2 blocks from my apartment and advertised student discounts. \n\nFirst, they don't even DO the discount unless you're getting $100 worth of work, and it's a shitty 15% I believe. I'm used to 20% and up.\n\nThen, it took them an HOUR to do my oil. A freaking HOUR and one other car there. \n\nThe guy then informs me that my rear brake rotors are \""paper thin\"" and cautions me that if I drive to work in Ahwatukee on the I-10, that they will surely fail and cause a serious accident. Huge use of scare tactics, so I ignored him, but he was just ADAMANT that they were very dangerous to drive on. He then quoted me $350 to fix them - a mechanic friend not an hour later told me it was about $50 for those parts. Ripoff!\nSide note: This was May, this is October and 10k miles later, and NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. Uh huh, bad rotors, whatever.\n\nThe last straw though, was when I was paying and asked about the student discount. The counter is high and I had my wallet open on it, not thinking much of it. At the time I was a waitress and in between bank runs carried a lot of cash. The guy tells me the aforementioned policy, stands on his freaking tiptoes to look into my wallet, and say \""Look at all that cash, you don't need a discount anyway!\""\n\nThat irked me beyond all belief, because I worked my butt off being society's ***** at a high-end restaurant, and the nerve of him to imply I could afford to be ripped off was disgusting.\n\nGo to Fletchers in Ahwatukee for any work, and ANYWHERE ELSE for oil changes. Seriously, this place sucks."
4,"Stayed at Paris for the first two nights, and then moved to Tropicana . I was really impressed when I stepped into the hotel. Great services, large hotel room, good views! I like it better than the Paris, actually. I should stay here from the first day I got Las Vegas. I will come back again, obsolescently."
0,"Been there two times. First time was the bomb, younger guy heck of nice.  2nd time not so great younger gal kind of rude. Food is great but need to work on customer service. :("
0,We stopping in on Saturday Sept 1 at about 2:PM the sign said they closed in the afternoon and reopened for dinner a couple of hours later. Since we were there about 15 minutes before the closing time and just wanted a sandwich we went in. There were about 4 employees at the counter working on prep for dinner and about three other customers. No one greeted us but they had to have seen us you just can't miss someone standing at the front door. Eventually we just sat outselves. Still no one would make eye contact or approach us. My partner went to the counter and got a menu and the woman at the counter said she didn't see us. She would have to be blind not to have seen us. We ordered a sandwich from the self service counter. It was not impressive just meat and cheese on bread with lettuce. The potato salad was nice but a pretty small portion for the price. \nWe definetly felt unwanted. If you want to strart prepping for dinner at 1:30 then close at 1:30.
0,Got food poisoning here yesterday--it was either from the lettuce or the shrimp dumpling
2,"I'm a big fan of sushi to the point where I'll eat it several nights a week if available and economical. When I was craving it particularly one night, we checked local sushi places and decided to head down to RA on Mill Ave.\n\nOne, the decor is modern chic influenced by classic Japanese reds and blacks. We chose to sit at the sushi bar rather than a table. The seats were comfortable and at the correct height for sitting (unlike some places I've been too), but the ambient temperature was a little chill. Not sure if it was because we were seated at the sushi bar however.\n\nTwo, our server was pleasant and accomodating. Although after taking our initial order he all but disappeared for the rest of the meal. I was lucky to flag him down for a refill of water and to ask a question. Our sushi server was very pleasant and available, even while working on someone else's food. He told us a little bit about how he got started in sushi preparation and was conversational, but not to the point of interrupting our personal conversation with each other.\n\nThree, food. Good quality. I had tuna nigiri (my favorite) and he had the tina roll; we shared a side of edamame. The edamame was delicious, prepared just right. My nigiri was good quality tuna, but the size of the portion was a tad on the small size - especially for the price. Most places I'd have expected four for the price I paid. My boyfriend's tuna roll seemed a bit on the small side as well. We both ended up needing to order twice, making the meal more expensive than I had anticipated but not unworth it.\n\nOverall my experience was mediocre. While the quality was good, the expense was not. It was wholly memorable but I wouldn't sneer at going back. If I were in the Mill Ave area and wanted sushi, I would go here since I'm familiar with it. If I were just in Tempe and wanted sushi, I'd probably try some place new.\n\nDecent but nothing to write home about at this time."
0,"This is the worst place to eat. All of the food was nasty. Never, ever, ever, again!!!"
2,"We went on bookit.com and decided to be a little spontaneous so we did the Mystery Booking where for $22 you don't know what hotel you'll get to you actually pay/book the hotel.  But they guarantee it's off the strip and at least a 3.5 star hotel.  We got the Stratosphere.  I thought ok, I never been here before, should be fun.  My husband didn't seem that excited though.\n\nThe hotel was nice, we upgraded for an extra $20/night for the hot tub/wide screen room (originally we got a standard room).  The room was nice, nothing too different than what I seen before.  The hot tub was in the bathroom which also served as a shower too.  It fits two people comfortable side by side.  It felt nice after a 3 hr car ride the first night.  The 2nd night, I was over it maybe because my husband had turned it up so hot.  I couldn't breathe.  \n\nThe bed was hard that it made my back hurt.  Somebody took our \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign off of door on the 2nd day.  I didn't like the shady looking apartment/hotel across the street.  It looked scary like we had taken a wrong turn somewhere.  \n\nI don't know if I would come back here again especially when there are so many other hotels that we would still like to try on the strip.  But not too bad for $44/night Mystery Booking."
1,"WARNING: I tendered a credit card, and then another, and then another, and their software reads them all as DEBIT CARDS!!! This means they'll try to reserve enormous amounts of your credit card limit, should you choose to let them do this to you. I'm told by the manager of the site, that this has been happening for three months (today's Jan 7th) and what they're doing is dubious AT BEST. I finally found a credit card that lacks a debit stripe on it, and it worked. The credit card is also your last mile of insurance for something that happens to the car, so make sure your insurance is in order (and I'm guessing that this is the rationale behind their software faux pas). \n\nI've been coming, otherwise, to this location since it opened because the cars are good, and the staff is friendly (if overworked). I liked these guys; haven't used them in about a year. Shame that they pull this kind of trick. My personal advice: find someone else if you're not sure you have a credit-only card. \n\nI like these guys otherwise, but they admit to a major soap opera if your credit card has the debit card magstripe. Hopefully, they change it soon."
1,"Party of Six:  Only reason for two stars is that our party really enjoyed sitting outside on the patio otherwise would be one star.  I ordered the beef tenderloin.  I specially described how I wanted it cooked.  I kept asking, since I like it pink but without blood, if that was doable.  I said I would be happy to change order if this might be difficult.  I was guaranteed it would be cooked to order.  It was raw.  They took it back.  I sat there while the other five ate for almost 10 minutes before it was returned.  It came back burnt on the outside and still bloody inside.  The first bite was so salty I had to spit out.  Didn't take a second bite!  They did come and ask if ok but removed after their 'flashlight' proved that it was still bloody.  They did take my meal off the bill BUT!!!...if a Chef can't cook a steak to order...ANY WAY it is ordered...I question the ability!"
0,"I don't understand what the big hype is about, long drive thru lines , bumper stickers , t shirts , souvenir cups? I tried this place for the first time Friday night , girls at the counter are rude or ignorant or both , I got the 8 chicken strip combo with fries , the rest of my family got #2's which I think was the two planks and fried shrimp , everything was cold , while ordering I watched food go straight from a box that was frozen straight into the frier , everything was just bland , unless you drenched it with Pete's sauce , blech ."
0,"My husband and I tried to go here once and never will again. Let me explain...\n\nI was 8 months pregnant and craving some Olive Garden, which I always love. They had built a new building for this location and we saw people going in so we stopped for dinner. We were walking in and a worker asked if we had a reservation. I told her no not yet and she turned us away saying it was a soft opening and it was only for those with reservations. Understandable I guess.. I was sad but we left. Thing was... Not even twenty minutes later my husband gets a call from his work friend, Dustin. He said \""Go to the new Olive Garden location! They're opening for the first time and gave us free dinner!\"" My husband told him the story of how we were JUST turned away and asked Dustin if they had had reservations. He said no they just walked in. I was appalled. If you're going to turn people away, that's fine. But turn EVERYONE away then. I was so mad. You lost a paying customer that would've gone back many times. Now I drive farther to the arrowhead location where I enjoy taking my business. And I was super pregnant! Give a girl some food!"
1,"Overpriced average food.  Great space and location but it missed mark again.  I had special which was mahi mahi.  It was a 5 oz filet they probably got from teeter for $6.  It came with steamed broccoli , about 1/4 of a cup max.  No starch.  The fish had no seasoning and was pan seared.  It's what any bad home cook would have done but less food.  It was $28!   Seriously?  I want to like this place but its mediocre food with a Dilworth premium.  Wine prices are good and artichoke app is excellent but a little oily.  Would go to bar again but after 3 tries to like restaurant , I'm done."
4,"I love Liberty Market. I grew up in Gilbert and remember when this was a small grocery store. I've been wanting to check this place out since the conversion and I'm so glad I finally stopped by. \n\nIt was perfect. This place just feels like home. Casual, but warm. When we walked in my friend and I were lost and didn't know where to start. Luckily one of the staff quickly handed us menus and told us where to order. \n\nI had a couple of caramel iced lattes and the Liberty Bowl. I loved both. The Liberty Bowl came with 4 big meatballs in marinara sauce and and two slices of toasted bread. It was so hard narrowing down my choice because there were so many delicious looking items on the menu and the baked goods display kept calling my name, but I resisted. Next time I think I'll just give in and have a slice of red velvet or carrot cake, or a cup cake or a slice of zucchini bread or a sticky bun. So much to choose from. I would love to come back here and have a coffee and sit and enjoy the atmosphere at the espresso bar. \n\nLoved all the different themes in the bathroom stalls. You have to check each one out. Joe was there and stopped by each table to see how everyone was doing. We spent so much time here chatting and catching up. It's a great place to come and hang out. I will be back soon."
1,"The lunch here is mediocre at best.  Bland and unhealthy, the ambiance is nothing special.  The best I could say is that it's not very expensive (though you can walk around the corner north on Clark and get the same food for half the price)."
2,I grew up near this place. The food was never great but we went in because there was a pile of comics on the end of the counter for kids to read because the NDG Paperback was next store. From what I remember 30Yrs ago was that they made their living fronting all the residents of halfway houses (  A big N.D.G. industry ) meals until their welfare checks arrived. At some point in the 80's some of my  'Rich'  friends from Hampstead & Cote-St-Luc decided it was a cool place to slum it on Sundays for Brunch and the place has been going like gangbusters ever since. WTF!?!
0,"If I could give this place a 1/2 a star I would. I never will get anyone who thinks $10 for a burger in this town is 'OK' or an eight dollar shake. I used a groupon and it still cost my wife and I $20+ bucks. There's  way better places in this town to have a out of this world burger, and folks this ain't one of them. \n  First if all I hate spending this kind of dough when I'm not being served. Second our food sat in a window for 5 min while some guy took over 3 orders. \""really guy\"" come on. This location sucked ball ass too. Place Station sucks. Non-Union. It shows.  I have another shit-poun for this place I won't be using. Johnny Rockers. More like Johnny Crockers. I was like why do people think this is so great? I should of read the Yelp reviews before I bought 2 groupons to this shit hole. Won't happen again. After reading the reviews people had the same complaints. Way over priced. \n People always think the more expensive it is the better it is. Not in this case. I felt the more I got ripped off."
4,"I LOVE this place! I work right around the corner, so I love ordering from them! I usually always get the caprese salad with extra bread, which is YUMMY, but make sure you've got some minty gum...it's drenched in garlic, which I love! Today, I ordered the greek salad and a cannoli. I loved the salad. This was the first time I've had a cannoli, so I don't have anything to compare that to, but I really enjoyed it. :) Definitely a place to order from!"
3,In my opinion it may be the best burger and frys I have had. The cheese is always perfectly melted and the jalape\u00f1os I get are always tasting fresh. They have cool touch screen soda machines where you can add different flavors to any soda. My only complaint it the prices. It is a little pricy but worth it in my opinion
2,An ok but Really Small casino with limited number of Slot Machines. Ok selections of Slots but very very limited quantity of each. \n\nNo food court.\n\nNo Starbucks.\n\nLooong walk to Buffet!\n\nLooong walk to Valet pickup!\n\nValet pickup was on the opposite side of the building!\nAnd have to walk outside?\n\nI didn't see a shortcut from within casino.\n\nWhy not chop a shortcut hole/hallway from the casino instead of making you walk way around to the back of the Building? \nOr have valet pickup in front next to drop off like everywhere else?\n\n What an inconvenient casino!\n\nNot anxious to go back unless I have to meet someone there.
0,"I hated this place because professors would make us go here to get course packets.  Why do I need to pay for them, why can't you just provide it to me for free when you're getting the damn syllabus printed!  It was especially the worst when you wait in line for 20 minutes just to get a 20 pg packet."
4,"This my favorite pub in Phoenix! Good beer selections. Good food (the shepard's pie is amaze-balls, the Irish nachos are epic, and the frickles are delish). They have good live music / entertainment during the evenings. This is a great place to go during the day to hang out with friends, watch a game, have a quiet beer, or have an awesome night out partying. The weekend nights are a raging blast! The staff does a great job handling it all!"
3,"I recently switched health insurance companies to coverage under Health Plan of Nevada HMO plan which pretty much limits me to Southwest Medical Associates (SMA) clinics.  Hearing horror stories about the care received at the clinics around town about poor beside manner and long wait times, I was very apprehensive about my visit to Next Door Health.  I got there about 10 minutes before my appointment time and a medical assistant was out to greet me in about 5 minutes?  She was efficient and seemed to know what to do to get me prepped for the PA.\n\nIn comes my PA Kim.  She was all smiles, warm and friendly - definitely not at all what I was expecting from SMA.  We discussed my problem and the most refreshing part was she educated me about what to expect with my treatment.  Usually at a doctor's visit, I get some medications written up and pretty much get thrown out the door after I have waited an hour+.\n\nConclusion:  Great experience.  Will definitely come back for any future medical visits AND I'll be seeing Kim.  p.s.  They do physicals there, too."
2,"The location takes the cake for this Lettuce Entertain You restaurant on the strip.  I would highly recommend a reservation; the downside is you can't get a reservation for the patio - the best patio on the Strip - so that's a long wait if you're wanting to do that.\n\n$260 got the four of us two mid-range bottles of red wine, one salad, four entrees, and one dessert.  I didn't think it was ridiculously overpriced, it's just I would rather eat someplace else.\n\nThe atmosphere was kind of cheesey & touristy, and it was extremely dark in there.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I could barely read the menu.  The first bottle of wine we got was just straight up rancid; once we asked about it, they were quick to replace it.  The French bread and garlic butter was really good to start out with.\n\nI had sea bass, it was just OK.  I think the concensus from the table was everything was just OK.  Maybe I expected more?\n\nOh, except the bread pudding.  The white chocolate bread pudding was amazing."
3,I have only had their Mac 'n Cheese and Shepards Pie...both were AMAZING! I would go back for those two dishes!
0,"While my issue was resolved it was not thanks to the store - which should of been more helpful than they were - read on if you want to know about poor customer service.\n\nYes, in retail you have to expect the store will up-sale - that is usually a retail tactic in most specialty stores - since the traffic is not the same as say a utilitarian product.  But when I the customer walked in there specifically asking for one tea - with a strong cinnamon flavor - AND NO SUGAR, I expect to walk out with at least that.  Now, I repeated myself multiple times - and I was assured that the two teas I was buying (to make one) was sugar free. I knew I was being up-sold and that is my own fault for not sticking to my guns.  But when I went home and tried the tea - it was super sweet (since I have a sugar dietary restriction). IT HAD SUGAR!  Since the store was not open yet - I called corporate and informed them I did not have my receipt.  They informed me since it was this past Sunday - that the store could look it up and they have a 90 day return policy.  I called the store when they opened and gave them the heads up that corporate recommended.  When I get to the store the clerk informed me NO they can't look up the receipt and I can't just return it only exchange it.  I demanded she call corporate to straighten the mess out - she called her manager and when offered the manager to talk to me they did not.  Then she proceeded to tell me that I could call that number.  I said fine please call customer service then - she said no she cannot. I had thought I didn't have my cell phone - when I asked her may I borrow her phone to call her company customer service - she said she wasn't allowed.  So, I was leaving hot explaining to her this is the 2nd wasted trip and I am beyond mad.  On my way to the car I found my cell,  marched in there,  and called corporate customer service in front of her and explained that I was mad and why I was mad - this is lousy customer service and I demand a refund - or I will dispute the charge. This person at corporate was nicer and did help tremendously - he had corporate call the store and then they tried to give me a gift card -  Again I reiterated NO - I want a refund : A) I have wasted my time with a salesperson who does not now their product  B) The store itself was not willing to call their own corporate or let me on their own phone to do so - no way will I take that I want nothing to do with them.  Then corporate had told her to call the regional manager - at which time she only explained the mistake of the actual sales and did not explain the they did not call corporate or would not on my behalf.  I did get my refund -  which they figured more than they charged me - at which point I had them make it close to the amount.  All Retail Sales Associates Should know this:  A) know your product  B) put yourself in the customers shoes and exercise good judgment when you admit a mistake was already on you - service your customer - do not let it get to this point. You're a specialty store - customer service and listening to the customer can make or break you.   1 bad experience is told over and over and so is the case with this story - I did not need this aggravation."
2,"While typical of any airport eatery, the prices are high; $7+ for a bowl of soup, but they do offer employees 20% off. I had an order of fried zuchini, which was pretty good. For $5.50 it was a decent serving size and was garnished with parm cheese. Now, who can go wrong with a bit of parm cheese?!\n\nTheir fries are super thin, they call them shoestring, but they are not quite that thin. I like my fries thick, so I'm not a fan of the fries. Maybe I'd like them better smothered with chili and cheese, tho ($8).\n\nI really appreciate that they were open later than other places."
0,"We had a Groupon to Alize, and wanted to check out what was recommended to us by a couple tourists at the Wynn.\n\nWe arrived for an early dinner, around 6PM, as we had a show in the Palms that night at 8.  It was slow at Alize, so we were really able to relax and enjoy the views.\n\nThe presentation here is superb.  The wait staff is knowledgeable, the wine list is excellent (though very expensive, with very few mid-level options), and the appetizers were delicious - we tried the veal cheek.\n\nThe issue here was the main courses.  They simply weren't very good.  We both ordered our steaks (one rib-eye and one filet mignon) medium rare, and one came out rare (rib-eye) and one came out beyond well-done.  Even at rare, the meat was tough somehow.  \n\nThe sides were very good, but small.  The potatoes with the filet were fried bits of dough - no taste outside of oils and minimal starch.\n\nNeedless to say, we didn't stick around for dessert after being underwhelmed with the main courses.\n\nIf you're looking for a view, check it out for a drink - I just don't recommend staying for the food.  So many options in Las Vegas that dominate this performance."
2,"The place is much too loud for my taste.  Not that the music isn't good, it just gets in the way of good conversation.  If you live close by, get take out.  The pizza will still be good (the potato is by far the best) although the crust has gotten doughier than I like.  They are the perfect location though when you've had a few beers at the Main."
2,Shay did a good job on my pre natel massage. I didn't realize this at the time but she put a lot of lotion on me that I had to take two showers to take it off and I still feel like I have it on.
1,"This is NOT the same as the Boston name. I have dinned at the Beacon Hill one for years when I lived on the east coast. The epic eggplant parmesan and prosciutto were noticeably missing, as was the legendary fociacia. This place is average north east thin crust pizza with sweet sauce and should not be mistaken for Boston's legendary upper crust, no matter what it's origin."
2,"I like the convenient location of Creative Nails & Tan since I'm always in the area.  The service here is pretty quick and I've never had to wait to be seated.  Their prices are about average.  You can get a mani/pedi for $30 which seems reasonable to me.  They have around 8 pedi chairs and just a few manicure tables.  Their facility seems very clean.  The language barrier kind of prevents the full royal treatment but they're always friendly and accomodating.\n\nI stopped in on Friday for a pedicure.  As soon as I walked in they got my chair ready and sat me down.  The lady who did my toes did a good job and they looked great when she was finished.  We messed up my big toe a little when we were putting on my flip flops but she repaired it right away and it looked good as new.  \n\nWhile this might not be my top recommendation for a girls day spa treatment, it's definitely a decent place to go if you need a quick spruce up."
4,Couldn't be better. Enough said!
2,This is a fine brew pub. I wouldn't really actively seek it out for its food or beer but I think both are decent. If you play ultimate frisbee in Madison you find yourself in these establishments a bit too often.
3,"My boyfriend and I came here this past Wednesday for a real breakfast not on the strip. We love a good breakfast that is filling; Mr Mama's did the trick! \n\nThe wait staff was friendly and attentive; the manager/ owner was there, having a sincere conversation with every single patron. Having worked in a mom&pop cafe before, I appreciated that the boss was just a genuine dude, unlike the doofuses I used to work for. The gratitude, kindness, and personality of the restaurant and its staff is just awesome. I just wish we had quality places like this back home! The attitude here spoke volumes about the business.\nThanks Mr Mama's for filling us up with a yummy home-style breakfast!! KCCO"
0,"Ew, this place is disgusting. We stayed in the fantasy suite building in the \""pool suite\""-but it would have been more aptly named 'nightmare suite.' Old, dirty, broken... And way overpriced. You couldn't pay me to stay here again.\n\nThe whole place feels old, dirty, cheap and trashy. I think you get the point. AVOID!"
2,"Opa! I normally don't care for Greek food because I don't like lamb so frequently used in their dishes but this place offers plenty of tasty alternatives. My wife likes Greek and I  agreed to look at the menu online. They had lots of variety including steak, chops, chicken parm, pizza and calzones -- all with a Mediterranean flare.\n\nThe atmosphere is a cross between traditional and modern. Little hand painted wooden tables and blue cloth napkins with clean, open styling.\n\nWe went on a Sunday for dinner and it was about 1/3 full.\n\nWe were taken care of promptly. After mulling over the alternatives, i felt brave enough to go Greek. I ordered the Angus Steak Souvlaki dinner and my better half had the same only with grilled shrimp. We got a couple of soft drinks in cups so large you won't need a refill.\n\nIt wasn't long before we were served. Both plates looked great. Nice presentation. My steak was tender and juicy and my wife's shrimp were grilled to perfection. Other sides included potatoes, rice, veggies and pita triangles. (Maybe too much on the starches guys.). I recommend the Greek salad as a starter to add to the green balance.\n\nOur server was attentive and very friendly. \n\nOverall nice experience. We will be back."
1,"Inside the LVH hotel, where the BF and I decided to grab a bite to eat before the D word musical, it's location is nearby Benihana's and a couple of other restaurants overlooking a waterfall and pond, with a marquee display of fireworks (every hour?)\n\nVery romantic, however the food was lackluster in flavor. Service was top notch and it did get pretty busy as the night wore on."
3,"I love there street tacos! There super cheep and delicious. The quesadilla with white cheese and beans is amazing, fills all my cravings. You get free chips and salsa but the extra dollar or two for the bean dip is worth it."
3,Underated and ignored!  if you see this ol time pizzaria near Kennywood stop on by good crust nice and buttery in the sicilian style!  Better then DiSallas  the only thing I can say that is better then Latinas is Mineo's !  they say the best pizzarias are the little holes in the wall type places and this is one of those enviroments!  Small and cozy very nice and relaxing afternoon!  To just enjoy with yourself and a friend!
0,"Disgusting. Smelled like sewer backed up, soy sauce container felt glued to counter ewwww.never had warm sushi before. Didn't know Philly roll served room temp.plus happy hour prices non existent.waiter didn't give 50%dis pocketed the $ instead. Calling corporate first thing in morning.Opened yelp account to post this. That's how bad this place is. If u wanna catch food poisoning go eat there."
0,"I booked the hotel through their website.  \n\nIt was nice, I liked the room. Everything was A-ok other than there was no fridge. \n\nThat was until I saw my bill. The price of the room did not include several hidden fee's such as a hotel fee and resort fee per day which adds up to quite a lot of a few days.\n\nNext time i will stay at the hyatt across the street.  NO HIDDEN FEES THERE!"
0,oh my lord I didn't realize I didn't slam this place but I should of because I thought la pinks was slipping but this place gave me the runs and throwing up all through the night. It literally ruined my vacation there.
0,I have been to a lot of bead stores and this one is not good.  The prices are way too high and the service is awful. Go spend your money somewhere else.   Do not shop here.
0,"Sorry, SushiSamba, but what happens in Vegas, certainly does not stay in Vegas.\n\nI was recently on a business trip to the Sin City and ate at SushiSamba three separate occasions. The first two were great experiences, but sadly third time wasn't a charm. It completely ruined my entire experience.\n\nWhile the sushi was good (certainly not the best I've ever had) I was appalled when my co-worker found a hair in his roll during my third meal there. As soon as he did, we notified our waitress and her reply was \""can I get you another roll?\"" so he ordered a new one. Then she asks, \""is it blonde? Because if it is, it may have been mine but don't worry I showered this morning.\""\n\nYelpers, I kid you not.\n\nOH GEE THANKS! Now I can rest assured knowing your dead skin cells that are possibly floating around my stomach were at least CLEAN.\n\nI about died - but instead stuck to eating coconut rice (I didn't dare touch a roll). A few minutes later..... another hair.\n\nThis time I stormed up and demanded the manager who questioned us the entire time and seemed entirely unconvinced that there was any hair in either of the rolls. I am sorry, but when a customer is SHOWING YOU a hair in their food, you should probably not question it. She then says, \""I just have to check because sometimes it isn't hair. Sometimes it is just small shards of chopsticks that look like blonde hair.\""\n\nAre you kidding me? So now, I should be happy with the fact that it might not be the waitress' CLEAN blonde hair, but instead a shard of chopstick that could pierce my esophagus?\n\nI have never experienced a more ridiculous restaurant situation in my life. Needless to say I left with the worst impression of the entire restaurant, which is a pity considering the first two occasions went well. Good luck to whoever dines at this place - but don't worry, at least the hair in your sushi roll is probably clean."
4,"Ive been coming here for years. I have tried every single place in the valley. Although some are good, there are just too many dishes that are great here. Love the spicy noodle, went on that binge for a while. I have tried the Panang everywhere else and it doesnt compare to siames cat. I dont really care about the decor or the location. If you want decor go to scottsdale. It's not a good location for business though, right off the freeway, so it's mostly know by locals."
3,"One of the best places on the strip for a 24/7 cafe. I have always frequented this place because their selection of food at ridiculous hours is pretty good. You have your burgers, breakfast, the classic BLT, desserts and cocktails. Everyone comes here after their clubbing or gambling. This one is located in the Venetian and is spacious and the people who work the graveyard shift are peppy and upbeat.\n\nWe had a breakfast sandwich that was delicious and was recommended by our server. I only ate half of it and saved it for later. The servers are awesome, or at least the one we had, was cool. THe ambience is like a Cheesecake factory.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place, go check it out."
2,"Happy hour is great if you can fight your way over to a seat at the bar. Otherwise, this place ain't that special."
1,"I have never felt the urge to write a review before, but I've noticed that Eat has more positive reviews than it deserves, while most of the negative reviews are buried in the \""not recommended\"" section although they paint pictures similar to my experience.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, but the service and food are mediocre at best. My party of 3 arrived and were met with a line where no one had been asked for names or the number of people in their party yet. The hostess milled around and offered no explanation. We waited 30 minutes even though there were several empty tables. Again, the hostess offered no explanation. A party of two who came in after three other parties of two-three people was seated prior to us because they asked to sit at the counter (which was never offered as an option to the parties who arrived before). Once the food came, the hostess approached and asked if we needed boxes for our food before we'd taken a collective five bites. We waited about thirty minutes for our check after asking two different people: this was weird because they obviously needed the table..."
1,"Want so bad to give this place a good review but I can't because if awful service. I agree about the good beer selection and food, but these people are so desperate to leave early that the waitress had to inform us 3 times that the kitchen closes in 20 mins. This all before saying hello."
3,"I've now had 2 dinners here and I much prefer eating here than having dinner on the strip.\n\nThe food is delicious and there is also a great wine selection! I've never been to a thai restaurant that takes wine pairing so seriously, it's awesome.\n\nMy most favorite dish is the braised short rib Khao Soi. Braised short ribs on top of egg noodles with the most delicious coconut curry ever. You definitely need some sticky rice to dip in the sauce as well. So good!\n\nI also really liked the garlic prawns. Very fried so I recommend sharing this dish with a big group. 1 is enough.\n\nNam Kao Tod (crispy rice salad) is a great starter. Everyone seems to order this and it's definitely for a reason.\n\nNo reservations are taken over the summer so get here early! We arrived with a group of 8 at about 5:10 on Saturday and were 2nd in line. By the time they opened at 5:30 there was a giant line. By 7:30 when we left there were TONS of people waiting.."
2,"They do make good coffee, decent smoothies and crappy hot chocolate. I tried hot chocolate at least 3-4 times, and it is one of the worst I ever had. To be frank, I prefer Starbucks smoothie, hot chocolate over 61c any day. \n\nI do visit this coffee shop because of the environment. Most of the people here are trying to get their work done and environment motivates me to get my work done too. I also like outdoor seating when it is warm."
3,I had my reservations about the Playboy Club since I don't really envision Playboy as the classiest company possible but I was proven wrong. The atmosphere was really quite fun and even I did not find the women in bunny costumes as annoying as I thought I would. Although the dance floor is pretty small it was packed and there were also a number of places to sit as well.
2,Staff friendly and attentive.  Salsa was very watery .  I couldn't find any evidence that it was made from tomatoes except that it was red.  Both of our entrees were flavorful.  We will go back.
2,"It's was ok at best, it started when we entered the restaurant there was no friendly hello it almost seemed like we were unexpected. When it came to restaurant it was clean and about half full server was great, attentive and met our needs really well. Food was mediocre found a bit over cooked even found a chicken bone in the chicken lettuce wraps. Overall it was average, I have been to PF changs in Spokane and Las Vegas and the were both superior by far."
4,I treat myself to this every once in a while as an indulgence.  Food is fabulous. Best Philly Cheese steak in Arizona.  Always fresh ingredients and they ship in specialty items in from Pennsylvania.
2,"For some reason the pretzels here are not as good as the ones at other malls I've been to. Also since this location is in a busy outlet mall, there is always a line and sometimes the line is out the door. They have a pretzel stand location near parking garage B that has limited options but does not have a line. I would recommend going there if you just want a pretzel or lemonade and don't require a full menu of items"
3,"Let me start off by saying my husband and I absolutely love this place. In fact it is one of our most favorite spots in phoenix. The happy hour here is phenomenal. Love the cheese dip, shrimp scampi and the chile rellenos. Definitely authentic mouth watering New Mexican cuisine. So why am I giving this four stars? Only because it is such a small restaurant and most of the time the back room is being rented out by private parties. Also definitely not a kid friendly place which is a total bummer for us because we have a newborn and no babysitter to leave our little one behind with which means no more dicks hideaway :(...however this will be our first stop when we get a night out."
4,"This is our 1st time at any of the Mastro's restaurants.  We have family & friends in the Vegas area who recommended & accompanied this as a truly upscale & 4-to-5 star dining experience.  They were correct!  \n\nUpon being seated practically in the center of their 60 ft teak or mahogany simulated Treehouse, we asked the very crisply uniformed Captain to recommend the appetizers.  He had us create our own \""Seafood Tower\"" and we chose crab claws, shrimp, oysters & calamari... delish!  The Lobster Bisque, Clam Chowder & Iceberg Wedge were next.  The five of us then shared a Filet, Chilean Sea Bass, Atlantic Salmon & Scallops with Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  Our Captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.\n\nNow.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the Mastro's Butter Cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.  \n\nNeedless to say & in keeping with my \""positively outrageously\"" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy Mastro's if you're in Vegas!"
4,I have been going to Delightful Nails for several months.   Karen is fantastic-friendly and meticulous. I have tried quite a few nail salons in this area and Delightful Nails is by far the best .
0,"I was in town for business and got back to my hotel around 7PM (dinner time). Having work to do for my client, I decided that I would order food to be delivered to my room and chinese food sounded great! \n\nI ordered General Tso's Chicken, a small Pork Lo Mein, and the fried dumplings. I thought I was in for a treat as I don't often get the chance to have chinese food. Little did I know, that the food about to be delivered from Taste of China @ 5415B Monona Dr, Monona, WI was horrible.\n\nThe chicken smelled a little different, but when i tasted it I could tell that it had been left out on the counter for hours instead of being in a cooler prior to preparation. The pork lo mein was OK, so I ate some of it and the dumplings were edible.\n\nThe next day, I was sick all day. I called the resteraunt and complained when I got back to the hotel and they offered to replace my order. No way was I going to go for round two of the food poisoning game. Instead I told them that I would be posting this review and reporting them to the health department. DO NOT EAT THERE!! YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY THAT YOU DID!!"
2,Parking is horrendous. Here they are sitting on countless acres of empty desert scrub land and some genius has devised a parking lot so needlessly complex it is a maze of one-way streets.  Ridiculous considering there is nothing but the casino for miles in any direction.  WTF?
0,"We transferred to CenturyLink from COX because we thought we were getting a better price. NOT! They ask me how many devices. We had in my home so they can get me the right modem.  Well they gave us a 15mbps modem. We were told that should work. Well after a week or two we called back to let them know of the problems we were having with the 15mbps. So the customer rep. Sent us a 20mbps modem. DID NOT WORK for all of our devices and we also found out that ON DEMAND also uses up bandwidth.  THEY FORGOT TO MENTION THAT.. So when we asked about the 40mbps WE FOUND OUT IT'S NOT IN OUR AREA.  REALLY? By this time we received our second bill and it was freaking high. So we called a again to asked them why our bill was so high. The nice customer service rep. Found out they charged us $99 for our second modem that we were leasing like the first one.  so he adjusted the bill. Now we get our third bill it to was very high. So we call again come to find out all of this time DIRECTV was not on the bill. Well, DIRECTV charged for the two months they missed or should I say CenturyLink left off.  so now I'm Pissed because we are now paying almost three hundred by this time for some messed up telephone and Internet service. I actually love my directv so that's a keeper. But CenturyLink has to go...so needless to say I went back to COX for Internet only but at least I know now all of my devices are working. Oh yeah we couldn't get the Verizon discount because we were already on a discount plan with Verizon. ...so stick a fork in me WE ARE DONE...."
3,"Of the Fox restaurants, I think this is one of my favorites.  Lots of fresh seasonal ingrediants and sea food.  the interior is beautifully decorated, regardless if you eat at a table or at the bar, you will get the same attentive service.  A must try if you are in North Scottsdale."
3,"this happens to be one of those places that is always referenced in a typical \""do you remember the time in vegas when...\"" story.  \n\nno really.  \n\nfun music.  fun bartenders.  typically fun people.  \n\nhad to 86 some guy who heard a friend of mine say \""no thanks, i have a boyfriend\"" and interpreted that as \""please dance ridiculously around me in circles and rub up against me.\""  but hey...that's what friends are for, right?  \n\nwell anyways, never ordered a ridiculously large beverage...just the normal beers and mixed drinks.  it gets a little hectic while waiting for your drinks - but they throw things and give you free shots so you tend to forget that you were there for a while..."
2,"After arriving in Las Vegas my friends and I decided to head over to Sherwood Forest Caf\u00e9 fr breakfast.  The best way to Sherwood Forest Caf\u00e9 is that it's a Las Vegas Denny's.  It's your basic American Style Dinner that serves Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.  The menu here won't blow you away, but there is something for everyone.  \n\nMost of the breakfast items here are under $15 unless you go for the steak and eggs combo.  You're looking at your \""typical\"" Denny's breakfast menu filled with pancakes, waffles, scrambles, and omelets.  So if you're looking for something more, this isn't the place for you.\n\nI put in for an order of the egg beater scrambled with wheat toasts, ham, and orange juice and my friends also put in an order for 2 egg scramble and eggs benedicts.  We chatted for a while and out came my juice.  It wasn't freshly squeezed juice, but a lot better than most places where they have it tapped into their fountain drinks.\n\nWhen our breakfast arrived, portion size was decent.  The egg beaters were ok, I asked for some salsa and that help with it.  I got a good amount of hash browns which were good but nothing special.  Probably the best part was the ham.  It was a nice thick cut piece of ham that you see people get at a buffet (which probably happened considering we are in Vegas).  None the less it was pretty good.  My friends seem to enjoy their breakfast, not making either negative or positive comments about it.\n\nTo pay, once you get your bill from the waitress, you have to leave your table and pay up front where you came in.  So that's an FYI so you don't sit around forever waiting for the waitress to pick it up.  The service here was ok, kind of equal to what you expect for in Denny's type place.  They were there and that's about it.\n\nAs to rating, best way to describe Sherwood Forest Caf\u00e9 is that it fulfills a need.  It doesn't pretend to do more than that, it's just there for people to get something to eat.  If you go in with that kind of expectations, you should do fine.  And since Sherwood Forest Caf\u00e9 filled my need of having breakfast, it gets a 3 star rating."
1,I just ordered some wor won ton soup and egg rolls. How disappointing! The won tons had very little meat and they had a really dough-y texture. I'm not used to that at all and didn't care for it one bit. The prices weren't bad but I just wasn't impressed with the food. Maybe I should have went to Jacky Chan down the street..
4,Mmmm... First time here. Foods amazing!!! cant wait to go back!!
1,"I ordered the Hot Box Special, with a Spinner 'Zone (spinach calzone), fries, and a can of Cherry Coke. The total came to $9 with tax.\n\nI got a lot more food than I expected, but with less flavor than I would have liked. I was stuffed after eating 2/3 of the calzone, half of the fries, and all of the sauce. There was only a smidgen of spinach (mostly cheese and dough), and since I like tomato sauce, not enough of it. The soda was a splurge since I don't drink it often, but it's really not necessary.\n\nI would recommend saving a few dollars by not getting the combo, and instead getting just a calzone and an extra container of sauce for $0.60. That would put it on par with about 3 slices of decent pan style cheese pizza folded up. Think twice about paying more for toppings, because they were inconsequential in my order.\n\nBottom line: I'm not planning on ever going back, but I don't feel sick or cheated, either."
0,I would have to say the worst restaurant I've been to in Vegas. I had the short rib ravioli and that's one of my favorite dishes from other restaurants. Their version of it tasted like pasta you'd get from a buffet. The steak is Denny's steak quality along with the sauce that went over it. Lobster didn't taste like fresh lobster. More like frozen lobster! We ordered a bottle of moscato and one of the busboys threw it away before we even finished the whole bottle. Who does that? I was expecting a lot more from the this restaurant due to the reviews on yelp. There are thousands of better restaurants in Vegas. Please skip this one!!!!
1,"I'm a fan of Fry's grocery stores. This location has been here a while but the inside is kept up pretty well. When I'm on this side of town and I need some groceries, well you can bet this is the place I'm going to go to. Normally I would give Fry's a better review but I need to emphasize the disappointment I have in their fuel station. I was so excited to see that Fry's had bought out the local gas station on the corner of the same property they are in. It's cool because it's connected with a McDonald's so it's almost too convenient at times. Nothings better than buying gift cards for every day use and receiving 2x-4x times the fuel rewards points for discounts on gas-Bonus!!!! Unfortunately, this Fry's has decided to put their very brightest & best employee in charge of it all. Now I'm laying my sarcasm on pretty thick so hopefully you can muscle thru it as I complete my review......\n\nI've ran into this gem of an employee before but her performance today was priceless. Somethings wrong with the gas pumps and people are potentially losing field points because of the issue. For some reason it's always the not so super awesome individuals that this happens to because they are always the ones that act completely irrational like the world is coming to an end. I find myself standing at the counter trying to purchase a couple drinks while I have to not so polite customers speaking over me to get the employees attention. Mind you, entering the store as well as making my way up to the counter I received no salutations. As I'm standing there trying to purchase some beverages to quench my thirst, the employee turns away and makes a phone call to whomever to alert them of the problem. Stands there for about a minute checking her phone then leaves me and a couple customers in the lobby while she goes to the back of the store and is gone from site. Thank goodness I'm honest and these other customers are enraged enough that they want some type of retribution or else we could have looted the store like the lyrics of sublimes 1992 riot song. Just saying-it could happen. After a couple minutes the employee came out and decided she could ring me up. I don't know why I stayed so long maybe because of boredom or the fact that I thought one of the customers would loose their cool & I wanted front row visibility, who knows.... Hopefully somebody important in the Fry's food chain will see this review & take the time to evaluate & determine if this employee is well suited for this particular position. Bon Chance."
3,"If this place was closer to me, I'd go more often. I love their patio, location (DC Ranch is niiiccceee) wine selection, happy hour, and appetizers. If you're a single man and/or the scandalous, committed type, definitely go here for their Ladies Night on Thursdays. This place reeks of Chanel, Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs, etc...you get my drift (haha). Being a straight woman, I've picked up women here and have been picked up by women here without even trying. Just try not to trip and fall on all the dropped panties on the floor.\n\nI usually order a glass of the 2006 Duckhorn \""Decoy\"", Napa Cabernet and warm spinach dip (the best I've ever had) to pair it with.  Dee-licious. Their wine flight menu is great, too if you want to reach out of your comfort zone and try something new. I give this place 4 stars because I haven't tried much of their food, but I'm sure it's good and it tends to be super busy every time I stop by, which slows the service. If you do decide to go here, be prepared to be around a lot of people (typical Scottsdale crowd). I haven't had the luck to be here on a slow night. \n\nAnd for the Trouts that prey on young women like me, try and tell me something I don't already know. \""I own this company....drive this car....yada...yada...yada...\"""
3,"While Blue Man Group is not exactly my type of show (I gravitate more to Cirque or dance based performances), I could definitely appreciate it and had a good time. \n\nNote: Picking up tickets is a bit difficult- if possible, I'd pick them up hours before the show starts. We arrived at 9:15 and there was a long line at will-call. \n\nAs far as the show itself  goes, there is lots of audience interaction from the outset- -before the show actually starts, they get the audience yelling out things-  and a few bits where they pull \""random\"" (maybe planted) members of the audience out of the crowd and onto stage with them.   It is definitely loud- lots of banging, loud musical numbers, and a little strange and messy, but that's the point of it.  If you're sitting in the \""splatter zone\"", you'll be given ponchos to cover your clothes. That's a good idea! \n\n I was impressed by how the Blue Men,  the props, or the music could make things funny without saying a word. It is appropriate for all ages, and I found that I actually learned a thing or two.  Some acts require reading things either projected on/above the stage, or held on cards by the Blue Men themselves.  Luckily, the theatre is pretty small so you're able to see things clearly, and I don't think there is truly a \""bad seat\"" in the house.\n\nThere were several people who'd seen the show multiple times, and while I enjoyed it, I'm not sure if it is a show that I'd see over and over again. \n\nSome of the acts lag a little bit, and I did find myself getting weary a time or two, but that may just be because we went to the 10pm show.  Overall, though, I found myself with a smile on my face, chuckling, giggling, or oohing for the majority of the time. The ending was definitely a fun experience, although your hair might get a little messed up!"
1,"Let me start by saying that the hotel itself is pretty cool and its awesome that it is in a mall so there are tons of stores nearby for convenience! The rooms are okay, nothing super fancy, but there is no fridge, which sucked in vegas!! But what really made the stay at this hotel horrible was the manager...and a few of the staff members. The manager could give a shit less about her PAYING customers and treated me absolutely horribly. Her staff weren't much better and weren't exactly jumping up and down to assist me. I lost my wallet in our first room (before we upgraded to a better view room) and no one at the front desk/concierge desk were helpful when trying to help me get a hold of someone in security, who always seemed to be missing! Finally, I got a hold of someone and they were able to find the wallet, but the security people were rude as well. I do have to say that I am thankful to the housekeepers who found my wallet and were gracious enough to turn it in. They were all very friendly passing by in the hallway. \n\nThis was my birthday trip and I did a lot of research before choosing a hotel because I wanted it to be a great experience for a decent price and I feel like I made a mistake staying here because of the horrible customer service. Where I come from, typically the customer is always right, and even when the customer is wrong, still treat them with respect and kindness because they are paying to stay at your hotel, when there are TONS of other places to choose from on the strip. I will not be staying here again!"
1,"The food and service is SO not worth the price!\n\nThere was a line when we went, and that moved quickly, which was nice.  That was the last upside to our visit.  After we were seated, it took 10 minutes for anybody to come by with water.  And then it took another 10 minutes for our surly waitress to ask us if we wanted anything.  Ummm, yes, that's sort of why we're here, right??\n\nSo among three of us, we ordered french toast and a breakfast burrito.  The breakfast burrito was just ok, and the $12 french toast came with a slice and a half of bread.\n\nSo after 75 minute breakfast that should have been around a half an hour, our wallets were FORTY FIVE dollars lighter and we were still hungry.  Don't bother with this joint!!"
4,Mesa Grill is one of my favorite restaurants.  Good location in Caesars and nice decor.  The tables can be close together though.  I've dined here several times over the past few years.  The scallops and pumpkin soup (when available) are outstanding appetizers.  The coffee rubbed filet and the pork tenderloin are fantastic main courses.  You can't go wrong with the sticky toffee for dessert!
0,"One Hour and Twenty Minutes!!\n\nThat is how long we stood in line waiting to check in and pick up our car on Saturday, February 22, 2014!!\n\nI had reserved this car on November 15th to be picked up at 11:30am on February 22, 2014. At approximately 11:00am we arrived and saw about 12 people in line.  \""This shouldn't take long.\""   There was ONE agent working on our line.  Behind the same counter were FOUR agents working on the DOLLAR rental line.  Needless to say, their line moved much quicker.\n\nI feel very strongly that the one agent was doing his best. At about 1 hour another agent joined the counter so now we had two agents. The agent that helped us, finally, was very nice, professional, and apologetic for the long delay. \n\nI am appalled by the amount of time it took to assist 12 people - 80 minutes divided by 12 customers = over 6 minutes each. If that is a typical time frame - then my suggestion would be to staff the counter based on the reservations.\n\nTRUST ME - if I hadn't thought I had prepaid my $70+ bill - I would have left and gone to another rental car company. \n\n\nI am disappointed, angry, and appalled at the level of service given to us by Thrifty Rental Car."
1,"I booked Le Westin given the great reviews, I'm a gold SPG member and it had a great location. I booked three nights with a discounted prepaid rate. However, due to weather challenges in Chicago (12 hours at the airport on a Thursday and an offer to not get to Montreal until later on Friday) I ended up cancelling the trip. I did both call SPG and the hotel directly alerting them of the issue and they deferred me to the hotel's \""billing group\"" and promised they would email the team of my problems. I didn't expect they would refund all three nights but I was asking for a reasonable accommodation. Since I didn't have a call by Monday I called SPG directly and they told me they could not assist and, once again, had me call the hotel. When I did speak with a hotel representative they told me that the \""billing group\"" had nothing to do with the decision and took my information for a manager to contact me. Well, I did see one attempted call from the hotel with no message. I haven't attempted to call back as I assume their position is they have no interest in my issue or care about my business.\n\nOn a positive note, I did work with their concierge prior to the trip on arranged transportation to the hotel. Given the evolving departure times I was in regular email contact with the concierge team and they were incredibly helpful in keeping the car service aware of the issue. When the plane was cancelled they immediately contacted me and wanted to confirm my plans. Once I connected with them they were sympathetic to my travel challenges and ensured that I was not responsible to may for the car service since I was proactively communicating with them. I did let them know that they had earned my business purely through email - I just wish the hotel's management had a similar concept of hospitality."
1,"We stopped here before heading out to Phoenix, Arizona on a Wednesday afternoon. When paying the cashier was having a problem using my debit card, how much trouble I found out the next day. The food was good, but they charged my card twice to the tune of $30.31. Not that its a tremendous amount of money but it has now been 6 weeks and they have yet to credit me back. I merely warn people to pay cash or have your money held hostage."
1,"It was late...we were hungry...it was close...it was uninspiring.\n\nThere was a hint of fishy smell which should have been a warning, but again - we were hungry!  \n\nWe sat down, excited for some sushi.  I ordered some seared tuna to start - I thought it should be like I am used to; melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness.  It could not have been further from that.  The tuna was dry and almost chewy!\n\nA couple of the other rolls we had were okay, but nothing to gush about.  \n\nI felt this was very overpriced.  We will not be back."
0,"yuck.  I love eating.  I love food.  Not finishing my plate is a rare event.  My red curry was almost all cheap, hardly cooked onions.  The sauce did not taste like curry, and they had Chinese zodiac menus on the table.  I can accept many flaws, but there was not a single redeemable quality here."
0,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. Since I suffer from back problems I decided to bite the bullet and buy either a Sleep Number or a Tempur-Pedic. Well Sleep Number lost out because of one of the worst sales rep I have ever met. Once inside the store I looked around and waited for my daughter (who was parking her car) to help me in my decision. In the store there were two sales rep, neither greets me, which I can overlook since the store in located inside a busy mall and they might receive their fair share of window shoppers with no intentions of buying. After a while the blond one, which unfortunately I never caught her name, deigns to greet me and asked if I needed any help, I told her thank you but I'm waiting for my daughter. She responds with a snide tone \""Why? Does she sale mattresses?\"" my reply you might ask? \""Why? Do you need to sale mattresses to buy one?\"" I'm not sure why I got this kind of treatment, but if I'm going to drop over $3000 on a mattress you dam well better believe I need to be treated which some modicum of respect which in this case all I got was disrespect. Overall bad experience, avoid this store at all cost."
1,"Dreadful service and mediocre cream teas. The sign says to seat yourself, so we did. 10 minutes later, a woman popped her head out and saw us. She (the older woman) took our order without saying a single word. I said, \""Two cream teas, please,\"" and she just scooted off without any smile, greeting or acknowledgement of the order at all. Later I asked for some more clotted cream because the jars they give you are quite small in contrast to most other tea rooms. She did not inform me that there was extra charge for that. I wouldn't have minded paying for it, but certainly you should at least tell the customer that you charge extra. The scones didn't taste freshly baked and were just so-so. The jam was just out of a jar and so-so. On the good side, the place is pretty cheap. \u00a33.65 for a cream tea. I'd recommend spending a little more and going to a nicer place.\n\nAlso, this tea room does not take debit or credit cards, only cash."
1,"UPDATE-\n\nMy colleague wrote a long, truthful review for this restaurant. It was negative in context, so the owner complained to Yelp and had it removed. I am downgrading my review from a 3 to a 2, which is what his was. Be careful who you listen to here, the negative ones magically disappear.\n\n\n\n\nOn to my review...\n\n\nFEZ is one of my favorite restaurants... For the food. The service is extremely hit or miss! I've been to this particular spot at least a dozen times because I love their brunch. My girlfriends always come with me because FEZ has the most fantastic drinks ever! We have found that sitting at the bar is best if you want to be treated like a lady. \n\nThis review would be five stars if it weren't for the poor quality of people on the floor. I tried to email the owner at FEZ from their web site to stress my concern, as I spend somewhere around $600 a year here but I have received no response. I don't believe we'll be going back anymore, and it breaks my heart. I loved you FEZ, but I'll be going somewhere that my money is better appreciated :("
3,"Clean Freaks UNITE!  For under $20, you can bring in your car in for unlimited washes.  For the summer months, you know we all need this deal!!  This location can get pretty crazy busy because it's fast and cheap!  For only $3, you can get a basic car wash.  I haven't stayed to clean the inside because these are usually being used however, I will be using them sooner than later.  If you are on a budget , this is a great place to get your car washed quickly and the staff has always been friendly and helpful!"
3,"I have only been here once for a private party, but it was more spacious inside than I was expecting. The bartenders were friendly and made a good drink. The food that was provided for our event (not sure it was from them) was not super great, but passable for a cocktail party. There is an area in the back with two tables and wrap around couches that our group stayed at all night. I would be interested in coming back here on a normal night."
3,Baby back and St Louis sale ribs are awesome. Love the coleslaws and baked potatoes.  Will sure be back next time we are in town!!!\n\nCorn bread is also very very good!!!
2,"I love Banh Mi sandwiches and I was recommended this place which is conveniently located at the corner of Jean-Talon / St-Denis. \n\nOnce you walk in, on your right you pass by a long SUPER SHINY table where patrons can enjoy their food. On your left is an open fridge area where you can pick up your desired drink, dessert and so forth. On the far right there's a deli counter where you can order your food and watch it get prepared for you in front of you. Just make sure to pay attention during the preparation and not share my fate.\n\nI went with their #1 Banh Mi sandwich and overall it was pretty good. For a mere $4 you have this huge beast of a hoagie with the ingredients you want . The bread was perfect, the ingredients were fresh and it would have been a solid 4 star experience... if the person who did my sandwich understood correctly that I did not want my Banh Mi to be spicy. NO SPICY? MO' SPICY? Being someone who's not a fan of spicy and would much rather taste the sandwich for what it is... I felt the spiciness diminished my BANH MI EXPERIENCE! (-1).\n\nAll in all, I may try again... one day."
0,"Dear Justin, spare me. Can you not make a comment if you work for the place? Can you not comment after a whole year? You need to get a life  buddy!!! People who are looking to go there want to know what it's like, hence yelp. I am from Michigan, and was visiting the Phoenix area. I have been all over the United States, so I can guarantee you I can \""be pleased\"". This place is a nightmare period. Not for an adult who isn't filled with silicone or covered in nasty cologne and hair gel."
4,Best service ever !!!! My iPhone looks brand-new and Clinton was awesome!!! customer service was great very nice company recommend them to everyone I'm also getting my iPad mini fixed. reasonable prices my phone was ready in 15 minutes best service ever in Las Vegas definitely definitely go to them for any repair needs!!!!
0,"One of our worse dinning experience in Madison. The basement location could be quaint but is so stuffed with tables and overcrowded that once you are seated, you are jostled and bumped by every passing patron and server. The food is defiantly overpriced for the rudimentary facility and the level of service (minimal and brusque). Sadly, the pasta we ordered was barely passable. \n\nMy wife and I rushed to arrive before the nightly restaurant rush so we could be sure to get a table. There were a few open when we arrive, but they would not seat us because we were waiting on another couple in 15-20min. I explained that we would order appetizers and drinks while we waited, but they would not even take our names until the whole party arrive. The other couple arrived in 15 minute, but by then the place had filled and we ended up waiting more than an hour for a table."
2,"Pros: clean, quiet, front desk friendly. \n\nCons: provider spent less then 2 min. Office is cold, so bring something warm to wear. There was 1 person in front of me and it still took over 45 min to be seen. I can hear people in the rooms surrounding me but no doctor.  She didn't seem knowledgeable about one of the meds I take which is an immune-suppressor. I could tell she was pretending she knew but had no clue and was quick to exit the room."
4,"This show is awesome! Second only to \""O\"" but they are two completely different shows.  It's based on a dream so expect to be a little confused and just go with it.  It's a dream. Strange shit is supposed to happen in it. \n\nIt's visually beautiful and worth the money.  Here's a tip, don't get seats near the front of the stage.  There is so much going on everywhere that you might get a neck ache sitting too close to the stage.  You want to book seats at least in row H or above in order to fully enjoy everything. It's a small venue so you don't really have any \""bad\"" seats. \n\nWords can't really do it justice but I'll try to describe the show. . . If you took all the alien studs from Prometheus, throw in hot high heeled, synchronized swimmers, some salsa dancers and one devil guy and made a semi love story out of it, you would get Le Reve. Kind of. . . maybe? \n\nIt's basically a show with a bunch of hot dudes, beautiful babes, some dancing, some magic, acrobats and a bit of humor. Enjoy."
0,I received a vanilla brownie Sunday instead of chocolate. Second time my order has been screwed up or they have forgotten something.
0,"WOW,  and i mean that in a bad way.\n\nNormally i'd give a restaurant of this caliber 2 stars at least, but seeing how it's from a \""celebrity chef\"" I was tougher with the grading.\n\nSo the first thing you'll notice at this restaurant is that they love chili peppers...there are pictures, carvings, embossed logos of peppers everywhere...the doors, the mirrors, the tables, the roof etc.   Sounds good because i love spicy food.   However, the sad fact is nothing was really spicy at all.\n\nI came here for brunch with a fairly large party and pretty much everyone was not impressed with what they got.     In fact I want to give this place ZERO stars because they did the impossible!  They messed up breakfast food!  I mean eggs? Bacon? Potatoes?!  Those things practically cook themselves!  And they are inherently so delicious I could put them in a bowl and microwave them and they'd be good!\n\nWell,  this place has completely turned me off to anything Bobby Flay."
1,"Not a bad location within the Venetian/Palazzo Hotel, but that's pretty much it. \n\nWasn't a fan of the overpriced food and the OK eating experience. \n\nThere are better locations to dine IMO."
2,"Food was pretty good but atmosphere was a bit stuffy and formal for my taste. The best part of the dinng room is that it overlooks the fountains at Bellagio, so every 15 minutes or so you would get to see the fountain shows. Service started out a bit slow but once we told them we were in a hurry they picked up the pace.\n\nThere was a small group of us so we went family style with a couple of us ordering chef tastings/Pre fixe menu and a couple noodle dishes and a fried rice dish and shared them. Dinner for 5 including gratuity was $530.00, which is by far the most expensive chinese food I have ever eaten but we did have a couple bottles of wine and cocktails."
1,"I am a Thailand return Peace Corps volunteer, which, for better or worse, has made me a Thai food snob. I came here after reading reviews about the authenticity of the food. We had the Tom yum, which was watered down and tasted simply like chicken broth, som tum (papaya salad) that was neither spicy, nor sweet, nor sour, and larb (minced chicken) that was equally tasteless. The owner was out telling (yelling) stories, which was amusing at first, but he could use some coaching of when enough is enough. I wouldn't recommend coming here."
2,"This is a weird place. I went with my brother and sister in law over Christmas and our friends didn't know they had to reserve a table beforehand. We put out name on the list and stood around drinking, singing with the band, going to the patio for those who smoked, and closed the place but never did get a table. Never ever. No table for us, so no food ordered or paid for. Just beer. I was glad they cut you off after so many beers, because one of our party had gotten her hands on an extra one after she was cut off and thrown out. (She needed to be thrown out.) But then she broke her leg out front. Crazy night, and I would've liked to try the food but won't be back. Once was enough."
2,"There was nobody in this joint when we got there which kinda threw us off but we were looking for a low key place to just chill anyway so seemed perfect. \n\nWe had already went out to eat before and just wanted a little something to nibble on so got the calamari, which were really good. Not too chewy, light batter. They have a pretty good drink menu and the music is nice and relaxing. Definitely a chill vibe going on. The waitress didn`t seem too happy to be there though at first. She was kind of dragging her feet. She seemed alright as time progressed.\n\nWhen we called for the cheque, this is where it went downhill. Another waitress came to bring it to us and totally mixed all our drinks together. It was only 2 bills, not sure how it can get so messed up. The 2nd time around, they still got it wrong. It seemed to take forever to correct it. She just ended up not charging me for one of my drinks. \n\nHow can a place so relaxing end up being so stressful in the end!!"
4,"I'm a grandma, and that affects this review.  I live about 40 minutes away from this Ace, but am often in the area to babysit grandkids. I find the staff very helpful and understanding when I've gone there with my grandkids.  About a month ago, I had all 3- ages 7, 5, 4.  I had prepped them on proper behavior when in the store, and when we walked in, there was a big M&M display that wowed them.  They were  excitedly noisy, and when an older male employee walked over to them, I thought he was going to admonish them; instead, he engaged them in a conversation about favorite kinds of M&Ms.  Nice.  Then, the female cashier invited them to the counter and let them choose some lollipops from a bag she pulled from behind the counter.  \nThen today I went there with just the 5 year old grandson who was wearing a plastic fireman's helmet.  A young male employee came up to us right away, asked if I needed help, and  took me right to the curtain rods.  An older male employee stopped  and said, \""Hey, we need to salute the fire chief.\""  They both saluted my grandson who returned the salute.  Doubly nice.   \nI asked my son if he shops there and he said that if he needs something quick and knows exactly what he needs, Ace is the place.  I really appreciate the helpful attitude I've encountered.\nAnother note: I frequently buy online, mainly from Amazon.  When I was writing this review, it occurred to me to look at Amazon for the tension curtain rods that I bought at Ace today.  I do not know if they are the same brand, but Ace's price was about $2 less than Amazon."

4,"I have had a lot of boba in a lot of different places and my go to is milk tea. I ordered the milk tea boba at Tea Snow and was blown away by the flavor! The richest, most flavorful milk tea I have ever had. The boba was prepared just right as well. Not overly chewy and not slimy. \n\nLoved it!"
0,Paid for some repair work here. After the problem continued I took it to another mechanic. I was informed that the spark plugs and air filter for the ac I paid to be replaced were never done. When I spoke with them regarding this issue they were very rude and aggressive.
0,"Argh!  Thought I could get some simple tires put on my car at this location.  Not a chance!  They took forever and now the car shakes going down the road.  Also, when trying to get it fixed, they made me wait for days!  Forget going back....need to find another place to get my car balanced now."
2,"Blehhhh, blehhhh, blehhhhh! I did not like this place at all!  Ordered the chicken fried rice, yuckkk!  I had them take it back, I ended up replacing it with the chicken lettuce wraps, thankfully they were good and much better than my other dish but I've had better lettuce cups.  If your in Vegas, skip this place there are so many other good places to visit.  Even the other people in our party said their food was bland and they had to drench it in the hot sauce to make it taste good. =("
0,"Went to the store to buy an Xbox One for titan fall and the girl could not answer any of my questions. It took 25 mins to pre-order the system. Asked about a surface pro 1 and 2 she took me to a RT which is not what I wanted, She then went on to tell me that the only difference from the 1 and 2 is price .... Good Selling. Asked about student pricing could not get it for me and said she had to go in the back and grab a surface to scan it to get me a price.... after waiting 10 mins I walked... \n\nIf you know everything about the product then go here and buy.. If you have questions do not shop here staff is not helpful"
4,"Best tacos in Phoenix! I spent a summer in Guadalajara, Mexico, and these tacos remind me of a gourmet version of their street tacos. Soooo delicious! I go here at least once a week! I recommend the Pernil tacos and the Carne Asada, but I just recently tried the Empenadas and found them to be the tastiest that I've ever had. The people are great there and the cocktails are exceptional. They have some very unique cocktails like one with wasabi, but also have old favorites such as house-brewed sangria. Come at Happy Hour when everything is really cheap: $3 tacos and $6 cocktails."
0,"The worst service ever. And I'm not a rude person, at all. I said \""please\"" and \""thank you.\"" And I absolutely was not greeted whatsoever. Whoever that dumbass lady was, that was working needs to take that stick out of her. Don't be mad at me 'cause you hate YOUR job, bitch. Let's not forget that everyone is REPLACEABLE, including your miserable self. It took every bit of me not to cuss her out. I'd write a letter to corporate but she did not give me a receipt. Go figure right. I'm not one to talk down on people that works fast food because it's not in my character to knock someone's hustle. But she really needs to get it together. And for that, I will NOT ever return to this McDonald's ever again. Some bullshit. Oh. And. Not only did I not get a receipt... I didn't get a straw. And instead of 10 piece chicken nuggets, I got 9. What in the fucking fuck..... Fuck that McDonalds."
4,"Lifepower is my favorite place to practice yoga in the area. I frequent the hot vinyasa classes and I love them! The music and the atmosphere is so fun. I'm always sweaty afterwards, so I appreciate the facility's nice locker room and showers."
3,"Very Clean. Area for snacks and large changing table room. Owners were very approachable. My children loved it for the 3 hours we were there. It was very busy around 10 am. I do live in CA, and I think it's a bit overpriced for an indoor playroom, typically around $8-$10 here."
4,"I found Grimm Bindery online while looking for a place to bind a genealogical collection of transcribed letters and photographs I had put together for a client. I had the pages printed in Massachusetts and mailed them to the bindery in Wisconsin. Everyone I interacted with was extremely helpful and friendly. They stayed in touch with me throughout the process and shipped the final product to my client, who was absolutely overjoyed with the results. These books will be in their family for generations. Thank you to Grimm Bindery for the beautiful work!"
3,"Dan Dan Noodles. I can't get past that on the menu. It's a must have. \n\nChile seared soy sauce, minced chicken, scallions, garlic, bean sprouts, cucumbers, egg noodles...good. \n\nGreat take out or dine in. I know it's a chain, but a good restaurant feel. \n\nSelf serve fortune cookies....how many have you taken?"
2,"Late night half off was great! Besides having to wait 20 minutes to get a table, I overall liked my visit. \n\nThe portions are huge for the value. Would not have gone if it wasn't half off though. I shared the nachos with steak between three other people, and that was really good and cheesy. For myself I got the chicken chimi. The accents of lime (in a friend's enchilada) and the seasoning on the chicken chimi were appreciated. I'll definitely want to come back on another night to try other things on their menu. \n\nAlso, on a last note, we'd asked the waitress about the portions, and compared to all the other items, the quesadillas were the smallest portions."

4,"Everyone writes reviews of places they love. I've written plenty about how much I love Rise And Shine here in Las Vegas. Well, you learn WAY MORE when things DON'T go perfectly: This Sunday, my wife and I were seated at \""that\"" table. Y'know, the mystical spot where ONE waiter thinks it's the other waiter's, and the other one thinks it's the OTHER waiter's. Consequently, we waited 10 minutes with no greeting at all, and watched later arrivals on both sides get attention while we were ignored. Right around the time we were thinking \""Let's get outta here\"", the hostess (Shannon) came over, and with true concern told us that she had noticed we had been waiting, and wanted to help. She took our order herself, gave us a 2-for-1 coupon, and brought us our food herself... then she checked back TWICE during our meal to make sure everything was OK, checked us out promptly while mentioning that she recognized my wife and I as \""regulars\"", and was extremely pleasant and made friendly conversation, introduced herself and asked our names, and again took great care to apologize for the delay. All I was thinking was \""WOW\"". Look, I GOTTA testify, their food is good enough to treat people like dirt and still succeed - the fact that they care so much makes it a NO-BRAINER. I've  trained Customer Service for a living for over 26 years, I know what I'm looking at -  Thank you, Shannon, thank you, Rise And Shine!"
2,"I actually really liked LAX, stop two on our \""club crawl\"" with a tour company.  We were there only an hour and ended up not even buying a drink since we had drinks on the way, what I liked about this place was the multi-level and the dance floor was the largest of the three clubs we hit that night.  I didn't feel as smooshed.  Still no sitting unless you buy a table, but although we did not buy one, my understanding is you can get bottles/tables a little cheaper here than the newer \""fancier\"" clubs.\n\nAs for the music and the people, I pretty much thought it was exactly the same as what I had just seen & heard at 1OAK.  We danced until they said it was time for us to leave and had a good time here.  If I want to hit a club when I'm back in Vegas, I'm likely to return here."
2,The Panda Express of Filipino fast food. I been coming here since high school. they have more selections than the comparable Filipino restaurants around. I love coming here for breakfast because everything is fresh! I just wish they renovate the place or maintain it. Food is good but I'm just skeptic about what goes on in the back and overall cleanliness of the place. I'm from the Philippines tho so I don't mind much but for American standards it's something to think about.
3,This place is a must try restaurant that is worth the travel to an area that most would never even think to bother going for dinner. The atmosphere in this place is fantastic and once people start realizing that its here I think it will be packed on must nights so get here fast and be one of the first to discover a great find.
4,"I'm always on the look-out for good Pad Thai, and I'd driven by Ocha for months and still not given them a try... until last night.  And it was fabulous.  Not too sweet, not too hot (but with hot sauce on the side).  It was the best I've had in Las Vegas, with huge portions and not expensive.  A definite repeat for me."
4,"Great fun!  We had a blast watching the performer and the audience participation.  Definitely a fun afternoon, would recommend to all ages."
3,"Busy location during prime time hours, but you're stupid if you come here (or anywhere on 83rd ave.) on Friday or Saturday night and expect it to not be busy.\n\nWeekday lunch is great here with the extensive menu, especially appetizers, and of course the dessert.\n\nWhat I like the most is the good service because they seem to have a good corporate model for training their employees.  I want to see the perma-smile even if the server is having a sucky day, and you can't over-service me or ask if I want another beer too many times.  I drink a lot, I tip well, so I'm not the person that you want to have an empty glass with on the table.  This place gets it."
4,"Since moving here I've been searching for an authentic taco joint that reminds me of Chicago....look no more. Cheap, delicious street tacos. Our meal arrived with a side of grilled onions and jalapenos and plenty of lime wedges.\n\nFish tacos-Fantastic and not at all skimpy on the fish.\nMemelitas-Fantastic. It's like a mini, thick corn tortilla topped with beans, cheese, cilantro and onions. I don't eat meat, but you could get meat if you want.\nQuesadilla-Fantastic. Corn tortilla stuffed with cheese and herbs, fried, then topped with blacks beans, cheese & lettuce.\n\nAside from loving the food I liked the owner and the extremely versatile customers. I also like to support local businesses."
3,"Wow.  The food is DIVINE.  I haven't experienced flavors that intense in years.  I would've given it 5 stars, except the atmosphere is way too stuffy for me.  Really expensive great food doesn't mean it can't have a more fun atmosphere..."
4,"I've been to Maestro's Ocean Club 6-7 times, and each time it does not disappoint - It . Is . Fabulous .  \n\nThis past weekend we ordered the Oyster's Rockefeller to start with and they were as delicious as always. For our entrees, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and my boyfriend ordered the Filet Oscar Style - both dishes were amazing. Spinach and mushroom sides were also very good - this place is exceptional. For dessert we shared the key lime pie, and it was surprisingly a large slice - loved it! Usually we get the signature warm butter cake for dessert and it is heavenly. \n\nOverall, we love Maestros' Ocean Club. The service is always impeccable and then food outstanding. The bar area has live music and is a perfect place to people watch. The dining room on the other side is also very nice and a bit quieter. I would recommend Maestro's Ocean Club to anyone for any occasion or just a regular day."
0,"What is with the employees at this place?  We have been here a few times because.... well I'll be honest.... we're Blizzard addicts and it's the closest DQ to our house now that the one on Tropical closed down.\n\nBut if we weren't the hard core Blizzard fans we are... I would NEVER give this place my business.  Every time we walk through the door, the teenagers working behind the counter act like we are irritating them with our very existence.  One night we got there about 45 minutes before closing time and as we were sitting there trying to enjoy our ice cream, they put up all the chairs onto the tables around us and kept staring at us like we were keeping them late.   Seriously?\n\nThis place needs some kind of management to step in and whip the employees into shape...  Or I might have to start driving all the way down to the DQ on Tenaya and Alexander.  At least the employees are friendly there."
2,"I was dining alone last night and sushi sounded like a great option.  The wait for a table was quite long, but being alone I was allowed to grab a spot at the sushi bar.  I've eaten here twice before, and it's always good.  The fish is very fresh and well prepared.  I had mackerel, salmon, and the onion soup.  Not very much food, but I'd traveled all day and just wanted a light meal.  It was tasty and satisfying for what I wanted.  I'd rate it 4 stars, but the service was TERRIBLE.  The maitre' d didn't seat me, just said go ahead, which caused some confusion because the place is like a maze and the server didn't come help me for quite some time.  Once she did, my meal was delivered relatively quickly, but I had to ask for chopsticks and a dipping tray, the server never refilled my water, and I had to remind her twice that I'd asked for my check.  As other reviewers have said, it's a bit pricey for sushi, but ya gotta remember... this is Vegas baby!"
1,"I applaud their creativity with the slices.  I was excited to see a place like this open on Green street, but damn, can you heat your slices?!  They sit there for hours and then they throw it a lukewarm oven for 30 seconds.  I'll eat cold pizza, but I'm not paying $2.50-$3 a slice for it!"
0,"There's 2 things my boyfriend and I love on their menu: chips & queso and steak nachos. We come in 1-2 times a month, sit at the bar, tip well and usually leave fat and happy. Tonight however, I'm leaving with a horrible taste in my mouth thanks to management. Here's how it went down:\n\n\""We'd like the steak nachos\""\n\""We're out of steak, we only have ground beef\"" \n\""Can you sub out the steak you use for the fajitas?\""\n\""Uhh probably not.\""\n\""Why not? We want steak nachos, you have steak and nachos, I don't understand\"" \n\""Hold on let me ask management\""\n\""Management, no because we're almost out of steak\""\n\nSo instead of maybe having to 86 steak fajitas later in the evening, they said no to two regular customers, just in case. Bad idea. \n\nRule #1 of hospitality, always do everything you can to accommodate the guest. \n\nRule #2 keep regulars happy. \n\nWe will not be returning."
1,"Me and the lovely went here on a Groupon buy and I so wanted to love it. Sorry to say we did not. We were seated by a very friendly host, next to a map of Thailand painted on the wall and the bar opposite. I felt a little like I'd been put in the back 40. \n\nWaiter was nice but a little clueless; I asked for a reco on what the house did best. He totally stammered and stared at his feet and finally said 'a lot of people get the whole fish'. Not wowed. A nice wine list helped but I have had better Thai food elsewhere. No kefir lime leaves in the Panang, no fresh basil...I get it was their version but I didn't think it was great and neither did the lovely. To top it off, stammering waiter man/boy brings the check and says did you want anything for desert? Um. No thanks. \n\nIt would have been a pricey meal had we not had the Groupon [$40 food for $20]. $52 plus tip for just okay and not such a nice atmosphere? I say, meh."
0,"What a fucking joke. Book a room in the west tower and get here to find that they OVERBOOKED so they stick my ass in the manor lodge that is less expensive, without refunding the difference. I WAS a frequent guest at this hotel, staying here every couple of months but after this stunt, that will not be happening again. This is how you treat loyal guests? You just lost one."
4,"Nice, small shop located just West of the corner of Sahara & Las Vegas Blvd. Friendly & helpful staff. Resonable prices."
2,"A lot better than I remembered, but I guess it's because they remodeled. Not a horrible hotel, but more for families. If you're coming here with a bunch of friends and want a more 'happening' scene, don't stay here. unless you're on a budget because the rooms are way cheaper than other areas of the strip. but remember, if you stay here because the rooms are cheaper, remember that cab fair to major clubs like XS or Tao will be higher since you're further down the road. So that may cancel out your savings."
3,"I jumped for my birthday a few months back (sssshhh, don't tell my mom).  I went in a couple of days prior to scope the place out.  At first, the staff seems slightly insane.  At a second glance, they really are just a little off their rockers.  However, in their craziness lies an inherent sense of fun and professionalism seemlessly blended in to a soothing and calming atmosphere that makes the fear of jumping off an 855 foot platform not so bad.  They joke with you.  They taunt you.  They are loud and in your face.  But they don't miss a single step when it comes to safety checks.  They check you on the ground.  They check you twice (two different people) up top to make sure absolutely nothing has been missed.  They talk you through what is going to happen as you jump.  They don't pressure you to do anything you don't really want to do.  And when the time comes, they count you down and you jump.  It was a thrilling experience.  I was shaking for several minutes afterwards from the adrenaline.  I loved almost all of it.  All but the landing.  Like an idiot I locked my legs instead of absorbing the impact by bending my knees.  This sent a painful shock up my back.  I ached for about an hour.  If you go, bend your knees.  That is my biggest advice to you.  Oh, and opt for the HD DVD.  It is worth it to hear the experience time and time again."
4,"OK.  Been to a few barber shops in my time for straight edge shaves, and Vinnie is right on up there with the best.  I decided to get a shave when I was staying at Vdara and my wife went to the spa (she's getting something for herself, I might as well get a little pampering as well).  I saw Vinnie at the Aria location.  Yes, it's in the spa/salon so it does seem a little weird that you're going to where all the ladies are getting whatever it is they do for their hair... but tucked away in the corner and a little out of sight is a room with 1 chair just for guys.  Awesome.  Tucked away where you don't have to hear girl talk and where a guy and his barber can just be guys with sports on the tube and talk about guy stuff!"
3,We stopped in after seeing a movie because we just wanted to try something new. The falafel was excellent as well as the hummus. The place was rather empty but at least the food was good. I give it a 4 out of 5 because I wouldn't pay for one of their 20 dollar dishes but I was fine paying 8 for a really good falafel pita. I would definitely go back.
2,"YES to the samosas. They are flavorful, steamy hot, and come with a delicious sauce. NO to the curries - ha, go figure. Unless you like liquidy, oily, flavorless broth with chunks of meat inside. Also, NO to the water. It tastes very chlorinated.\n\nNote the door on the left is STUCK so don't be discouraged and try, try again!"
4,I only get out here a few times a year and am always delighted at how good this place is. The Italian beef rules!
1,"Disappointing! My bf and I stopped in for a drink and light snack in between flights and decided we shouldn't order food based on quick look around... The place smelled like a dirty rag which was almost nauseating. We sat down at the bar for a drink and the dishes were piled up, occupying about 4 feet of bar space. We ended up leaving after our first drink and went over to the Pei Wei bar which had much better service."
4,We have been taking our dog here for a few years now and we Love this place. They do a great job and are very friendly.
1,"We went here for a wedding reception, so I am not sure of the pricing.  House chardonnay was good. I ordered the scallops for an appetizer, and my husband had the risotto--they were both out of this world!  Service was great too--they even brought me a tiny chair for my purse which cracked me up! For the main, my hubby had the flank steak and I had roasted chicken. He liked his, but I didn't have 1 bite of my dry, flavorless chicken. Ick. Next time I would go and just share some appetizers, because those were divine!"
0,"Came in Saturday, a little after 5:00, very few customers and plenty of staff. We sat for several long minutes before they finally figured out who would serve us. The food came quickly, and was hot but just adequate. The lobster ravioli tasty fishy and the chicken was dry. It had been a long time since we had been to a Macaroni Grill. We see no reason to rush back."
2,"Everything was great! Service, food ... Except for the sushi .... The volcano roll had huge cucumber chunks that made it difficult to eat. After removing the cucumber the roll was okay."
0,"Bad business practice. Poor management. They do not back up their employees mistakes. Be aware of their cancellation policy upfront. If an employee says something to you, you may want to get it in writing, video taped and notarized as they do NOT own up to their mistakes. My problem was partially resolved which still unacceptable to me. Our family will NOT look at LA Fitness for gym needs in the future. \n\nFacility- this particular location at night is mainly frequented by muscle head male members. It was a little uncomfortable to me being the only women in the place most nights I came in. I did not come in during the day. Some nights smelled funny and others smelled of tons of chemicals. I did not use this facility enough to comment on the equipment or anything else. I never interacted with the staff, only the front door person. \n\nThe sales people I interacted with is very pushy and annoying. They will not stop calling you. LA Fitness is about numbers not retention or quality service."
2,"Well I have only stayed here one time so far, for the Viva Las Vegas rockabilly weekender 2009. It was the first time for this event to be held here, it was always at the Gold Coast Hotel (same chain) which I really liked. Unfortunately the staff was very unprepared for the onslaught of hundreds of rockabilly people. I found a lot of the staff to be very rude, condescending, and unhelpful. The pool was cold and very overly chlorinated. The pool didn't open until late morning and closed early as well as not being in the sun most of the day. The water in the room faucet and shower  smelled like sulfur the whole stay, as well as having a general sulfur smell outside of the hotel as well. Perhaps the hotel is just fine when there is not a large event there, especially a music oriented one, but we are not staying there for this year's event. Hopefully they will be nicer and more prepared this year, if so, we may stay there for the 2011 Viva."
1,"Just okay. I was craving Mexican good but didn't feel like getting out of car on way home, so I bought the yelp promo! Thank goodness I only paid $5! The carnitas was tough and dry, the red chile meat was the cheapest cut of meat allowable for human consumption. Not all bad though, the rice and beans were good. And the $.99 tostada was good too. IF I go back, it will be for rice, beans and tostada. Afraid to try anything else!"
3,"The wait staff from the late, lamented Ed Devebic's [I know that's not spelled right!!] landed on their feet at 5 & Diner!! Yep, you can still dine with Pebbles, Minnie Mouse and Grocho at this stainless steel and mirrored tribute to the 1950s. Yummmm! \n\nWe were just there again last night for sliders and iced tea. The shakes are also the thing here, not many tables but there's usually a place at the counter, the prices are great and it's just a lot of fun. \n\nBut the tableside jukebox didn't work last time...sigh. Other than that it's a fun fab place for 24-hour dining!!"
1,"This was a great novel thing back in the day\nA Chinese restaurant that offered boofay\nOh but the times they have a-change-ed\nAnd Hong Kong has not arrange-ed\nTo keep up with their competition\nOr to make any change or addition\nTo the way they've always done it\nSo despite the fire that tried to run it \nTo the ground a few years back\nHong Kong lingers, although quite whack,\nThe ghosts of americhino lovers' past forays\nWill haunt this MSG pit 'till its dying days."
0,"How this place has such great reviews really boggles my mind. Do the people from Las Vegas have a much lower standard for quality? My boyfriend & I came here for breakfast before going to the movies last weekend. There was a large line, which I didn't mind because I assumed the food would make up for it. I ordered the drunken gypsy toast, which was pretty good, however I had asked for a side of turkey bacon, and they gave me pork bacon, which I do not eat, FORTUNATELY I could tell before taking a bite. My boyfriend ordered the 3 Happy Chicks, which SHOULD have been called the 3 RUNNY Chicks! The eggs were so undercooked they might as well have left them in the shell! There was yolk all over the plate, covering all the other food. In the middle of attempting to eat, I told the staff 1, my drink never came & 2, they have me pork bacon instead of turkey. They brought me my drink, but never my bacon. I asked my boyfriend how his bacon was, he said to salty to even eat. The only good thing about this place is that our dog got a huge goodie bag when we got home."
4,"Oh my gosh..  This restaurant is amazing.  Love the patio and the atmosphere of the restaurant.  The blue corn tortillas are totally yum.  (Mouthwatering just thinking about it.).  They have great margaritas and menu. \n\nIf you have not been here, go like NOW!!! If you are ever in the Phoenix area, you need to try this place out.\n\nIt is a casual place with a higher end price (otherwise if you are on a limited budget, this is a special occasion place)."
3,Excellent - especially for airport food. The carne asada tacos were great.
1,"Nothing special about this hotel. The rooms are standard. This is 2-stars as compared to other strip hotels. It's most certainly better than normal hotels in all respects.\nGentlemen, there is no security at the elevator shafts."
3,"Nice club, but smells very smokey, nice older crowd!  My only thing the night we went it only was about steppers!  People trying to get you to let them teach you stepping!   Ummmm, I'm not about to pay $50.00 per session!  I'm not that into stepping, and I will get on youtube if I want to learn for free!"
1,I wasn't too impressed. The spicy chicken wasn't spicy (to my standard) and seemed kind bland. I may try something else next time and see if my opinion changes.
3,"I'm eager to go back to this place, the crepes were delicious and they had a wide variety to choose from. The food was excellent but the service is so so."
4,"Cute, yummy and affordable! My fave sushi place in Vegas so far. The staff is accomodating and friendly. The sushi are good. The uni and tower poke is a must try. Baked sushi are good too. Nigiri without rice is good as well. This place is cheaper than others but offers good and fresh sushi. Oh try \""the shit\"" appetizer. And FYI, they dont have chirashi on their menu but they made one for me. Plus, they have kids menu."
3,"One of my Go to buffets in Vegas! If you're a MLife member (Pearl and up? Or was it just any MLife level?) You get a special line, so don't wait in line for an hour! \n\nI love Aria buffet and after eating here at least a good dozen times, I can honestly recommend it to everybody. Unlike a lot of the buffets, here, it has a feeling of airiness. It's bright, inviting, and has a view of the Aria pools (which may or may not be good news).  When I'm getting down and stuffing my mouth, I don't want to feel claustrophobic or think the ceilings are about to cave in.\n\nEvery time I go it's packed, which is a good sign because food is constantly being replaced and made. I love the crab legs and if I had my way, I would be there all day. \n\nThe downside is that it's pricey for the amount of food available. Good thing MGM resorts always have those free buffet vouchers available! A good thing to remember is to check for promo codes online before you book at their properties. They let you eat at most of their buffets regardless of location. Aww yeah."
3,"PF Changs is one of the only good Chinese restaurants I've been to in a long time. It's a china bistro so it's nothing like your traditional corner restaurant with the buffet. \n\nTheir food is good but I normally wouldn't come back to eat all the time if it wasn't for the lettuce wraps ::cue the heavenly angel singing::. I love their lettuce wraps and even though I could successfully mimic them at home I don't want to have to go through the mess of all the condiments to make the lettuce wrap sauce ::cue singing again::. \n\nThey also give you the choice between brown rice and white rice. I bet that excites you huh? I know, I just like the idea of being able to go to a Chinese restaurant and eating a light meal that's good for you. Service is good and so is the rest of the food (which is family size portioned) but the only thing that I ever get are the lettuce wraps. They have a choice of chicken or veggie (I prefer the chicken but they are both just as good). I like it. I like it a lot."
0,"I have never met a pediatric specialist who is utterly unable to interact with both children and parents. He is condescending to his office staff and has the one of the highest turnover of staff in the valley.  He told my 6 year old she needs to go find another dentist if she doesn't look him in the eye and that he won't be able to have a relationship with her if she doesn't answer his questions. He similarly treated my 4 and 3 year old and kept calling me mom.  Needless to say, he does a lot of xray and does not thoroughly examine the actual children.\n\nDo not go there. You will regret it and you might take longer after to take your children to a dentist again, which is what happened to us. I am writing this review 12 months after our visit there. I wanted to make sure that I still felt the same way after some time.\n\nI can only say good things about the people in his office. Who I am sure are by now not there anymore."
4,I love this place for the carefully selected menu and the amazing cocktails. It deserves a lot more business.
0,This place is ridiculous! I went here even AFTER seeing the distasteful reviews on yelp only because they had a management change so they said but that's deceiving as well! I took my 10 yo daughter here and she had a cleaning and she had X-rays and a flourish treatment and more X-rays for later in case we wanted to use them for ortho and  was told that my insurance company authorized everything well they lied. A month later I received a bill in the mail for $150 and because they had to deal with the insurance company they sent me to collections well not me but my 10 yo daughter! I'm still dealing with these idiots till this day! I'm not even sure which direction to turn. The insurance company tells them it was covered just a basic and then I get billed for flouride and an extra set of X-rays! Be very very careful
4,"Real deal BBQ. No plates, no fancy napkins, no tablecloths, just really good BBQ. People have covered the menu pretty thoroughly, so I'll just toss in our support for the pulled pork, the baby back ribs, the chicken and the sides. Superb all around. The meats were not over-smoked, and the sauces worked well to complement the meat rather than disguise it.\n\nThe standouts sidewise were the corn nuggets, and the Kickin' beans. The beans had a healthy amount of meat in them and were nicely seasoned. The corn nuggets...don't order the corn nuggets, for all that is holy. They are like crack - instantly addictive. By themselves, dipped in the house sauce, shoved in your ear...you just can't stop eating the little devils.\n\nSweet tea made by somebody from the South, that's for sure. Not overly sugared...just right. \n\nThe place is a dive, and that's what sold me on it before I ever set foot in the door. We were the first ones to get there that day for lunch, so Eddie behind the register had time to chat. Nice guy, and a great salesman for the place. By the time we were done eating, at least 6 parties of locals had queued up, paid for their lunches and commenced to chowing down. Get there early is all I can say.\n\nAll in all, a near-perfect BBQ experience. They lose the perfect game by being just too damn far from my house!! I have to wait until I go to Vegas to get my fix! Next week, in fact. Drooooooool. This time I'm going beef.\n\nNote for out-of-towners - the place is really easy to find. Head north on Las Vegas Blvd. and turn left immediately after Fashion Show Mall (Fashion Show Dr). When the road ends (S. Highland Dr.), turn right. You can see the place from the intersection on the left, just past the freeway overpass."
1,"I don't see what the big deal is. When I went the soda machine was broken, and the food was bland. Didn't really think the fries were anything to care about. Very sub-par, and more over, just because they give you all you can eat, free peanuts, doesn't mean you should pay so much for a burger or hot dog. Not worth the money, not worth the trip in my opinion. Wouldn't return, wouldn't recommend."
3,"Great food and service! This was our first first to the East Blvd location and we were impressed. I ordered the enchiladas de pollo and the wife ordered steak quesadillas. Both were great with bold flavor. The rice and beans were some of the best I have had; I was impressed from the first bite. \n\nService was friendly, quick, and knowledgeable. A new glass of Coke was dropped off every time I was halfway through the previous. \n\nLooking forward to our next visit!"
1,"I believe tonight will be my family's last visit to this buffet.  With 2 kids under 5, this place has become UN-kid friendly. As of June 17th 2012 kids under 2 are free. So we basically have to pay $12.99 for my 3 year old son to eat. Screw that!! When my husband and I only pay $13.99 with a players card why the hell would I pay $12.99 for my 3 year old to drink apple juice and eat greasy macaroni with a few pieces of fruit?!  Whoever made this change in their pricing must be out of their mind. Nice way to lose customers.  \n\nAnother annoying thing is how slow the line moves. After you've paid you have to wait to be seated. If its taking a while to seat people then that means those who have paid are still standing right in front of the cash register cause there is nowhere for them to go. So the cashier just stands there and waits until they are out of the way to ring up the next person. All this goes on while the cashier at the \""VIP\"" register stands there and chit chats because he has no body in his line. One would think he'd ring up the next person from the normal people line, but no he doesn't. Us normal folks must not be good enough for that. \n\nBy the time you get seated you are so annoyed!\n\nNow I'll get to the food. It's ok. Your standard buffet food.  It's the Feast so you have Asian, Mexican, Italian, American, a carving station, salad bar, Mongolian grill, and desserts.  I'm pretty sure I didn't miss anything. Oh, we visited in a Friday night at 5:30. There was about 10 people ahead of us and it took 20 minutes just to pay. We didn't have to wait to be seated cause our party was already inside. \n\nThere is nothing special about this buffet. I wouldn't be sad if I never went there again."
1,"tonight is saturday and we were the ONLY 3 people in there? yet, our server was below average...way below. had to ask twice for water and for beer refills. and salsa...had to ask twice for that as well. \n\nmy dish was ok. standard mex but very salty. i won't count our dinner companion because she is too picky (everything was wrong with her dish according to her). however, my girlfriend loved her fish with lettuce wrap dish...said it was \""the bomb\"", a phrase she has rarely used since entering her mid 30's! our prickly pear margaritas were quite tasty though, so a grand 4 stars for that.\n\nbut what made me give it only 2 stars was the service...we never, ever expect much because we know how hard it is to be a server...however, with us as the only customers, the service tonight was way off. overall, 50 bucks for 3 entrees, 2 margaritas and 2 beers."
3,We were very happy with our experience at Sekai sushi. The food and service were great both times we have been. The prices and location are very reasonable as well. We will definitely go back and we will be referring others.
4,"Christine at the west location gives the best massage ever! Her energy is amazing and that is what you need an exchange of light and wellness, along with excellent touch, Christine F you rock!\nThanks !!"
1,"Very average food at best,  from authentic Mexican food and very commercial. Chili con queso was just a bowl of melted processed cheese with zero flavor, just like those jars sold at grocery stores. Chicken enchiladas were extremely dry and again lacked flavor. On a good note, they have ice cold tecate on draft. Service was also good with friendly waitress. So if you want a nice cold beer go ahead and stop in, but if your hungry go elsewhere. Prices are pretty high too, especially when compared to food quality."
0,There's something wrong with having to pay $5 for ice cream that isn't flavorful. I much prefer Dave & Andy's - their waffle cones are amazing and you'll pay under $3 for some of the best ice cream you'll ever have.
1,"I heard from everyone that the Primanti sandwiches are the quintessential Pittsburgh food. \n\nWe scored a nice seat outside and indulged in some Iron Hill beer that was on special for $2 for a  20 oz beer. The sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive.\n\nBe warned that everything here comes with french fries, even the salads."
1,"Price for kitsch. Located in the far, far north, this historical ranch house has its own brand of run-down charm--until you see the flat-screen TV's hoisted awkwardly above the 1950's fireplace. Service is friendly, but the food is what you would get at a nice family barbeque. Like a birthday one. From the cheese bread (Wonder bread, maybe?) to the salad-out-of-a-bag to the plain-old steaks, everything is unequivocally boring. For a meal you could easily get at Applebees, the price is nuts. \nTo be fair, my parents love this place, so maybe the secret to loving the restaurant is to be over 50."
1,"In a word, dissapointed. I thought it would be much better. The bread was boring, my 25.00 Filet had no flavor. My mashed potatos and zuchini were good. My server did not want to be there. There were flies and the grass outside needed mowing and the trash picked up. I had a view of Reds Muffler Shop."
3,"I must say that I am totally pleased with my stay here at Vdara.  I am sure it helps that I was upgraded to a huge suite for no additional $.  However, the staff is pleasant...amenities are great and I love that there is no casino downstairs.  I have already booked my room here for my next visit."
4,"This place just moved to a new location at 3655 South Rainbow, in the Walmart, Sam'sClub, and Applebees shopping center. The online website still gives the old address.  \n\nOverall, prices are great.  Ink quality is gets the job done, but manufacturer ink is still the best.  Service is fast and friendly, which is why I like the place."
1,This place might be nice in the warmer weather but the restaurant was freezing and we had our coats on the whole meal. They also left the door open a crack to get the steam out from the kitchen. The service was slow the server was unpleasant and she didn't get us out on time for our show (which we mentioned several times including when we made our reservation). The food wasn't bad but a little overpriced.
0,"Although the bagels we got from Gotham were pretty tasty, our experience with them as a whole was incredibly disappointing.  My husband and I had them (the Mifflin St. location) cater a few simple breakfasts during our wedding weekend. Although all they had to do was deliver two dozen bagels literally a quarter mile, they were over an hour late on two of the three days, and brought all the wrong kinds of bagels on the third day. Moreover, the service was shockingly bad when my husband placed the initial order, and they never brought a final receipt to show how much we would be charged. When I called a week or so after the wedding to ask about the final charge, and to offer some comments on the service, I was told the owner would call me back within two hours. He never did. And when I called back a second time a few days later, I was assured that the owner would call me just as soon as he returned. You can guess how that turned out...I never heard back.  I will certainly never give Gotham Bagels my business again, and I'd recommend you stay away as well."
4,"YAY!  I loved this race :)  I run a lot of the local races in the San Diego area and this was my first \""big\"" race.  It's possible that I'm just googly eyed over the sheer size of this thing.  This was my first race with a full on, legitimate expo.  The expo was awesome and it totally pumped me up for the race the following day.  \nThe race itself was pretty darn cool.  There could have been a few more porta johns, both at the starting line and throughout the course.  The gear check in/pick up was convenient and very well organized.  They had SO many volunteers, it was great.  You could toss your warming layers at any point and there was a volunteer standing there to put it in a donation box.  The water stations were frequent and well staffed.  (Side note: there was a cytomax station before each water stationed - cytomax is HEINOUS - wish it would have been a different brand).  There was also 1 gu station (for the 1/2 - not sure about the full) during the course.  The bands were kind of cool, and since thats a huge part of the race, I feel like there should have been a few more bands - but the lack of bands didn't bother me.  I'm one of those weirdos who likes to run sans music.  \nLoved the medals, loved the photos, loved the race.  I'll be running this one again."
0,I found the sales staff to be quite rude and unhelpful. There were not enough people working at the cutting station so the line was long. There was no staff available to ask questions to; I could not find anyone when I looked. They are the only craft store that sells the item I need for a project so I am unfortunately going to have to go back. But I would rather take my business elsewhere.
2,"This place is okay for an $8 threading. I had higher expectations, but when I walked in, the lady was on the phone and was unable to listen to what I wanted. My brows came out thinner than I wanted- I purposely grew them out to have a thicker brow, but when I was explaining what I wanted and when she was threading one of my brows, she was still on the phone. Also, the threading hurt. I don't think it ever hurts much, but I was in pain and even had a drop of blood on a corner of one of my brows. I will keep looking for a great place. I might go back here if I needed to- although they are thin, my brows look even."
0,"I would give them NO stars at all if l could. I have never written a review and I'm usually not very picky but this was so awful I had to write one. I would NEVER recommend this place to anybody and this was the WORST customer service I have ever gotten. I usually don't have time to get my nails done and had today off so I decided to try this place. Worst idea ever. I walked in and was not greeted until about two minutes later and the employees just stared at me. Then I asked to get my nails painted with a gel polish. I took them less than 10 minutes to do it and it was extremely rushed. My nails were not even shaped right and one nail the paint was smudged. I pointed it out to her and she said she would fix it... She didn't. I felt like they didn't care for me as a customer and when you never take time for yourself and then do and walk away so upset, it's awful. I will NEVER go back to this salon and would NEVER recommend it. Not worth 20 bucks and now I have to go somewhere else to fix it. Not happy at all. Very disappointed."
4,"Marcello's is the best Italian restaurant in Arizona!  Their menu is large, and their specialties are many, every day!  I always order off the specialties, because they are too good to pass up!  The staff is phenomenal, and treat us like members of their own family.  To show our dedication to how much my family has embraced Marcello's, my husband and I had our rehearsal dinner there, and our fave servers were able to serve us.  Be sure to ask for John!"
4,"I cannot believe I have not reviewed this bakery gem, this little slice of Heaven, the sugary wonder, my sweet and reliable Suarez Bakery.  \n\nCream Horns-- seriously, the flakiest pastry shell, sprinkled with powdered sugar and filled full of the lightest, fluffiest frosting-like fill.  \n\nSnickerdoodles-- cinnamon sugar yuminess on top of an elephant ear like cookie/pastry.  \n\nElephant Ears-- a huge treat that is as large as a 5 year old's head (really).\n\nSugar cookies-- all shapes and decorations, perfectly sweetened to be able to eat several without feeling ill!  --- They also make these to order--- perfect for school parties that require cookies for decorating and the mom who does not bake!\n\nCupcakes-- all different flavors.  Delicious and lovely.\n\nCakes-- Tizzerts.  Need I say more?  Just the best cake you can put in your mouth... Our wedding cake was Tizzerts, and have had several other special occasion cakes from Tiz.\n\nThumb print cookies--  perfect for the little bit of sweet tooth, a small sugar cookie/ shortbread like cookie, topped with a smudge of frosting (this is my go-to treat).\n\nI do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of my family.  So my go-to is the thumb print cookie but, even without a sweet tooth, the temptations of all this goodness cannot be resisted.   We celebrate milestones and accomplishments and hard days and completed projects by occasionally popping into Suarez and picking out a delectable treat.  \n\n-- Seriously, the made to order cookies have saved me for years as a room mother who cannot bake--"
3,"We eat at their other location at Val Vista and Baseline.  Food is always terrific, they have the best sausages in town and the only great German Pancakes we've found.  Place is a little hole in the wall and nothing to look at, but we drive 40 miles for the food!"
2,"Gave this place 1 more try... Previous i was bundled into a takeout work order with coworkers and the food seemed mehhhh chinese places should make sure their rice is perfect... \n\nI tried the Chili Relleno and Jade Chicken W, Chicken Fried Rice. - dont like any kind of beans so got those wrapped to go,\n\nWife had Machaca n ???? pork fried rice and salad\n\nFood was average, nothing off the hook, but the mix of the cultures made for a good eat.. \n\nSeriously dont know how Guy Fieri came across this place,, definitely not a place to go out of your way to try.\nWe will maybe stop by every 3 months or so.."
1,"I'm not impressed. I'm a pretty big wing connoisseur and these wings are average. I've never been to any other Wings Over...locations, so I went into this pretty open.\n\nTheir online ordering is easy-peasy. I ordered a hefty selection to make sure I had a nice overview on what Wings Over can offer.\n\nThe \""boneless wings\"" to start with Wimpy Buffalo sauce. These aren't boneless wings; they are chicken tenders. The sauce was good, but the meat was dry, requiring lots of bleu cheese to compensate (I do love me some bleu cheese, though)!\n\nI also sampled the Honey BBQ, 7 Pepper, and Oriental Sesame. It's true; these wings are def meatier than other places. @Curtis G. enjoyed the Honey BBQ best while I preferred the 7 Pepper dry rub. Again, these wings were OK.\n\nI'm open to try new wing places, and I can give props to Wings Over for meaty wings and a varied selection of sauces.  However, I don't care how much meat you give me (ha ha) if it is dry and the nice sauce flavor is lost in a river of bleu cheese."
1,"I'll keep this short and straight to the point. I'm so dissapointed. I came in with a group of friends during the weekend. I asked for a basic mani-pedi. Payed 40$. The lady I had wasn't the most pleasent. While finishing my to\n coat she accidentally bumped a nail and instead of taking the polish off that finger and redoing it, she just put another topcoat over trying to cover it up. It was a glob of clear uneven nail polish on one finger... Clearly this isn't going to end well. I sat and let them all dry for over thirty min. As soon as I got in my car that nail was ruined, so I went back inside and had them fix it while they talked about me in Korean. \n\nAll in all it was not worth it. My mani (even after they fixed the bad nail) only lasted one full day. My pedicure didn't even last a week. For a pedicure not to last at least a week is absurd in my opinion. \n\nI won't be back."
2,"The most important thing to understand: this place is FUN.  But the food isn't great.\n\nWhat do I mean?  Well, each table is covered in white paper on which you can just go to town with the provided crayons.  Trivial pursuit cards and other bits of trivia on cardboard from other games are supplied in dishes usually reserved for sugar packets.  There's a fantastic beer selection, and you can walk right up to the rows of refrigerators and pick your own bottle.  It's just a fun place.\n\nNow, the food is where they run into some problems.  I went in a group of 4, and I can't recommend anything we had.  My salmon sandwich was so-so at best.  I tried someone else's deep fried Italian hoagie--which sounds AMAZING (in a totally sing-songy voice), but it somehow isn't.  It tasted like a sandwich of bland pepperoni and ham in a different bun, without anything else.  They have that tried and true Pittsburgh bar staple--the giant fish sandwich--but it didn't taste any better or worse than any other place.  And the fourth item (the only one I didn't try) was a burger ordered by the final member of our party--he says it was good, but he didn't even finish it.\n\nSo: good for drinking (though you can't really get there without designated drivers), great for having fun, bad for foodies or if you just want a meal."
1,"I ate here about a year ago. Service was excellent, food was actually pretty bad. I ordered a filet medium that came out medwell and with no seasonings to speak of. The auhgraten potatoes tasted like old baked potato diced up and thrown in a pot of Cheddar cheese ... I was shocked. My wife and I paid alot for sub par food. Outback does better for cheaper on a bad night."
3,"This place has a cute, cozy ambiance and good food. Husband and I started with the warm brie, which was nicely complimented with plenty and fruits and breads. Unlike a lot of places that serve similar dishes, there was actually enough stuff to use up the cheese. I had the roast chicken, a simple dish that is hard to execute well and husband enjoyed his steak. My chicken was very fresh and well complimented by the sides. We also enjoyed the well selected wine list. Definitely plan to return."
4,"So.... How to begin.... I've been here twice in one day to eat.... And u know what that means?  The food rocked! :-)  I'm picky about who I give my 5 starts to.  I know I am! Can't help it especially since I'm in the food industry. :-)\n\nLunch was a simpler easier menu that seemed based off of quick and easily to share food.  Duh. Tapas style u know? :-D it had a good range of Korean and Japanese.  The kimchi fried rice,  bi bim bap and yakisoba (made with udon noodles) were YUMMILICIOUS.  :-) I had other dishes but those three were my favorites but everything I had was good.  :-)\n\nDinner was more \""fine dining\"" style. I had the 30 hour Berkshire pork... melt in your mouth fatty deliciousness. Yum! The crust on the chicken wing was so light and yet so delicious.  They cook the chicken sous vide in curry for an added depth of flavor before tossing in whichever sauce u choose.  OMG. Delicious and so crispy.  :-)  Black bean noodle (jja-jjang-myun) with egg white noodle... totally was not expecting the noodle but the mouth chew was fantastic.  Love love loved it!  \n\nAnd if u like SPICY food, ask the server about their soon to be added to the menu spicy ramen noodle.  I love heat and it brought it!  So spicy and yet I could not stop eating it! :-) just thinking about it is making me drool. :-P\n\nOverall, I can't wait to come and eat here again... whether lunch or dinner both menus were over the top awesome! :-)"
3,"Got the create your own tacos for 7.25, soft flour, carne asada, asadero cheese, and pico de gallo salsa. For what seems like whole on wall (it'd be easy to miss this restaurant since it's not facing the street and it's next to coin laundry). The wait was worth it. Carne asada was very good. I agree with one of the reviewers, price for a lot of items on the menu is kind of on the high side. If you are in Madison, a must-go foodie place."
0,"I actually never was able to try the food here. I got so pissed at the girl taking my order that I left. What happened? Well listen to this...I decided on a sandwich..I am not sure of the name , but it had roast beef and some sort of yummy cheese and the other sandwich stuff they add to it. Well I am not a fan of veggies, i know, that's so childish, but it is what it is. Anyway, I tell the girl what I want and I let her know I want the roast beef sandwich with only cheese and mayo, no veggies. She then looks very puzzled...\"" you just want cheese and mayo on bread\""? I said no....I want the roast beef with just cheese and mayo. She then says that it does not make any sense....\""so you don't want the meat\""? I then ask her...why would I order \""roast beef\"" and then not want the meat? She is like well I dont know you are the one that ordered it that way. Im like are you serious right now???? She then says ...well if you are not gonna order can you step aside so I can take the next order. What ????!!!!! I ask to speak to the manager...who apparently is the girl that has been standing next to her the whole time and did not seem to think there was a problem at all. \n\nI was so outta there...I am sure the food is yummy..but it is such a shame to not only have an employee that responds this way...but to have a person in charge thinking it was normal."
1,"Flour and Barley which appears to be a hip pizzeria nestled in the center of the new linq truly was a disappointment in terms of the quality of pizza and the service provided.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant is nice and trendy.  An appeal of an \""upscale\"" eerhem \""overpriced\"" pizza place.  There is seating inside or out depending on your preference and of course availability.\n\nService was cordial initially with the hostess but when we were seated our server really wasn't all that welcoming.  Constantly approaching our table asking if we were ready when we literally picked up the menu.  I did have an issue with nuts being in the pizza and asked if I could substitute that with spinach instead.  Server asked the manager and approved of my request. \n\nThey don't provide bread but give out these measly pocky-like bread sticks. \n\nThe menu has two kinds of pizza.  White garlic based and the standard marinara.  We opted for the marinara pepperoni and spinach pizza.  The pizza was so mediocre.  Honestly the pizza tasted just like s'barros but with a $18 price tag.  I also ordered some clam appetizer with breading which came with 6 clams I believe but were so tiny. \n\nOverall, I would not return to this restaurant based on the server constantly bothering my dining experience and the poor quality of the pizza."
2,"The Monterey Pub......I want to love it, because it's in my neighborhood...but...\nIt's super loud (not a civilized eating environment), but maybe that's why it's called a pub ;-)  It's really small, limited seating, and full of local (Mexican War Streets) drunks...not social drinkers - alcoholics, ok?\nThe food is good - try the black bean quesadillas, spinach salad, and/or the grilled cheese - and the service is good.  But it's super LOUD (bad acoustics) & hard to get a table.  I usually order it to go, so I don't have to deal w/ the noise and social dynamics."
2,"We live very close to this restaurant and have been there a number of times. The sushi rolls are ok but their daily happy hour specials are a great value.\n\nWhile the food is average, their service is typically great. One female manager is particularly attentive and seems to take an interest in the guests. We've had some excellent servers too.\n\nThe food is fairly average (though MUCH better than the typical Pan Asian style restaurants in the area). It does have an urban atmosphere and is a great option for the neighborhood."
0,"I'm reviewing Marquee as a real human being. Not one of dozens of promoters who are paid to hype this place up.\n\nMarquee is the worst of what you think of when people describe Las Vegas Night clubs. Most of the bouncing and line staff are just dicks. This is the kind of place who hires doormen who really get off on what little power they have in their lives.\n\nThere were crazy lines, prices on tables switched every 15 minutes, and my group got the run around - you know the usual \""oh you've got to talk to so and so\"" and \""I don't think she's working tonight b.s.\"" Whatevs, it's Vegas, I understand that it is douche bag mecca.\n\nThe real problem came once my friends and I actually got inside. I figured after all of the b.s. and the runaround and the big fucking deal the doormen were making this place HAD to be the shit. \n\nWe get inside, fight our way to the dance floor (which also had separate bouncers keeping people off of it - yup, you read that right even after getting into the club there are bouncers waiting to keep you off of the dance floor) and I am shocked to see the overflowing sausage fest spilling out of the dance floor.\n\nAfter all the exclusivity pretense - trust me I live in L.A. I'm used to that bullshit - I finally get into the place and it is 70% dudes - busted dudes at that - on the dance floor, awkwardly grinding on each other, leering at the one or two unattached women on the floor. I left 1 Oak for this shit! Are you serious?\n\nI had been hearing all this garbage about Marquee being the number one rated nightclub and blah blah blah. I guess folks in Las Vegas buy that shit because there were plenty of people lined up to shell out their cash in this bullshit, promoter-created, artificial club. \n\nI went to XS literally the night before. It was not even comparable. At XS on a random Monday night in March, Lil John was DJ-ing, the crowd was hype as shit, and there was absolutely no bullshit. When I next go to Vegas I will be skipping this douche factory."
2,"Avec la popularit\u00e9 fulgurante de ce restaurant, je m'attendais aux meilleures soupes du monde. J'en ai essay\u00e9 2, elles \u00e9taient bonnes, mais pas \u00e0 ce lancer sur les murs. Ce qui est int\u00e9ressant, c'est qu'elles sont disponibles en 3 formats diff\u00e9rents. \n\nPour ce qui est des sandwichs, il est possible d'en prendre un complet ou un demi. Encore une fois, c'est bon, mais je me fais de meilleurs sandwichs \u00e0 la maison. \n\nJ'adore le d\u00e9cor. Chacun des 6 restaurants Soupe Soup a un d\u00e9cor diff\u00e9rent. Celui de la rue Duluth est tr\u00e8s rustique et chaleureux. Des murs en bois d\u00e9cor\u00e9s de tableaux d'ardoise sur lesquels sont inscrits les menus. Des tables en bois ou en c\u00e9ramiques color\u00e9es. C'est mignon."
2,"City Centre Cafe is pretty much your standard sandwich shop.  There's nothing particularly amazing about the food and there's nothing particularly awful.  Like most sandwich restaurants, they use preservative-laden cold meats, which in my opinion, make it impossible to enjoy a turkey or roast beef sandwich.  However, the hot sandwiches are decent.  \n\nBasically, it's a grab n' go type place catering to the downtown legal industry.  And the people working there are really nice and the customer service is excellent."
3,"What can I say a Vegas nightclub in one of my favorite Vegas strip hotels. The line does move fast, beautiful people and decor. I love the openess of this club being from Chicago. You get a great view of the night sky while dancing. The music was great too kept everyone moving. Will be returning ;)"
1,"I was really looking forward to trying this place out but I left disappointed.  Ordered pizza and pasta and all anyone could taste was chili pepper.  Spaghetti and meat sauce?  Chili pepper.  Baked pasta and cheese?  Chili pepper.\n\nThe cheese pizza was cold and bland.\n\nThe one positive was the tzatziki dip.  Now that was good.  I'd definitely order that again.\n\nThe restaurant itself was also pretty warm inside.  And frankly, the food was entirely too expensive for what was served."
0,"I would rather eat dog food that has been left in the hot desert sun for a month. Their \""cheese\"" amounts to moist paste with a dash of flavor. There is nothing special about this place aside from the quaint old cowboy feel. I would rather starve then spend my money here again. The best thing I consumed there was my beer. Do not believe the hype it cafeteria hot plate food with western names. Awful."
3,"I am thrilled Olive & Ivy is in the airport.  Delicious breakfasts, friendly staff, and good coffee drinks.  Beats the hell out of Burger King.  That stuff will kill ya."
1,"I came in here with 3 girlfriends to have dinner and drinks to catch up. After ordering several dinners, drinks, and appetizers our service drastically changed. We attempted to order several different bottles of wine, but because they were I'm between menus, they were out of everything we asked for. We then asked to buy a bottle of their fall wine from the manager, Alex. He completely ignored out request and didn't even bother to come back to our table for 30 minutes. He didn't apologize, just told us to Come back tomorrow night.  We have all been here at least 5 times and none of us will be making it back after tonight. The one positive was our waiter, G. He attempted to be helpful anywhere he could."
2,"Good NY style pizza.  A great value at the Cosmo, open late I think til 3 or 4 am.  Line gets long later in the night or early in the morn I should say.  Not amazing pizza but really good especially after hours of drinking.  Cheap drinks and wine as well."
4,"So we decided to go here our last day at the cosmopolitan before heading back down to LA, and i have to say, it was a very good decision.\n\nService:\nexcellent.  our waiter was always around while we were looking through the menu to give us suggestions and answer any questions and was very knowledgeable of the menu.  drinks were always full and extra sauce was brought out fast\n\nAtmosphere:\na little casual and kicked back feeling, but still a little more fancy than most casual places just due to how it felt in the restaurant probably because of the lighting and the layout\n\nFood:  (the most important part, right?)\nI will start out by saying that if you have ever been to Unami, it is very much like that, but i felt it was even better.  I got the gold standard burger, and it was very good.  the patty had that great fluffy texture and not super packed like at most burger places which made it extra juicy.  the tomato mix they put on it made it very much like bruschetta and was a nice change from just a plain old tomato.  the arugula on it added a nice bitter taste to contrast with the tomato and meat, along  with the bite from the goat cheese cheddar that they put on.  just to throw it out there, the goat cheese threw me for a loop because i am used to goat cheese being very soft like it usually is, but the goat cheese cheddar on the burger was a pretty hard texture, almost like a parmesan but it still had that amazing goat cheese taste.  the bun was to me a standard type bun that you would expect at a gourmet burger place, but it was toasted just right and soaked up the juice from the burger patty very well.  I also got an order of the shoestring fries which were seasoned perfectly that i didn't even bother asking for anything to do them in (i usually dip my fries in blue cheese dressing).  the fries were very crispy since they were pretty thin, but salted perfectly and there was a decent sized portion of them also.\n\nthe only thing that wasn't super awesome to me was the prices (i believe the gold standard was around $17) but for typical vegas prices, it isn't too bad.  and considering it was bigger and better than unami for around the same price, it isn't that big of a deal.  I will return again to try something different off the menu."
2,"Settled on this place after touring around the city because we happened upon it when we were hungry and thirsty. All the other places in this center looked a little too commercial or noisy.\n\nBar Louie is a nice place. The music was a little loud inside but we sat out on the patio which offers a brilliant view of downtown. The food was actually pretty good for what is mostly a bar/club. \n\nI would have given this place one more star except that the service was a bit slow. Not bad, just annoyingly slow. Also, the bathroom has an attendant. This is just one of those things that really irks me in places like this. Because some guy has blocked the paper towels I have to tip him when he hands them to me. And no, I don't want to be prayed with cologne. Lame.\n\nIf you can get a patio seat and avoid tipping somebody on restroom trips, this place is pretty cool."
3,"After visiting Vegas almost a dozen times I finally wandered my way over to Old Vegas, and specifically the Golden Nugget. I had low expectations of this place given the glitz and glamor of the strip. The hotel lobby and casino felt classy and cool. I can't speak to what the rooms looked like. I did make a quick stop by their pool, no hassles (and no room key) I just walked right in. It was so cool, they had a water slide that turned transparent as it goes through a shark tank filled with real sharks, you have to see it to believe it."
2,"Nice patio and good service.  I had the Phoenix burger with truffle fries - both tasty.  I was there for happy hour and told that happy hour only applied to the bar & patio, so I opted for the patio even though I was one of a handful of people there in the middle of the day.  I enjoyed my visit, but wouldn't say it was spectacular.  If I am in the area, I will stop in again."
4,"I went here to get a dozen roses for my 5 year anniversary: 7 red, 5 white. It was one of the most beautiful bunch I have ever bought. And! And, when I picked them up, the arrangements and other items in the store were equally beautiful and well put together. Go here before anywhere else in Madison. I've tried 4-5 locations and this is tops."
3,"Pleasantly surprised!\n\nI came here expecting an Olive Garden experience, which is to say I was not expecting much. I am happy to report that I really enjoyed the two times I have been. I would recommend this place to a friend and will definitely dine here again.\n\nPros:\nFast, friendly, helpful service\nGreat bread\nReasonable prices\nWide selection of appetizers & entrees\nFull bar\nVery clean\n\nCons:\nNo lasagna! (or other baked dishes)"
1,"Service was surprisingly faster then the last couple reviews. Maybe because there was only one other party dining in also? Service wasn't as friendly, why act like smiling hurts? I ordered the eggs benedict served with hash browns. Nothing to brag about. Don't think it was worth the $8.99 price. The hash browns were good, especially served with onions. The hollandaise sauce isnt as \""rich\"" as they advertised. My daughter had the classic French toast. That wasn't worth  $8 either. The scrambled eggs and bacon that came with it was good and tasty but the french toast was so bland and tasteless, my daughter wouldn't touch it. All in all, the $18.90 bill wasn't worth the $5 tasting food..... I give 2 stars for fast service."
0,"I've had the worst experience at this Wendy's.  I could do a long rant but I'll make this short.\n\n1) My 5 year old was served a RAW cheeseburger.  They walked this cow right through the damn kitchen.\n2) Only one employee seemed to speak enough English for me to attempt to complain.\n3) The ONLY thing I was given in compensation was a free kiddie frosty.  The manager (wherever they were hiding) didn't even come out to apologize.\n\nThe employees were too busy doing a chant for Obama than to worry about actually doing there jobs.  While I don't care who they wanted for president, it's a bit disturbing that this was okay with management.\n\nIf my son gets sick, I promise you that compensation will not be just a frosty.  I've worked near here for over 10 years and it used to be good but it has really gone downhill over the years."
3,"We eat here often, but lately the drive-thru is understaffed and it takes a while to get thru."
0,"Awful for lunch.... essentially a half-step away from cafeteria food.  Selections were sparse, and what was out was lukewarm at best.  No carving station, and no fresh fruit except for some apples and unripe bananas.  The only thing that saved it at all was the dessert station...  and that was just because it was in comparison to the sub-par food around it.  Yes, you can eat all you want for around $17... but if the food is so bad you don't want to eat it, it's not much of a bargain!"
1,"We ate here due to the good reviews on Yelp.  However, we were very disappointed.\n\nWhen we sat down we noticed that the table was dirty.  We mentioned this to the server and got some strange answer about how people don't use the tables.  No idea what she was trying to say (she spoke very good english).  My wife got some napkins and washed the table herself.  The server didn't even apologize.\n\nWe ordered the asian chicken salad and won ton soup for appetizers.  For the main dishes we ordered Chicken and broccoli and pan fried noodles with beef.\n\nThe chicken salad didn't come as described on the menu.  It had maraschino cherries  instead of dried cranberries.  There were no nuts on the salad and the dressing had no taste (supposed to be an asian vinaigrette)  and there was no sesame oil.  If they were out of so many things, they should have told us when we ordered it.  The salad just tasted like lettuce with very little other flavor. \n\nThe won ton soup also had no flavor.  The broth tasted like boiled water and the vegetables and dumplings added nothing to the soup.\n\nLikewise, the 2 main dishes were OK, but lacked any real flavor. I added soy sauce (which I never do) so that it would taste like something.\n\nWe tried to explain these problems to the server, but got nowhere.  She didn't even say she was sorry for the poor food.  She really needs to learn how to be a server at a restaurant.  She needs to carry customer comments to the kitchen and apologize to the customer that they weren't happy.\n\nVery poor experience. We will never return and I hope others read this and go elsewhere."
3,"I came in for an underarm wax because I was going on vacation and didn't want to be bothered with shaving.  I must say I was very nervous and a little hesitant because no one I knew had ever had this done before (and I asked EVERYONE).  I called ahead to make sure they offered the service and the man told me they closed at 7 but I could come anyway (it was 6:45).  When I got there I waited about 10 minutes as everyone was still working on someone else.  The waxing is done in a separate room and is kept clean.  The actual waxing for each arm was done about 5 or so times to make sure all of the hair was gone.  It was actually pretty painless- it hurt less than my eyebrows which I have done regularly.  The after effects weren't too bad and I felt back to normal within a day or two.  I remained hair free for about 5 days but after that I did need to do some touch up shaving, which I blame on myself because I only let my hair grow for about 4 days before getting waxed.  Ideally, I should have waited about a week.\nThe outside is a little run-down but the inside is very serene and peaceful, which is something I want during my mani-pedi time. Staff was very friendly and happy to oblige.  Wait time didn't seem too bad but they definitely seem to be busy after 5 and on the weekends.  I only gave 4 stars because I haven't had their primary services- nails- but because of my great experience with waxing, I will definitely be back to try out their feet and hand services. :)"
3,Wife and I had a really nice time here a few Saturday's ago. Went kinda late but there was still a few people enjoying food and drinks. I see some people had issues with the service but for us it was fantastic. We actually sat at the bar and only really interacted with the bartender. I believe his name was Jason and he was great. We had no idea what to get but luckily he walked us through the menu and recommended some things that we ended up ordering and everything was very good. The fish was super fresh and the rolls were delicious (can't remember exactly what we had). The atmosphere was really cool and it's great we have a couple places like this now in north east Mesa to eat and have a couple drinks.
3,"Stopped in for a few items while waiting for my to-go order from Hiro's Sushi across the street. Talk about a liquor selection! WOW! I didn't even come in for alcohol or buy any, but I couldn't help be amazed by the selection. For a grocery store, this place could battle BevMo! Kinda pricey prices, but clean market with friendly smiles and service."
4,"I have finally had this one of kind pizza, the wait long after many attempts I finally made in the door.  I do say it was delicious, and more than amazing. I love olives and they did not disappoint in the menu selections. Recommend the place, regardless the bumper car crowd.  Over A pluss."
3,"I love Cafe Rio! My favorite is the shredded chicken salad with pinto beans. I always order an extra creamy dressing, it's amazing! I'm really glad cafe rio's in Arizona! Yay!\n\nFood 5/5\nAtmosphere 5/5- this place is really open, parking is great, and there's never a wait!\nService 5/5"
2,"I am really in two minds about this place, a second visit will be needed, by then I hope they have the place running smoothly AND they take notice of a couple of reviews on here, mine and CF would be a good start.\n\nWe showed up early, just after 5, as the only customers in the place I was happy to be greeted and sat immediately.\n\nThe menu is ok, no where near as extensive as some Tapas places I have been to, but there should be a couple of dishes for everyone\n\nThe drinks, yep I have to agree here with CF, taking a thin glass, filling it with ice, then adding a very small amount of liquid isn't the way to go, design over use strikes again, you can get away with that if you are serving premium drinks, but these are not premium.\n\nI really need to get this out of the way now, this place screams of an owner thinking about what he likes rather than what his desired customers would like. The seating looks good, but in reality isn't that comfortable and the music choice...Where do I begin, ok, they are aiming for a hip crowd, fair enough, but hip crowds also have kids, gangsta rap really isn't the best idea in the world, to be playing in a restaurant at 5pm, I personally can just block it out, but with the demographic of the area (predominantly older) yeah they may have issues....I totally get that a restaurant should be an extension of the owner/chef, but a neighborhood tapas place isn't the right venue....Anyways food for thought.\n\nOn to the important stuff, the food. :\n\nThere are some very good dishes, then there are some that I really just wanted to run in the kitchen, grab one of the iron skillets and smack the chef upside the head, just so I could get a clear picture of what he was thinking.\n\nThe sticky bun tacos, very nice, the pork belly pieces could have been a bit bigger, but overall a good dish.\n\nMonte Cristo, certainly one of the gems, a great combination.\n\ngai satay, I was in two minds about this dish, I love traditional satay, this is not a traditional version, but after my second piece I decided I liked it, leaving the skin on gives it a slightly different taste and a way different texture.\n\nThe Hodgepodge....Ok, this is the dish that had me almost running to the kitchen and is the main reason this place got 3 stars instead of 4 (well ok, hearing the F bomb dropped every 10 seconds for the first 20 minutes we were there also helped, but mostly this dish).\n\nIf you are going to open a Tapas restaurant, DO NOT BUY AND SERVE products purchased from US Foods or Crisco, the potato tots I can forgive in this respect, but french fries and sweet potato fries directly from the bag, you have got to be kidding me.\n\nMake the fries fresh, it's easy to do, cheaper for the restaurant and they taste better. A way better dish would be just taking the tater tots by themselves, they tasted great, the fries tasted just like they had come from a bag, sad.\n\nFor dessert, well actually I was going to pass, but the cream cheese lote sounded good, so we decided to split it.....And there was the best dish of the night perfect texture, great taste, the only let down was the fork, it wasn't plastic, but it was one of those that are so thin, when you look at them they bend and in fact, ours did bend, yes a crepe (call it Thai flat bread if you like it isn't, but whatever) bent two forks....\n\nThis place has potential, but it needs a reality check or it won't be around long, the staff are pleasant, the service quick and friendly, this could be a great place with just a little thought put into it."
4,"The first time I went to the cupcakery was about a year ago when the place where I would have my cell phone repeatedly fixed was right next door. Due to lack of service one time, the cellphone store gave me some business cards for the cupcakery  that enabled me to get free cupcakes. One cupcake was all it took to get me hooked. Now, whenever I am in the area, I stop by and get a cupcake, I don't care how much of a hurry I am in. Every single one has been a pleasure. In fact, I have a friend who flies in every few months and we must go to Red Robin as that is his favorite place and there are none close by where he lives. This time, I took him to the Cupcakery which is right across the parking lot after his Red Robin meal and all he did for the next three days was rant and rave about his cupcake and how good it was. So now we have another Cupcakery addict.  Yes, $3.95 is a lot to spend on a cupcake. But I don't care if it's quality. The ingredients, the balance between them all, the icing on the top, the presentation, it is all perfection. Each time I have been in there either one or two gentlemen have waited on me promptly, and they are always friendly, cheerful and very helpful when it comes down to narrowing down the many choices.  Give it a try!"
3,"Went to this place when I was in Charlotte for the weekend. This place is really cool. I little hard to find - it's in the back of a strip mall - and I went in the wrong door. They have a small area for classes and that's the door I ended up going through. \n\nOverall a very nice shop. The staff were friendly but not pushy and they have a great selection of yarns and accessories. Very well organized, which is nice when you are browsing."
1,"Had a burrito, but it wasn't very good.  The first half of it tasted like all beans.  The 2nd half was better, but still left a lot to be desired.  I was really hoping I'd like this place because it's so close, but I don't think I'll be back.\n\nWhen I went, the place was packed full, but I was still served quickly.  Friendly staff."
0,"In addition to the bizarre behavior outlined in my previous review, the owner eventually found our group's website and began harassing members and the group at large on our forums.  She also made direct statements to multiple members indicating she does not wish to have LGBT persons in her store, despite the Willy Street location. The extreme level of unprofessionalism is unbelievable. Please look for another place to find your yarn - you will be treated better and have better yarn to select from."
4,My favorite burger place near my home. Working my way up to the crazy huge burger challenge. And yes the onion rings are the best ever!
1,"The pizza is pretty good, but the crust is pretty bad unless you get Cajun.\nThey used to add a lot of seasoning to the crust, and it was very flavorful. \n\nOne of the employee's explained to me that they now are forced to use less flavor on the crust though, which is a huge downer for me.\n\nWhen I pay extra for extra flavoring on my crust however, it comes with the same amount, and I'm paying extra for no reason.  \n\nAdditionally the last 2 times I've been there, they got my order wrong."
3,"I finally found it by calling for directions since the Yelp directions are wrong, although the address listed is correct. I will be back - everything on the menu looks tasty and the veggie burger and West Coast Wrap were both delicious. \n\nThis is a wonderful vegan/vegetarian/healthy option in Charlotte's repertoire."
3,"Siu wok is a clean, fast, and decent chinese take out option for cenpho foodies.\nI still havent found truly authentic and amazing Chinese food in Az. but this is about as good as a chinese-american take out place you could ask for. \nThey have some really great deals as far as lunch options and combo meals are considered, and their wait staff is attentive and subservient to say the least. \nI would say that this is really an 3 star \""A-Ok\"" type of joint, but the clean atmosphere, cheap prices, and portion size here really bumped it up another star. It's always hard to rate Az chinese restaurants, as I feel like that isnt something that we do so well down in the SW, as compared to the NW or cali, so maybe my rating is a little askew. However I will say this: be you in central Phoenix one night, and if you feel like some comforting chinese take out that isnt overly greasy, than Siu Wok is a perfectly viable option.\nThe Lo-Mein, cold, straight outta the fridge the next morning is a wonderful breakfast."
1,"My friend and I went to the new Steak 'n Shake tonight. His friends raved about it so we decided to check it out. We were pretty disappointed. The burgers and fries taste like what you'd find at any other fast food restaurant but the other places are a lot cheaper. The milkshakes left a lot to be desired.\n\nSo we came, we tried, and we won't be back again."
4,"I was pleasantly surprised by my lunch at the newly renovated \""sit down\"" side of Pane Bianco. I had been to the \""to go\"" side before but wasn't all that impressed by either the service or the food, but this time I was blown away by the simplicity and elegance of the place. Our mozzarella tomato & basil sandwiches were divine, they left us feeling light and airy, not bloated or stuffy. Very gourmet, high quality stuff here. The bread is to die for. \nThe surroundings are rustic and chic, yet you don't have to dress any certain way to dine here, which I like because it takes the pressure off and you can just relax. I saw many families dining here, as well as couples like my husband and I. Would highly recommend!"
0,"This credit bank is a scam based pariah!  First I received an unsolicited credit card in the mail.  I chose NOT to \""activate\"" because I did NOT apply.  After one week, I received BILL for $75.00 as an annual fee!  When I called this \""bank\"" to state this information and asked for PROOF of an application, I was promptly disconnected.  BEWARE!  This is possibly aimed at the elderly who would not notice details but would rather simply pay."
4,"Another year & a half, another zillion 1-Star reviews for OnTrac!     :-O\n\nI receive packages from them all the time, including today, & all I get is great service from friendly drivers who porch my package if I'm not home.  Also, today's delivery was a day ahead of schedule!\n\n5 Stars again for OnTrac.  Sorry everybody, I still think they're great!     :-))"
1,"Service was fine. Nothing went horribly wrong, we paid him money and he brought us food and drinks. A little slow and we didnt leave raving about the waiter but he served his purpose I guess. Still for 60 tip you expect to want to come back.\nThe food is where I was sad. I canceled reservations at le cirque to come here and it wasnt memorable. After learning that the tasting menu was going to take too long (had a show to get to) I chose the tartar and the kampachi. The amuse bouche was FANTASTIC and had us all excited. The tartar neither of us finished and didnt find it to have a memorable signature  to make that particular dish unique to this chef. Again the waiter didnt ask why we didnt finish, he was too busy. Next was dinner. The smokey sauce on the kampachi is SO STRONG. Im sorry but that only belongs on a tasting menu. I probably ate 1/3 of the dish and was sick of it. I would say it was \""just me\"" but my girlfriend poked around at her pork and didnt like it and my husband said his steak was \""okay\"" but not worth $50. Again the waiter didnt ask about sending full plates back to the kitchen. Didnt have time for dessert bc the service was slowish. Should have done j&gs or gone to another of the big restaurants."
1,"Decided to finally try this chicken place. First off, liked the clean setting almost sterile which is a far cry from most chicken joints. Ordered the \""chick combo\"" for $7.75...3 tenders, garlic seasoned (garlic powder, NOT fresh garlic) and a can of soda (no ice available). Chicken tenders were light & crispy with a panko bread crumb like crust but a little too greasy yet well seasoned. Garlic fries were ok, would be better with real garlic. Jalape\u00f1o ranch was nice but portion was small. Hard to enjoy the meal without an ice cold drink since they have no soda fountain and the cooler full of soda cans and orange juice was not as cold as it should have been. The value is definitely not there with the nearby Chicken Shack offering better food for less money and free refills on fountain drinks. C&B charges $1.50 for a slightly cool can of soda, plus $1.00 per refill. It's clear this place struggles and passes along the costs to their customers. I wouldn't be surprised if they close their doors soon.\nI would not come back again but wanted to scratch off this place on my quest for good chicken. Next!"
2,"This was a fun experience and we enjoyed sitting on the patio. The service was horrendous which contributes to the long wait times.  The food was ok, however, wasn't fabulous for the price. Drinks were expensive as well."
4,"This is the first place in Pittsburgh that has gotten my hair right. They were courteous, up front about their pricing structure, the location extremely convenient. The elevator up is a little sketchy, but the inside the salon is lovely. I am scheduling my second appointment right now!"
2,"My husband and I love steakhouses and of course this was one of the hot spots that we had to try. I had a couple of people recommend this restaurant and I was so excited to try it out when we got to Vegas. The decor is lux and beautiful. Very elegant but not too much. Low lighting created a great romantic atmosphere. Especially the booming of the water fountains at Bellagio.What great entertainment. \n\nWell with all the ambiance I was drooling for what more has to come. The service was great, staff was very nice but it wasn't outstanding for an expensive restaurant especially for Vegas. The bread and butter was nothing to rave about. So come on steak! I'm a Rib Eye fan and always order it so then I can do a fair comparison for the quality and taste of the steak. When the steak had arrived, I dived into it and kept on cutting and cutting. Well it wasn't as buttery as I hoped. The fat on it didn't taste that great. And the meat itself was okay. Don't get me wrong. I did eat a majority of it with the three accompanying sides. 2 out of 3 were good. The mushrooms I would not recommend but the potatoes with the bacon marmalade was very good. My husband didn't think his steak was amazing either but we loved seeing the fountains. \n\nWould I recommend this place? No not really. There are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas this one was not one of them. It wasn't that it was bad but it was just disappointing. The one steakhouse that was unforgettable is STEAK from Gordan Ramsey at the Paris. That place I give 5 stars."
3,"out of all the cafes in this town, this was one of the best but also one of the priciest. had a very good new york steak here for 22 and the chicken Marsala was very good too. the apps, we had a southwest egg roll that was surprisingly spicy and  good, i like it hot too.\nall in all i would spend that much on something else where, but i did enjoy the meal."
2,"It was late....I was tired...the flight in from Dallas was kinda bumpy and long, but the thought of some non Tex-Mex mexican food brought me and a couple of friends to La Fonda. It's a small joint located at the end of a small strip mall area. One of my compadres, Ray, is a regular and the hostess greeted us warmly and joked with Ray as she walked us to our table.\n\nLa Fonda's looks functional and minimalistic. There are no velvet paintings of bull fighters or senoritas with way too much eye makeup in here, but then again, velvet paintings are overrated. \n\nThe chips were huge. The chips were hot. The chips totally rocked. I am not a huge salsa fan, but found their particular mix to be notably tasty. I ordered the Martguerita Chicken and while the portions of chicken were large, it was a bit on the dry side. The rice and beans that accompanied it were good, but not great. The impressive dish was the Supreme Nachos that Ray ordered. The plate was almost as big as he was and the goodies had to have weighed at least five pounds. Not surprisingly, he ate the WHOLE thing. \n\nOverall, La Fonda's delivered decent food at a decent price; however, our waitress (who apparently was the owner's daughter) appeared to have never waited on tables before. No drink refills without having to ask multiple times; no chip refills (another waitress got those for us); did not clear the dishes, and in general was just not good waitress material. Perhaps they were short staffed that night and she was drafted unwillingly into the position. Whatever the reason, it was a detriment to the meal. I do have to throw out a caveat here - the other waitresses seemed very attentive, friendly and professional as they bustled around the restaurant. It appears that we just happened to draw the short stick that night."
0,"It's a good concept but they don't know how to run it. They had me pick my seat before hand . Then when I got inside . Someone was in my seat. The usher told me to wait and just left . So I had to sit somewhere else . Then someone got mad that I was in their seat...  Then the fire alarm went off. The movie stopped and they said we could get concessions .. Definitely not pleased. I wanted a refund and they didnt Give Me one. My movie was ruined . \nEven though you're going for the seats and alcohol. For me , it doesn't overrule good customer service . \nNever again. I'll just go back to sams town where it's clean. Friendly and the management is ran well"
4,This place is amazing! BEST chicken tacos and guacamole!
2,"VEGETARIAN Perspective**\n\nSo upon seeing a very cool show called \""Recycled Percussion\"" my friend Alida (shout out) and I decided to get some grub. \nIt was her pick; so 'tis ALL her fault! ....haha, kidding.\n\nPROs:\n\nGreat parking space\nEasy to find directionally\nFriendly service\nCheap (I'll take quality over price any day)\nBeautiful ambiance\nSeat yourself vibe with casual attire\netc...\n\nNEG:\n\n...has to do with showing up with an empty stomach (but open mind) and thinking, \""It's Ramen. I LOVE ramen. NOT a vegan so there's bound to be something\"".... Alida was kind enough to initiate the question of, \""What do you have for veg's? Response- \""NOTHING! nothing for vegetarian\""\n\nI do highly appreciate that the waitress knew her menu and communicated that to me honestly. Upon an awkward \""Shall we leave...?\"" look, she offered to have a dish of fried rice + egg NO pork custom made and it was *delicious*... just sucked being hungry. \n\n\nBUT HEY, it was a good meal, reasonably priced, Alida enjoyed her dish AND she is not allowed to choose the next restaurant ;-) HA!"
2,"I think I have discovered the reason for those wildly differing reviews - there are two towers you can stay in at the Tropicana. The Island Tower seems to be the one where rats are snapping at your feet while you're killing cockroaches with your shoe, BUT: the Paradise Tower is old, but solid.\n\nI got booked into the Paradise Tower for a business trip this week. First I was horrified after reading all the reviews here, but I have to agree with the more reasonable ones: Yes, the hotel is kinda old, the towels are thin, but the room was clean, did not smell, the A/C worked and the beds were firm - and that coming from someone who bought his own bed at IKEA because he can't stand the soft American beds. I took a picture and uploaded it, just in case you don't believe me or think that all those fumes alledgedly coming out of the vents made me go nuts. Bottom line: If you just sleep there, it's alright. IF you are in the Paradise Tower, see above.\n\nResort wise, I didn't check out any of the food, drink or show places - we walked five minutes over to the Excalibur for a regular Starbucks experience in the morning and would crash at bars all over the place, like the Planet Hollywood or Mandalay Bay (both in walking distance). If you want to pimp it, grab a cab for the Wynn, but don't forget those leather shoes."
2,"I LOVE CRAFT restaurant. I was staying at MGM this past weekend, and after laying out at pool to detox after a long saturday night, I walked into 'wichcraft seeing Tom Colicchio name on window. Tom Colicchio's Craft in LA is great, so I had high expectation from this casual sandwich shop however it was just mere ehhhh okay. The tuna panini was sour~ and I didn't care for it too much, but I was really hungry since I haven't eaten all day till 4pm. Hmmmm maybe next time."
3,"Service: Standard, nothing to write home about.\nDecor: Romantic, dark and rustic\nCuisine: Large portions, big enough to split with partner. \nWine: Nice selection. I adored Uppercut.\nSpirits: Well-made.  An oops on my husband's after dinner drink, the bartender actually caught upon service though.\nEntertainment: I love anywhere with live music and could careless how good they are if they have a good vibe! Cheers!"
3,"Many good restaurants are closed on Mondays, but Les Deux Gamins has their doors open with friendly, welcoming service and simple but good food.  Basic French options, with great service with good timing of plates.  I had the fois gras appetizer and the salmon tartare - both perfectly composed.  \n\nNothing super-amazing, but very pleasant and reasonably priced."
1,"I will say the customer service here was great and the older man behind the counter was very generous with samples. I sampled the vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. The consistency was different from any custard I have ever had and not in a good way. It had the consistency of cool whip and all the flavors tasted unnatural. The strawberry flavor in particular tasted like it was made with strawberry syrup. I am disappointed in the low quality of custard served here."
4,The sin city burger was AWESOME! And the chili cheese fries tasted way better than they looked. Decent prices & nice atmosphere. I definitely recommend this place!
4,"What can I say. It was quite simply just an amazing culinary experience, the best Japanese dishes I have ever tasted.\n\nSmall restaurant space but cozy, cultural and unique. (It's what I would expect in Tokyo) The staff are extremely friendly and the chefs work at god speed. The dishes are not expensive at all for both the quantity and especially the quality, the usual individual bowls and dishes are about $15-20 each. We decided to try just about everything we were interested in on the menu, and ended up spending about $40-$50 per person. The uniqueness of the dishes is hard to find elsewhere in North America. The 1 hour of waiting on hungry stomach while blocking sidewalk traffic on the street? WELL worth it. I would have waited for another 2 hours if need be.\n\nThe ambiance of this place may not be ideal for a date who expects the sophistication of fine dining. But have been raised in China, I love this tiny place where people can sit side by side and watch the chefs work their magic and truly experience the amazing dishes with the culture. Doodles of the menu items are scattered across the walls of the restaurant, quite sweet and special. \n\nTuna Belly - This is got to be the best fish I have ever tasted. With a price tag of $35, you get a gigantic dish that's cooked to beyond perfection. The meat is tender and the texture is so soft that it melts in your mouth, the fresh taste of the tuna meat is not lost in this perfectly flavored dish. We found ourselves flipping the fish over and over many times to try to find anything that's left to eat.\n\nShrimp Burger - I ordered this for my main dish. It's definitely the most unique thing I have tasted, chunks of shrimp is pressed into a burger patty, lightly seasoned, sitting in between two lightly grilled buns topped with fresh lettuce leafs and tomato slices, as well as an extra hint of crispy from rice crispies. Light and fresh, without the usual greasiness associated with burgers, special and excellent.\n\nTuna Tartare and Salmon Tuna Bowl - Both dishes contain raw fish, high grade salmon and tuna sliced into small chunks, paired with seasoned sticky rice and veggies. There was no extra taste of 'seafood' in the dish at all for those who doesn't fancy raw fish for that reason.\n\nGrilled Shrimp - This is probably among one of the heaviest thing we ordered - flavor wise, and it didn't taste heavy or greasy at all. Three extra large shrimps plated with tomato, sesame seeds, sitting in a special grill marinate. The shrimp's flavor is so intense and concentrated it's quite amazing, the grilling is done to a perfect level - you could taste the extra flavor coming from the grilling alone.\n\nGyoza - 4 gyozas pan fried and plated carefully as an appetizer, with the perfect proportion of meat (inside) to dough (outside). The grilled bottom thin and crispy, the sides thin and soft, and the inside juicy and tender. \n\nMatcha Ice Cream - Homemade ice cream with matcha powder on top. Heavenly! The bitter taste of matcha combined with the slightly sweet ice cream. Almost make you want to lick the little ice cream teacup.\n\nWe ordered various other dishes and it's not an exaggeration to say that everything was cooked to exact perfection.\n\nKazu really gets it, the true meaning of perfection and has earned its special place in this food-enthusiast's heart."
0,This restaurant had the worst food I've ever eaten in Vegas.\n\nNot sure if other reviewers of this place are fake or too drunk to properly assess the food here.\n\nSandwiches are awful and taste like cardboard mixed with garbage with mayo on it.\n\nFresh fruit for dessert was the only thing that tasted normal.\n\nFuck!
4,"I'm a fan of my cupcake place back home in Cali but my LV friends kept raving about Retro so I finally made it into town before they closed up shop for the day.\n\nMy taste buds were happy, I'll tell ya. I should have wrote this review sooner because I don't remember the flavors I got but I know they were great. They do not sell minis unless by pre-order.\n\nI thnk it is the frosting that won me over. It's wonderful. The cake itself was above average but not mouth-watering good. I recommend highly and I will be back next time I'm in town. (two weeks) :)"
3,"A fantastic selection of meats, rubs, toppings, and sauces, this is one of the most thoroughly complete build-a-burgers I've ever seen.  The ingredients are all high quality, and they prepare the patties well more often than not.  The milkshakes--alcoholic and otherwise--are also fun and original."
3,Wow! Great show. So much packed into it. We got 50% off tickets. Great bargain
0,"*****Just stop now and sign up for internet with any other company except Centurylink*****\n\nSince May I have had subpar service with this company. I have called about 5 times to complain that I am only getting 5mb per second on all my devices. Every time I call, the person on the other end tells me that the service looks great on their end. They don't listen when I tell them that I am getting 5Mb on 3 devices and I should not have to reset the modem every two days like they tell me too. \nNo one listens to what I need and it is a bunch of lies. Today, I called to cancel and Ginger (the rep) told me that I have a 12 month commitment. Mind you that I signed up for a no-contract service. She said that I owe $20 per month for the unused months (8 months left). She said that I could only cancel within the first 30 days. I let her know that I have called 5 times about the bad service. She cannot see the notes on her end and she is not linked to notes from technical issues. How can someone in retention not be able to see the history of the account to be able to get the full picture. \nAnother lie and ploy to get you to sign up and make you pay even more when you want to cancel. \nI don't want much, I just want my devices to have more than 5Mb per second. I asked to speak to a supervisor and Ginger refused to transfer me. She said she can send an email and then hung up on me. Yes, she hung up on me. That is CenturyLink in a nutshell. Pull this call, 9/26/2014 at about 2:10pm and the rep name is Ginger. All I want is to leave. I don't want to do business with your company because you are shady and crooked. You cannot do business like this in 2014 and I will let every last human know to stay away. You cannot put NO CONTRACT on the front page of your website and then tell me I am in a 12 month \""commitment\"". \nPlease make it right. Not only for me but for future customers. \n1. Ginger cannot hang up on me even though I am an angry customer. I believe I called the retention number. Not only does she not help resolve an issue I have been having for months, she hangs up on me. She should be repremanded\n2.  Change the wording on your website to either say 12 month contract or truly allow customer to cancel anytime under your no contract. No Contract- Is a lie. it is not called a contract but it is a 12 month commitment. (how funny does that sound and is it different to you and I). I called to cancel and I will have to pay  $20 per month for the unused months left in my \""commitment\""\n2. They throttle your service. You do not have the speed that you pay for. They will slow you down to a crawl if you use your service. \n3. The modem is the cheapest. When I signed up I was told that I had to use their modem/WIFI. If you use any devices wirelessly, stay away from Centurylink. I sold my $200 WIFI with the latest technology to go with their $39 one.  The jokes on me.\n4. You will not get the service you pay for and complaining will do absolutelynothing. Don't be sold on the price they give you.\n\nAgain, I just want to leave, I am unhappy because I pay for a service that I am not getting. All I ask is for you to honor we initially agreed upon. NO CONTRACT. It is simple, COX does it, Time Warner does too. When the customer does not want the service, we just part ways."
0,"Run down, dirty, ghetto, and honestly not safe to be at alone in the day time OR night. if i shop here its my last resort, and i try to be in and out as quick as possible to make sure my car is still in the parking lot when i am finished. Workers are never happy or pleasant, nor helpful. How is this crap hole still standing?"
4,If you're downtown near McGill then this is the place to get a latte.
0,Tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold.  Will never order from here again.
1,"Restaurant:\nI DID NOT have a good experience at all. I went there on a saturday night after watching Phantom of the Opera. The waiter did not seem to have time for us. He didn't bring the bread as promised. The runners, and waiter didn't have enough time to refill our water glasses. I ordered spaghetti, and didn't expect it to be \""el dente\"". I don't like el dente. It should have at least stated that on the menu, unless by default higher end restaurants only serves el dente, then it's my fault for not knowing. I did my part to make it a perfect night for my girl friend and chose Lavo restaurant expecting them to do their part to keep it perfect. \n\nI still didn't get my freakin bread after we almost finished our dinner. I see other tables received their bread before or with their entrees. For some, their bread basket might be late late, but at least the bread came for them LOL. Basically, everyone else got theirs. So what did I do? I asked for the bread, and got it 10 minutes later, after I had one bite left with my dinner. Instead of eating it, I just left it sitting there untouched. One of the runner guys asked if I wanted the bread to go, and I just dogged him. I wanted that waiter to know that he fucked up, he wasn't paying attention, and he should learn not to redirect blame to others who are not directly responsible for his table. And to make him and his food runners do the job that they're supposed to do and provide the complimentary bread as they should to all their patrons.\n\nI wouldn't have mind if the waiter acknowledged his oversight. I would have dropped the whole bread ordeal. But he acted dumb, \""oh you didn't get it yet. But I told them to bring it out\"". Yes, we didn't get it. Had you paid attention you would have noticed that a long time ago when you walked past our table a few times before our entr\u00e9es came out.\n\nI used to wait tables at a high end Japanese restaurant, and that line was complete BS.\n\nOh, the Chicken ravioli wasn't bad.\n\nNightclub:\nSucked.\n\nI should have stuck with my original plan to dine at Tao restaurant and attend Tao nightclub. But I've been there many times already and thus, I wanted to try out Lavo. Big Mistake.\n\nHowever, the Palazzo is still one of my favorite hotels to stay at. I'll just never dine or attend Lavo Restaurant/Nightclub again."
4,"Excellent Sushi ! \n Spent the weekend in Montreal, and decided to give this place a try; we were not disappointed. \n The staff was friendly and knowledgable, and the food was fantastic. I actually felt bad eating it, because it was so expertly displayed. \n The Anaconda Roll and Spicy Tuna Tempura are must haves !"
2,"I love the clearance section at this store!  Mentos $.29 , Trident $.69, Plenty of AZ team spirit wear! The store is clean and well organized. Free WiFi, leather sofas, flat screen tv, refreshment area, and a few table and chairs.\n\nThe only reason they don't get 5 stars is because they don't seem to have the ability to handle large quantity purchases 10+ of the same item...they have to ring each separately by hand...tick tick tick ...time is money... MY money.\n\nYou will find a few homeless people begging outside on most days that you go to this location."
0,"Unless you're below the age of 10 (or are traveling with kids), you will not enjoy the Adventuredome.\n\nIt is a waste of time and money."
2,"It was as nice as a aquarium can be in the middle of the desert and inside a mall... The fish room was soothing, and the bubbles you could stick your head in were neat as well. It is a great place for kids, I just wish there as more to explore. You go once and you're pretty good for awhile. \n\nWe bought our tickets online ( for a discount.) tried to print our tickets online but they never sent them to us, and we were expecting some drama when we got there, but they said they just needed the confirmation number, thank goodness for smartphones! \n\nAfterwards we ate at Rain Forrest Cafe and I think their children's menu had some sort of deal with the aquarium as well."
2,Not a bad chinese place. They had a buffet on Sunday which looked good although I choose not to go that route. The staff was very friendly and the place looked clean. I wonder about the bar area though. How long has some of those bottles been up there? \nSesame Chicken- below average\nEgg roll - Above average
0,One lady was great.  My friend was going to just ask for a pen and all the lady did was cut us off and day she couldn't help.  I agree with everyone.   Worse service.  Even worse them the California dmv.
2,"Went here with a party of 4 on Friday night.  It was pretty busy but we had a reservation and were seated promptly.\n\nThis place serves fresh, quality food that is presented nicely and most menu items are pretty unique.  I tried a few different dishes and they were all pretty good.  However, I'm not going to say everything was phenomenal like some of the reviews on here because it wasn't.   The food is probably to hoity toity for me.  I did like my Dirty Bird Martini and the polenta though.  They were excellent.  I really really wanted the  wagyu pastrami but they only have that on certain days.  Total bummer.\n\nPro Tip #1 = When you make a reservation online and are asked to enter a reason why you are dining here, just leave it blank.  We put that we were celebrating a college graduation and of course they didn't do anything special or even mention it.\n\nPro Tip #2 = If you buy a Groupon or something like it for this place, don't give it to them until the end.  I'm pretty certain that they treat you differently because of it.  We had friendly but horrible service the entire time.  Our waitress was very attentive to every other table and every other table that arrived after us got their food before us.  Aside from waiting over an hour for our entree, our waitress ignored our table in 30 minute blocks the entire night.  However, when she did check on us she was very friendly."
0,"They have the worst customer service and organization.  Called ahead for order.  Arrived and paid for it said they would call me when ready, assuming few minutes.  Fifteen minutes later people coming in and ordering after I paid got there food.  When I could get someone's attention and asked about my order it was just sitting there.  No apologies or anything.  40 minutes even after calling ahead is bad.  This is not the first time but will be the last....."
0,"Service is rude, hassle to serve you, no thank you for order just a rude look when you pay. Food isnt good. Poor service, bathroom dirty. Food was cold and waiiter said they couldnt help. I wont come back again. China Gourmet is better on Nellis."
2,"Madison was an absolute zoo in terms of wait times for dining this past Saturday... we tried to get into three places prior to Red - all had at least an hour-and-a-half wait...  So, when the hostess offered a 30-45 minute wait, we put in our name, then walked over to The Rigby to help pass the time.\n\nThe hostess mentioned she would call us when a seat was available; after 35 minutes and no call, we walked back to Red.  The place was still quite busy - the hostess informed us it would be 10-15 minutes before she could seat us.\n\nSoon enough, two prime seats at the bar opened, and we were seated.  A hurried bartender provided glasses of water and said she'd be back to take our drink order.\n\nAfter 10 minutes or so, the bartender stopped by to say that she would take our drink orders \""in just a minute.\""  We stopped her and asked if we could put in our entire order - we knew what we wanted.\n\nShe looked frazzled, and said she'd be right back.  Within a few minutes, she returned and hurriedly took our order of two mixed drinks, edamame, and 3 rolls. \n\nWe sat for about 15 minutes; no drinks, no appetizer.  Our water glasses ran dry.  The bartender poured glasses of wine, made cocktails, and ran around the entire time.\n\nAfter 20 minutes or so, our rolls arrived.  We flagged down the bartender and inquired about our drinks and the edamae.  She said, \""Those will be out in just a minute; I've been super busy.\""\n\nI explained to her that we were hoping to have the appetizer and drinks BEFORE our meal arrived; she said something to the effect of, \""I realize that, but as you can see, I'm incredibly busy.\""  \n\nI asked her to scrap the app and the drinks; we'd have our rolls and call it a night.\n\nThe sushi itself was amazing - quite easily the best I've had while in Madison.  Far better than Muramoto and leaps-and-bounds better than Takara.  I will definitely return for sushi in the future.\n\nAs we prepared to leave, the bartender apologized for the poor timing, but it was too little, too late.  We paid our tab and left. \n\nHad it not been for the frazzled service, this would have easily been a 4.5 star experience."
2,"This was a great dinner with the friends to celebrate graduations and businesses. We had like 50 pieces of sushi and it was delicious. Tip: spicy tuna IS spicy.\n\nEverything went great, the fish is super fresh, the combinations are creative and delicious, the wine selection is really good as well but my 3 stars are for the dessert.\n\nThe moment we opened the menu all of us saw mochis and yelled with emotion, and after such a great sushi feast, mochis were the expected gran finale.\n\nSorry for us, they were really bad. We ordered mango, red bean and green tea, and the only passable ones were the green tea. Mango and red bean had crunchy shells instead of gooey and the flavor was off. \n\nI'll come back, for some great sushi with good price and a great and friendly service. But I'll never stay for dessert again."
1,"My bf and I arrived in DTPHX early for the Dbacks game so that we could grab a quick bite to eat. After realizing that our original destination, Alice Coopertown, was on the other side of the stadium, we talked by Vitamin T and decided to try it out. They have a pretty basic menu, tacos, tortas, tamales, carmelos, 2 hot dogs, and 2 salads. I was torn between a sonoran dog and tacos, but opted for the tacos.\n\nI had the chicken tacos (roasted chicken w/chipotle and lime, pickled onions, asadero cheese, and salsa verde) and my bf had the barbacoa tacos. I got a margarita, he got a beer, and we shared some chips and salsa. We had a seat on the patio and it didn't take long to get our food. #1 - If the food had been hot, I would have been significantly more satisfied, but it seems that they finish cooking  when it gets to slightly warm, which made it less satisfying. For all the items listed on the tacos (I considered asking for no pickled onions but didn't want to be difficult), you would have thought they would be bursting with flavor, but they were just alright. I will say though that the margarita was good, and the salsa they serve with their not-warm chips was also good. \n\nCan't say I'll be back."
2,"For the price its worth it but dont expect class A service.\n\nPRO's-Hotel checkin fast, casino is huge and very clean, lots of restaurants and affortable options, room was very big (widescreen rooms) clean, central ac, bathroom was very big and clean. most standards for hotels were standard here.  room service was good, cheap, fast.  pool was actually awesome. they let you bring outside drinks which is a plus, but the bar there at the pool is cheap to.  I would stay here again if it was a option due to a small budget.\n\nCON's-it's a step above circus circus because they do have a floor of arcade games and table games for kids so be prepared to see a lot of kids, especially at the pool.  hallways were very old, outside of the hotel is very old looking, and the beds were terrible, it was like sleeping on the floor.  pillows were no help either but for the price it is one of the cheaper options besides imperial palace which i wouldnt stay at imperial palace again."
4,Probably as close to the real New York as you can get here in Vegas. The highlight of this casino is the roller coaster of course. If you are a thrill seeker this is definitely the place for you!
0,"Unprofessional staff, streaked windows and mirrors. I was very disappointed with the outcome of my car wash. The interior of my car was not completely cleaned either.\nI will never go back!"
3,"I could have eaten breakfast every day at the Grand Lux!  Breakfast is served until 11am, so make sure you get there before that.  They are a bit flexible (which is good when you are up until 5am) so we tend to roll in at 10:45 or so.  \n\nI highly, highly recommend their Brioche French Toast, I think I almost passed out at the table from ecstasy.  I get the French toast with saut\u00e9ed bananas and pecans, however I suggest the caramel sauce on the side because it is SUPER sweet.  It is a huge portion and could be split easily with another person.  \n\nTheir breakfast menu is pretty reasonable being anywhere from $9-$12 for a sit down breakfast and their buffet being $16.50.  \n\nDrop in here for a good morning after full belly, you wont regret it.  It is located in the Venetian right near the Phantom Theater."
3,"Nice upscale-casual place in the heart of downtown Champaign. Their menu varies, but just tonight I tried a couple of tapas (fried mozzarella and calamari) and the mushroom ravioli. All were delicious and well presented.\n\nMy warm chocolate cake dessert, however, tasted soggy and generally unpleasant. It came with a scoop of some oddly flavored ice cream---I think it was meant to be mint, but it tasted more like horseradish. Not the best way to end a dinner; fortunately the rest of the meal was good enough to make up for it.\n\nOur server tonight did a thoroughly wonderful job. But overall service in the restaurant felt slightly slow, even on this quiet Monday night when my party was one of only two or three in the entire restaurant for a whole two hours. Halfway through our meal I noticed a middle-aged woman abruptly exit the restaurant despite pleas from her waiter. There was no commotion: it appeared the customer left, after settling down but before ordering, simply to protest the service speed.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I'd add that the men's restroom was a little worn and unkempt in the details for a restaurant of this caliber. The lock was also broken. Holistically, though, I had a great dining experience here.\n\nQuick tip to first-time diners: Free parking is kitty-corner to the restaurant in a third-party lot. Spaces numbered 1 through 30 are reserved for this restaurant's patrons."
1,Maybe it was the (far) less than stellar service. Or the rude waitstaff. Or the price. But actually it was all of this combined with the crappy food (and lack of swift replacement) and high price that made me think this is one Vegas' worst buffets.
1,"Well, the economy must be doing somewhat better because they are no longer offering the $40 all-day buffet pass.  Instead, you'll end up paying the $20/person for lunch that my group did.  This buffet has gone downhill from what it used to be.  If you, too, are looking for the lavish selection that \""Las Vegas buffets\"" brings to my mind, go to another hotel's buffet.\n\nThe best item was the fried shrimp. Prime rib was okay. And desserts, although they had a pretty good selection, tasted cheap.  Most of the bite-size portions were 90% whipped cream and 10% cake. Not worth my $20...\n\nIt's okay though, I'll just go win back my lunch monies on the roulette table."
4,"I've been a member to this gym since the beginning!\n\nIt's a great place to train and not worry about crowds of people standing around doing nothing, taking up every piece of equipment.  If you are serious about getting in shape or training hardcore, this is the gym for you!\n\nBe sure to ask for my good friend Erin, she's an awesome trainer, very knowledge about fitness and nutrition, always willing to go the extra mile for her clients. She's also a fitness competitor as well, so she practices everything she teaches, she'll get you in shape, that's a fact!"
0,Terrible customer service. Especially Irene? I won't waste my time going back again.
0,"This place was AWFUL. I was using the groupon so I had to call to make a reservation for my friend and I. As soon as I told the receptionist that I would be using the groupon, she tried to hang up on me. I told her she hadn't asked for my name yet, and she hurriedly asked what it was and hung up. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks later and big surprise, she had not written my name or my friend's name down for our reservation. Luckily, it wasn't too busy and she had my friend and I sit in her chairs. Worst mistake ever. She started off very friendly; however, I noticed after 2 coats of white gel nail polish that the color on my nails did not resemble the color that i had picked that was on the sample nail set. As soon as I told her this, she told me that the sample nails were already white and that's why the nail polish did not look the same on my nails. False advertising much? She then tried to talk me out of having white nails because it would \""look bad\"". After trying to convince her that I indeed wanted white nails, she hurriedly slapped on a few coats of white nail polish and went on to do my friend's nails. Worst quality ever. There were bubbles in my polish and a piece of random hair got stuck in the polish. She seemed very annoyed that I asked her to take the random hair out and fix my nail. \n\nWhen she asked my friend what color she wanted for her nails, my friend chose a white gel polish with sparkles, but asked the lady if the color was going to look the same as the sample (not wanting to go through the same hassle I went through). The lady responded by telling her that it was my fault that I wasn't satisfied with the color on my nails originally and that I was wrong. She then proceeded to wrap my friend's nails in foil and use the electric nail filer to take my friend's old nail polish off. She said she would have to CHARGE HER $3 FOR REMOVING HER NAIL POLISH. Her nail polish wasn't even gel or shellac, it was REGULAR NAIL POLISH for goodness sakes! As she was doing her nails, this lady kept muttering, \""Oh my God\"" underneath her breath and did the WORST JOB EVER on both of our nails. We would have just gotten up and walked out except we had already purchased our groupon. This was the worst nail experience I've ever had. DO NOT GO TO MAGEN NAIL."
4,Ordered a sausage and provolone of omelette and it was absolutely incredible my wife had muffeletta and I had to have a bite and that was amazing as well incredibly nice and excellent customer service from the staff def coming back to try everything so happy we found this place hidden gem for sure
3,I was just there a week ago and stopped in on the way home for a last run. Thin had some of the best times i have had. Great place to play. Updated casino.\n\nLove this place..
3,"Mainland was great, the food, the service, the atmosphere, everything... Which makes me kind of sad that every time I walked in here (2x) it was totally empty. I feel like this might be in part because it's in the Shops at the Palazzo, but still, that's where CUT is, and I'm sure they do just fine. Anyway, the food was excellent- I had the Mainland Ramen, which includes the basic- ramen, pork two ways, pea leaves, fish cake, hardboiled egg, bamboo, scallion, and bean sprouts. The one thing I really liked is that the pork two ways was pulled pork and definitely added to the flavor. \n\nThe second time I came here I ordered the same thing because I loved it so much but I also ordered one of their Pineapple- Guava Che, not knowing what a Che is.. Words of wisdom on this one, don't order something if you don't know what it is. This drink had everything but the kitchen sink in it- from beans, to mochi balls, to peanuts, and some guava and pineapple, who knows what else was in there though.. So besides the drink, which was drinkable- minus the beans, Mainland is amazing.  Their decor is  by Paris-based designer India Mahdavi, which is gorgeous. His design is clean, chic, and modern. This restaurant is another great addition to Jonathan Morr's collection of family style seating noodle houses and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!!"
3,"You are always pleasantly greeted when you first walk in. I really enjoy the garlic chicken pizza and my kids are fans of the pepperoni or sausage pizza (depending on the day). Staff always ask if you have any questions about baking the pizza before you leave and everything is made within minutes. Priced well, but only after using their coupons."
2,"i dont really know how to explain it, but when i was in vegas, i felt like i was living in somebody else's dream."
4,"After learning of an apparent water leak involving my water service lateral line in my front yard, I contacted Pure Plumbing based on the current excellent reviews on Yelp.  They were able to squeeze me in between their full schedule that afternoon and Andy was very professional and reasonable in his estimate to fix the problem.  I definitely appreciated his hard and quick work and the area was cleaned up as if no digging occurred!  I will definitely call them again for any future plumbing services!"
3,"Definitely a secret, this place is so well hidden in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. The door was closed when I went during the day and was kind of confused on how to even get in. Great place for a quick bite (individually sold slices). I didn't know this place was open late until walking back from Marquee one night. WIll definitely have to stop by late night during the next Vegas trip."
1,"I was craving BBQ tonight specifically brisket, so I rounded up my wife and dad. I Decided on this place, not a very good choice.. \n\nThe meat was cooked very well, it was juicy and tender. But had very little flavor.\n Not sure what this place is thinking about their homemade sauces  taste like someone just mixed a few things up so they could call it there own homemade blend. \n\nThe owner was very very nice but definitely needs to work on making new sauces or my suggestion in this case buy some store brand stuff even just to keep as an option for people (we would have taken that instead). \n\nTHE next final kicker was the portion size I got the big combo platter for $28 for my wife and I...it only came with 3 ribs, a small leg, about 3-4 slices of brisket ( barely enough to make a sandwich) , and the pulled pork was tender and juicy but barely enough to make a sandwich). \n\nSo very overpriced it was like a kiddie sampler plate at the full grown up price.\n\nPlus good thing I ate there half my order was missing. My hotel is 30 min. away imagine getting home and only having half of your baby meal!\n\nI feel bad to say this but all the great reviews here probably never have had real great BBQ. Well I will continue to search Pittsburgh for good BBQ during my 2 month stay."
1,"This is our first trip to Garbanzos.  Lets start with the good points.  The babaganoush was really good and so were the mushrooms.  That's all the good things I can say.  The taboulli tasted very bland, I don't think there was any lemon on it all all.  The steak did not taste very good, like almost every thing we tried it was under seasoned. I was hoping for new place to go but we won't be back."
1,"A lot of people really highly reccomend this Kebab House. In fact, I even had a friend who claimed he would eat one of Cappadocia's kebabs sober, they were that good.\n\nHaving come here after a night out, I wasnt suprised to find Cappadocia full of others clamouring to get a huge kebab which seems to me all they do at Cappadocia - I heard the girl in front of me being told that they had nothing else other than kebab, despite a whole list of things being advertised. \n\nWhen I did get my kebab i was hugely dissapointed - there was faaar too much sauce, even though i had specified just a little bit, and the kebab generally was so greasy after a few moments of eating it my hands felt disgusting and my mouth even more so. Now I know at this point many of you will think that all kebabs are like this, but I wish to point out that I have had much better kebabs in my student life time that came from places with far less of a reputation for quality than this, as cappadocia's kebabs seemed somewhat tastless behind the lashings of unwanted sauce.\n\nA disapointment, greasy and rather tastless."
4,"I so wish we had these out East. Every time I visit the West coast I make it a point to stop at In-N-Out, multiple times. This location seems to be just as awesome as the rest. Can't wait until our next vacation!"
0,"welcome to scamville..all I can say about this place is DO NOT plan on getting much of your deposit back. EVERY little thing gets dinged. all in all I never had any problems with the place, but was never happy with their communication or ability to help. \n\nin order to not pay knick knack fees, jump on left foot exactly this many times, then switch, then switch back. if not done exactly as described then pay up. what a pain in the a$$..\n\nnever again with PRS"
3,Very good poutine. They have many different choices of poutine to choose from and they make the food very quickly
1,"long ago, i began to fear that having worked at a seafood restaurant company had ruined me to seafood.  that is, learning (extensively) from those who reeeeally know in great detail what the difference between good quality and meh quality seafood is, i feel like i will generally be a tough critic of seafood.  i love it so much, but it is my love for it that rejects substandard stuff.  with that said:\n\nthe good:\n*  lots of selection and broken out by cuisine style\n*  clean\n*  good customer service\n*  the desserts\n*  reasonable price for a seafood buffet ($42 after tax)\n\nthe bad:\n*  the raw fish (sushi, sashimi, some of the ceviches, and oysters) was just plain poor quality.  like, C- grade seafood.  ugh, especially the tuna.  \n*  the fried fish (calamari, shrimp, catfish) was mushy.  not overfried, but like it wasn't cold enough before being put in a fryer.  weird texture.\n*  the steamed crab legs were overcooked.  crab legs are delicious, so the taste was still good, but again, the texture was bizarre.\n\nthe mediocre:\n*  everything else.  \n\nlike i said, there were a lot of things to select from at this buffet.  interestingly, the duck was really effin' good.  but, it definitely did not live up to the ranting and raving i'd heard about it.  yes, there are seemingly limitless amounts of some of the finer things in life, like lobster, crab legs, and other delicacies... but just because they are plentiful does not ensure that they are good.  that was my experience.  \n\nthe desserts were spectacular for it not being a dessert place.  i mostly highly recommend the mini strawberry shortcakes and mini chocolate cannoli."
2,"As with most places in Pittsburgh I got one hell of a Pittsburgh portion when I ordered my fish sandwich.  And my friend got the equivalent of three turkey club sandwiches in their turkey club.  So in terms of quantity of food they have things covered.\n\nI'd say my fish sandwich was borderline generic.  The fish wasnt anything special and the batter was so thick it was soft on the inside and almost underdone.  The fish was on top of a normal nondescript roll with a piece of withered warm lettuce.  The fries were very dark in color but surprisingly soft and ok flavored.  \n\nThe turkey club was so large it couldn't fit into anyones mouth.  it had to be disassembled and eaten in parts.  other than that the meat was good and moist and the bread was fresh.  There could have been more bacon to balance out the sandwich.  there must have been at least a half pound of turkey on there and only a couple strips of bacon.  The side of potato salad was average.  Not like it came out of a tub, but not like it was something terribly special either.  was a mustard style with some relish.  big chunks of potato.\n\noh, and the mozz wedges were good.  when are they not good?\n\nservice was great!  glasses never emptied.  quick and attentive.  thanks jake."
0,"This is the worst walmart ever to go to. The employees doesn't know what they're doing, can't answer any questions you ask them.  They can't even work the cash register right. The electronic section is a disgrace, they know nothing about the electronics there. I don't even Know how they got hired. Shopping carts are crappy, you'd have to go thru 5 of them before you get one that works.  That's if you can find one inside the door instead of all over the parking lot. I'd drive a little further to a different one just to not have to deal with the BS."
0,Rave motion pictures and Regal theaters are better. Why would you have $5 Movie Mondays but for only select movies and not all movies. LAME!
3,I never get tired of watching the fountains here. They tend to change up the music which is nice too.
0,"Horrible, overcooked noodles, burnt-tasting curry, watered-down drinks and the kicker: the worst service from the rudest male bartender. Never again. Just no."
4,"What a romantic little Italian place next to the Wisconsin State Capitol.   A friendly staff and a beautiful ambience contributed to one of the most romantic meals I've ever had.  The food was tasty, the portions generous, and the recipes were amazing.  A wonderful venue, this is quite a nice place to bid Arrivederci to pretty Madison."
0,"My experience this morning at dunkin was very distasteful, and by that I dont mean the donuts, I mean the service. Shaunay was vey rude and had attitude about everything I was asking him. He stood there twiddling his fingers and had no smile on his face what so ever. He didnt even say hello or good morning to me. Im really disappointed about my experience here this morning. It made me feel upset and unwelcome for my business. To be honest it kinda spoiled my morning. I dont think I will be returning to this location anytime soon."
1,"I am pretty sure Ted's has its status as a go to place here in AZ because of nostalgia. There are many places out here that are really not that great but because growing up these poor bastards had no good food are way over-rated at this point. Ted's dogs are passable, their brats are just poor. The fries are awful. The last time I went there I had to fight vomiting for a bit after, I had two hot dogs (not usually a nausea inducing amount). Thankfully there are better places popping up all the time now. Better step it up Ted's all those people who've been going here for years are gonna die and you'll be out of luck. \n\nAlso the teenage staff makes the experience no better!"
3,"Goodbye Gold Spike!\nThe sudden closure on April 13 still has people talking. I went to the closing party and the mood was upbeat, the employees were wonderful, and I appreciated being showered with freebies!\nThe bar served $1 drinks (all drinks) during the party, and though I didn't have any, a friend was impressed with the mixology happening. Drinks had to be creative as the popular brands ran out. We also had one last meal at the restaurant, which was nicely remodeled along with the rest of the property a while ago. \nAnd so continues the redevelopment of Downtown..........we shall see. \nRIP, Gold Spike."
2,"I have to admit that I had high hopes for this place. The restaurant itself is really dark inside, really dark. So we opted to eat out on the patio, which was a huge step forward in the atmosphere factor. Gorgeous water feature, great patio lighting, and nice candle lit tables. We started off with their chips and duo of salsas, which i have to admit, was very disappointing seeing that they were $2.99, where as I have had much better at places that offered them for free. Both the tomato and tomatillo salsas were just \""ehh.\""  After that I ordered the lobster enchiladas and my wife ordered the NY carne asada, only to be later informed that they were out of the lobster enchiladas. A HUGE pet peeve of mine, especially having worked as a chef for 10 years, is when a kitchen is out of something, and the front of house isn't made aware of it at the beginning of service. I digress, so I then opted for the enchilada trio of crab and filet enchiladas and the green chile mac to share. The filet enchilada and the asparagus it was served with was delicious, but twice in the crab enchiladas I bit into crab shell shards. Now I understand that crab more than likely is ordered pre-picked and cooked, not a problem. But any respectable cook should know to pick through it once over before using it to avoid situations like this. The sauces used were excellent, especially the cascabel chile sauce. The NY carne asada that my wife ordered was amazing! Beautiful crusty char on the outside, nice medium rare in the middle, simply amazing. For me,  however, the star of the night was the green chile mac. Now looks can certainly be deceiving because when it came out it looked like Kraft deluxe mac and cheese. Boy was I wrong. Creamy, not to rich, great flavor with the roasted chiles and corn tossed in, serious mac and cheese for the mac and cheese lover. I reiterate, the STAR OF THE NIGHT! Would I give Carlsbad another shot? Yeah, I like to give restaurants 2 tries before ruling them out, and they did nothing to make me cut them off completely. For the most part, food was good and the service was standard."
2,"This is one of the best BBQ places in the Charlotte area (and one of the older ones since it was originally Spoon's Barbecue) , and they serve some excellent country cooking items as well. The pork here is whole hog, Eastern NC style barbecue cooked in electric pits with a few hickory chips thrown in near the end, and thus has little smokiness, but properly sauced it has a decent taste, though it is a little too finely chopped, in my opinion. The sauce is vinegar based, Eastern NC style without a lot of heat. This is good, solid, but not spectacular, chopped BBQ.\n\nThe slaw is the yellow version ( a little mustard is added) found generally only in the east (and even there, sparingly, and I really like it, on either a plate or a sandwich. Hush puppies are very nice, among my favorites, as well. Their French Fries are just great, about as good as you'll find in any NC BBQ joint - I love'em. The BBQ Chicken here is nice also. The Brunswick Stew is ok, but doesn't wow you.\n\nThe Chicken and Dumplings are very much worth a shot, as is the meatloaf, and beef tips. Sides are consistently good. This place is what it is, a solid, above average BBQ joint, and there simply aren't that many decent NC style barbecue choices in the Charlotte area. You can do much worse than eat a meal or two here."
0,The guy in the store has a very poor customer service.. he looks very mean. He will price your stuff quickly without asking or interogating your medical insurance..Very poor customer service.....
4,"What an amazing experience!! Anna has magic in her hands, feet and elbows too. :) I recommend this to everyone who comes to Vegas or lives in Vegas. The Combo massage of Thai stretching, essential oils, and hot stones is wondrous."
0,"Get there when they first open cause its not crazy busy and it smells fresh. Avoid entering that store after about 2 hours of opening because the smell of man fart is extremely intense it could seriously kill you. If you can handle the smell of a warm gas chamber, then you will love this store. I love apple products but holy moly get some of those air freshness that spray every few minutes to help with that stinky warm air!"
3,"The best thing about this place are the deals they offer from time to time. I got a room for $109 on Monday facing the strip with $100 in food credit. The room itself is very modern with the newest trimmings in technology. You can literally control your room with a remote control. Just turn on the flat screen and navigate through the options and directories. You control all lights, temperature, curtains, alarm clock, entertainment, room service, check out service, etc.., The shower and tub are locked in one stall,  which is great. You got a phone in the toilet room which is EXCELLENT for those special calls!\n\nRoom service was quick and the food was not bad. Again, I had the $100 in food credit so I spoiled myself with the filet mignon. It was the best room service steak I had experience. It came with a 10oz, bowl of fries, and a variety of bread.\n\nThe downside of the Aria is what's downstairs in the Casino level. It's vacant and it just seems like a ghost town. It only has one gift and snack shop. You have the high-end Crystals mall next door but it only retails clothes. The resort is definitely catered towards adults and not families.\n\nWill I stay here again? 100% yes. It's clean, modern and the price is just right."
1,The food was good but the service was less than great
2,"Went with my parents who were visiting from out of town. I had never been but knew the location and thought it would be nice to see the view and walk around the resort after. The resort itself must be very beautiful when it is not undergoing a lot of construction. The website photos look stunning. Currently, however, many of the fountains were empty and construction barriers were up so we didn't get to enjoy the full visual effect. \nThe restaurant itself though is beautiful, and huge! We went early so there was plenty of seating, and we got a nice booth by the wall. Our server was very nice and helped make a few wine suggestions for the three of us. \nThe bread and olive oil at the beginning was standard. No interesting crackers or garlic cloves in the olive oil or anything.\nFor entrees my dad ordered the gnocchi which he didn't finish....and he usually finishes everything.  My mom ordered the organic chicken which was a pretty big portion and she had enough to take home. I opted for the wild striped sea bass. I asked for it light on the oil/butter and our server informed me that it was cooked in parchment paper and essentially steamed so it would be lighter. I thought, oh that's great! However, when it arrived, there was a pool of oil at the bottom of the parchment paper. Bummer. \nIt was a nicely cooked piece of fish, but again too oily and the artichoke hearts that accompanied it were either very dry on the outer leaves or could've had a few more leaves trimmed off. The mushrooms with it were very nice but it did not come with any spring onions, as the menu indicated.\nOur server tried to \""sell us\"" some dessert after we mentioned we were full, but overall we did like him. \nWe knew what the prices were like ahead of time,  but somehow, I don't feel like the food reflected the prices accurately."
2,"I'm rarely in the area and was joined by fellow Yelper Andy T.  to check the place out. Can't recall what else I had aside from the chitlins but I know, we've had better. Nothing really remarkable. I've been to M&M in Los Angeles and Kathy's (prior to their move) to name a few which were much better experiences for Soul Food in my opinion."
0,"To say this was the worst Mexican meal I have ever eaten would be far too kind!  It qualifies as one of the two or three worst meals I have ever eaten in my life!\n\nJen and I were in Matthews running a few errands, and decided to have lunch there.  I knew from the moment the waitress arrived with the salsa and chips that his was not going to be fun.  I just didn't imagine that it would be so horrible.\n\nThe salsa was like a bad tomato puree with a jalapeno, a bit of onion, and a few spices tossed in and blended to death.  It tasted equally mediocre as it looked.\n\nJen ordered the Camarones a la parilla ($13.69).  The waitress immediately asked, \""Do you like real spicy food?\"".  I can't imagine why!  It had a bit of flavor, but would not qualify as spicy anywhere in this part of the known universe.  The guacamole had to be the worst guacomole that ever came out of a can!  By the way, this was the better of the two items we ordered, and Jen actually seemed to like it.\n\nI couldn't decide between the Carne a la parilla ($14.69) and the Fajitas de Camar\u00f3n, Pollo o Carne Asada (Daily $), so I asked the waitress for her suggestion.  She said, \""The fajitas are great, and you can still have the beef.\""  Okay, fajitas it is.  If that was the better choice, this place needs to be burned to the ground tomorrow!\n\nThe menu describes the dish as, \""Shrimp, chicken or steak fajitas with onion, mushroom, zucchini, tomato, poblano peppers & tortillas\"".  If you like your beef completely flavorless and chewy, you will love this.  I did see a single piece of mushroom on the plate.  The zucchini was cooked to absolute mush.  There were no poblano peppers on my plate.  There might have been some pieces of green bell pepper in there.  This was bland, chewy, garbage!\n\nIt's rare that I don't clean my plate, even with a bad meal.  I had to stop eating after the second bite!  I actually had to leave the place to keep from embarassing myself!\n\nThe check for this disaster was $36.00+  Do yourself a favor.  Walk over to Beantown or Thai Taste, have a good lunch, tip the server well, and still save a few dollars!!!"
1,Frequently out of basic ingredients (e.g. waffle mix) and the staff is hit or miss. Lots of potential but they take casual to a new low.
1,"It's not the worst food.... The shrimp cocktail had 4 shrimp thats $1.25 per shrimp, 1/4 of an avocado and a few pieces of chopped onion... I'm not sure what the other dishes are like, but don't order this one...."
1,It's okay. It's quick and easy while I'm on my lunch from school. The salad dressings are really bland and they charge little hidden fees for toppings in the soup even though the soup is advertised that way then they don't ask if you want the toppings and just put them on so you kinda have no choice. They also never ask me what size I want my items and give me the large which sucks because I can't eat all that.
1,"Small portions, high prices.. at least the place looks nice.\n\nNow this is probably one of those places you need to go to more than once to get an accurate opinion, but I was pretty disappointed. This is a cheaper version of a Jose Andres restaurant, (cause not eveyone can afford to eat at E)\n\nThere are a couple good menu items, the chilaqulies are good if you are a cheese fanatic, the pork belly tacos are great, with thin slices of pineapple, and the Dan Dan Mien is delicious with home made noodles. The lengua tacos were decent, nothing special but not bad. Remember everything here is tapa sized, very small portions. Each person needs to order about 3-4 dishes in order to get full. \n\nTwo menu items here ran about $30 which is very expensive for the average Mexican/Chinese food you get here. Yes its a fusion restaurant, but you can get better food at Komex. The place itself looks great. Very trippy looking restaurant, kind reminds you of a neon enfused hole-in-the wall.  But honestly, after such a disappointing first visit I don't think I could every come back."
2,"Was the pizza awesome?  Umm no but it was tasty.  it wasnt the best and it wasnt the worst - it was just typical thin crust pizza.  the entrance was really cool though - a long hallway covered with old record covers.  I would recommend it if you need a snack to hold you over, but there are better places to eat at the Cosmopolitan.  I got the sausage and pepperocini one and i liked it but it wasnt as good as some of the pizza i have had in places like Joe's in NYC"
1,"We ordered takeout from Flamingo Palace last night and it wasn't very good. The Broccoli Beef smelled funny to me so I didn't try it. The Sesame Chicken was ok, but didn't stand out. Neither did the General Tso Chicken. Both fried chicken dishes were extremely soggy, but I guess that's expected for most takeout. White rice was a tad bit hard. Egg rolls were good though. It makes me a little sad to say that Panda Express has the best Chinese food in the immediate area. I wish Shangri-La would open a location on this side of town."
4,This restaurant is the best part of this hotel. Great burgers and sandwiches in an awesome setting. Cool decor and very comfortable. Nice happy hour options. Loved the turkey pastrami. The hotel is lousy but this restaurant is great!
2,"Ok, I preface this with the fact that there was a LARGE indonesian community back home where I lived, and there was probably a significant portion of my life where I existed on Nasigoreng and lumpias.... Was this healthy, hell no.  But I was 14 and had the metabolism of, well.... a 14 year old... Sigh.. those were the days..\n\nSo everytime I go to Bandung, I am a *tiny* bit saddened that they don't \""do it like they did back home\"" (he he he... that sounds.. ahem!).  Which is why I've started having cocktails before.  Their Long Island Iced Thai Tea is a dream.  It's EXACTLY what a LIIT should be, a poor excuse for trying to get as much alcohol as possible in one container.  Add the creamy goodness of a Thai tea, and WOW... you've got a sweet and exotic drink that will satisfy the masses.  The lumpias are so crisp and delicious.  \n\nThe nasigoreng...well... I've had better, but they do make a good job at it, I WILL say.  I think it's got to be something with the tofu.  I *thought* they don't season the tofu, and thus when you eat the nasigoreng, the rice and veggies are really good, but maybe if you leave the rice for the next day, the taste will seep in the tofu.  Well.. Thanks to their GENEROUSLY sized portions, this is exactly what I did.  I tasted the nasi the next day... PERFECTION.  Too bad I can't exactly recommend to them to give me last night's nasigoreng.... hehe.\n\nFried banana dessert (hey, I'm ALL about desserts), is a dream....."
1,"Yes the buffet is huge, but honestly it wasn't very good! Especially for 22.50 a plate."
1,"So I was craving an sundae earlier, I decided to pop by this DQ and got the medium size sundae with strawberry. After paying for the sundae, I was shocked by the size of the sundae, the server said he had weighed out the sundae too, it was as big as the vanilla cone. If you want every want a sundae, don't come here. Its no way as good as the Costco very berry sundae! Hands down!"
1,"probably the weakest club that i have been to in vegas. we came on a sunday night because we got in for free and we were told it was popular. boy were we wrong, we should have stuck with our original plan to go to XS. the place barely filled up. it seemed more like a gambling lounge, which guys would love. there were tables for blackjack and poker and pretty girls in sexy bunny outfits dealing the cards. we did leave and came back past 12 it still was not crackin here. but we still were able to have some fun and found some cute guys to hang with.\n\nwe also got 3 comped drinks if you enter their playboy club model search. they dont let you know that until you fill out the paper and you have to take several head shots for them. but i guess it is worth the comped drinks."
2,"Driving down Rainbow all the time and we always pass by Nagoya 2.  But leave it to an advertisement selling their newest addition to the menu \""AYCE Korean BBQ\"" to have us coming through their doors.\n\nOnce you get passed the boring facade, you walk into a large restaurant establishment with a bar to the right, sushi bar in the middle, tables to the left, and bbq tables on the further left\n\nThe Husband wanted AYCE Korean BBQ, and there's only one way he can get it - if I order it with him.  (It's offered to parties of two or more doing AYCE only.)\n\nAdult prices: $19.95\nKid prices: 8 years old and younger: $12.95\n\nA little banchan starts your Korean meal - Korean pancake, broccoli, pickled cucumbers, and potato. Not much here.\n\nAs the waitress was getting our table set up, I asked her if I'm supposed to go ahead and tell her what I want.  She mentioned something about them usually bringing everything out, unless I have a preference.  We definitely did have a preference because we didn't quite want it all!\n\nThere are about seven different appetizers to choose from, we went with:\n\n* Garlic Edamame \""Soy bean with spicy garlic sauce)\n* Gyoza (Deep fried dumpling)\n* Chicken Wing (Spicy marinated)\n\nThe kitchen list has about six items, and we got:\n\n* Tonkatsu (Deep fried breaded pork)\n* Vegetable Tempura (Assorted vegetable deep fried)\n* Kake Udon (Thick noodles soup with fried tofu, fish cake, seaweed)\n* Fried Rice (Vegetable)\n\nFrom the Korean BBQ list of four items:\n\n* Galbi (Angus marinated BBQ beef ribs)\n* Samgyubsal (Pork belly)\n(Our waitress did all the cooking for us here, so that was nice.)\n\nFrom the Classic Rolls list of seven items:\n\n* Salmon Skin Roll (grilled salmon skin)\n* Spicy Tuna Roll (spicy tuna, cucumber)\n\nFor dessert, you get only one scoop of vanilla or green tea ice cream.\n\nThe staff really didn't want our fellow diners to not do AYCE with us, but we told them otherwise.  The MIL and her companion chose to order off their regular Japanese menu.  They both had the Combination Dinner Special which includes salad, rice, miso soup, gyoza, and two items from their list for $13.50.  (It's $15.50 if you want three items.)  She went for the tonkatsu and miso saba, while he went for the shrimp tempura and calamari tempura.  However, we think he got the short end of the stick because there were only two pieces of shrimp and the rest were veggies.  (In retrospect, he would have done the Shrimp Tempura Entree dinner for $12.90 and gotten 6 pieces of shrimp instead.)  What a bummer!  They also got what looked like a half order of a CA roll with their meal.\n\nService was good for the latter part.  Our initial waitress was a bit spacey, until we moved into the bbq section and then that waitress was better and a lot more friendlier.  \n\nIt was only a Tuesday night, but they had a steady stream of customers - some sitting at the tables, another sitting at the AYCE bbq section, and more sitting at the sushi bar.  They have a pretty extensive menu, and the sushi menu is pretty long.\n\nOverall, it wasn't bad for AYCE.  Sure, we've had a better selection for a fraction of the price, but it'll have to do for the southwest area for now.  But for more bang for your buck, you're better off over on Spring Mountain."
4,"SW makes the best steak in Vegas.\n\nKind of a bold statement for a guy who's eaten at dozens of the best rated steakhouses across the country, and probably dozens in Vegas alone. An even bolder statement for a city known for luxury, extravagance and world class restaurants, particularly its steakhouses.\n\nI went with very low expectations. I love the Wynn and all, but not for its food (can we say most overrated buffet?). But we had some rooms here, and the SW was chosen out of convenience. It was also one of the few my buddies and I hadn't tried yet. The reviews I read were positive, but not gushing which isn't good for a town over-saturated with five star reviews. I was warned about cheesey water-light shows with giant frog puppets. The pictures I saw her on Yelp didn't show me dishes that looked to be particularly special. To be honest I tried to lead my friends over to CUT which had been spectacular on a previous trip. But I relented. And thank God I did.\n\nThere was a wait so we grabbed a couple of Macallan's at the bar. And we waited.\n\nOur table gets called and I walk into a giant dining area. It's reminiscent of a giant ballroom with giant glass windows on one side giving a view of said frog puppet show. I wasn't impressed. The decor was less than promising. It didn't scream hip like N9NE, nor sexy and dark like CUT or craftsteak. It looked like the restaurant tried to go for a posh elegance look, but got tired half way. Not a promising start.\n\nThen the food began to come out.\n\nFantastic. Start-to-finish. \n\nFor bread they give you cheesy bacon bread, as if they thought you might not get enough meat during your meal. It was so deliciously salty and fluffy and different. We asked for more than one basket.\n\nThe steak I chose was a bone-in rib eye, my go-to cut about 90% of the time. I know when it's good and when it's just alright and this was toe-curling, eyes-in-the-back-of-the-head orgasmic. Perfect sear and crust on the outside. Perfectly medium rare on the inside. It's honestly difficult to get this just right so I usually err on the side of rare+ in case it comes out overcooked. This was medium rare done right, where the meat has the slightest crunch on the outside and almost melts with every bite, gushing with flavor with each bite.\n\nMost sides don't even get a mention in my reviews, but the black truffle creamed corn which we got on a server's recommendation was amazing. I'd go back just for the corn alone. You cannot eat here without getting the creamed corn as a side. The mac and cheese and au gratin potatoes were pretty good too but not quite withdrawal-symptoms-inducing memorable.\n\nAs a male, red-blooded American, it is my God-given honor to eat right meat. It's almost a duty, given the forefathers who died to give me this freedom. I vote and I pay my taxes. God bless America and it's cattle industry. God bless the SW Steakhouse.\n\nAfter awhile, the frog puppet thing kind of grows on you."
4,"SO awesome! I drive from Indian Trail just for the Lunasagna. So fresh, healthy, filling, creative, DELICIOUS! Small place, so get there early (or late!)."
3,"ok.   The good: \n\n Duck Liver Mousse is fantastic and paired really well with pear marmalade, the vidalia bisque with truffle oil and bacon was good but I probably should have gotten the butternut squash bisque.   God I love that stuff.   For right now that is all I have tried,  I just went in for a quick bite and to talk with management about the following weekends plans.   As far as service and the help,  Kristy (Christy) the bartender, was pretty much the only one I had contact with minus the floor manager,   Kristy was awesome,  very knowledgeable with the menu and knew how to make someone feel comfortable.   She explained every dish I asked about and was actually able describe the taste.  Koodus to her.\n\nThe bad:\n\nPlaza Midwood has gone to sh!t.  Parking is awful, everything is trendy,  buildings are becoming gaudy looking, and the people wear KHAKIS WITH OXFORDS!  \nThe Peculiar Rabbit is the epitome of the present Plaza/Midwood.    I suppose it is something I am just going to have to get use to.   \n\nI will re-review next time I go in for a sit down dinner and try a few more items.\n\n\n***Review Update***\n\nIn all fairness the above review was done after a night of heavy drinking and I wasn't in the best of moods.   \n\ni have been back to The Peculiar Rabbit 3 times since that review.  On my first return trip, I ate upstairs at the bar with a bud of mine and Frances the bartender was on point and very cordial. No complaints in the service Dept.   Food.   Disco Fries are exactly what I thought, pulled roast beef and gravy, but with a hint of lemon juice.  Atleast, I think it was lemon juice.  Good twist none the less.    But here we go.  I have found a new favorite sandwich.    DUCK CONFIT REUBEN!  BOOM!     I love reubens.  But they must be made perfectly.   This thing was insane!    If you like reubens and you like duck.   Hell if you dont like duck you still should try it.   Winterberry sauerkraut and gruyere cheese, rye and duck.  Who would have thought????  Geoff Bragg did.    Now the not soo nice.   Bahn Mi.   A ground pork patty vietnamese style.     The \""Wheres tha Beef?\"" Lady was the first thing to come to mind.    Lots of bread, not a lot of interior.    Honestly,  I suggest passing on this one.    Its a pork patty seasoned with soy and terryaki with carrots, daikon, cilantro and jalenpeno.   Sounds really good, but there really just isn't enough there for the bun size.\n\nMy 3rd visit was just for a beer.\n\nFourth visit here,   4pm in the afternoon Fri. Best time to talk up the staff and just chill.   New Belgium Winter Snow and the SWEET TEA BRINED WINGS.     Watch out for the mustard!    Wholly cow, it will blow you mind if you have too much on there.   Highly recommend this app.   For the price you do actually get a good portion. Four actual chicken legs.   Not small drummets as in wings.    Actual Chicken legs and these things are good!   Word at the bar,  SuperBowl Sunday 2013 they are 50 cents a piece.  I am becoming boggle minded as I look for my next course.   Its a toss up between the lamb lollipops and the steak skewers.   I love lamb and have been wanting to try the lamb sandwich or the lollipops,  Louie the Barkeep has confirmed the Lamb Lollipops is the way to go for my second course.    (Did I mention I was actually at the bar doing this review?  Yea, I kept forgetting to update it since my first visit, so I decided to finally knock out this review.) \n\n Btw,   I have to admit.  The barstaff here is the one of the best in all of Charlotte.   Not only do they know the menu but they have tried it and actually can tell you the tastes and textures.    Koodus to them.  Kristy(Christy), Francis, and Louie.\n\nLamb has arrived.   brb.\n\nLollipops.  Served with Hummus that has a good spice kick to it, a salsa of sorts that adds good dimension to the lamb and grilled flat bread.   The lollipops themselves are kind of like a meat ball but none the less great.   YES Recommend this one.   Two pops, a healthy serving of hummus and flatbread.     Ask for tzatziki if you are expecting it.   I am sure it will round out the flavors quite well.   \n\nSo there you have it.   I personally think the food is great and will come back to finish out the menu.  Prices are fair, so quit your whining.   The staff is very cool and well versed in the menu.  Atleast, my three were.   Kristy (Christy), Francis, and Louie.  \n\nAs to the clientele,  yeah, its khakis and button downs.  The old Midwood is changing, we are just going to have to accept that.   Peculiar Rabbit, got a lot of flack in the beginning but honestly,  I like it.  Good Decision on this one."
3,"I've always loved Mac's on South Blvd but over the years it hasn't been like when it first opened, but Queen City Q is a welcomed surprise. The food (the sausage and pulled pork) is really tasty. I have tried the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese - both good sides. The service was fast and friendly - I went once for a work lunch and once on the weekend with my kid - both times it was wonderful. I would totally recommend this place to anyone coming into uptown who wants some yummy BBQ. Can't wait to go back! \n\np.s. If you love local beer, this is the place for you too!"
0,This place is filthy.  I ordered before I looked around.  As I have been here for 10 minutes at 10am and not one staff member has cane to clean a table and the bathrooms are disgusting. Go to the one at Chandler and 101
2,"I'm hoping this place is better on the weekends than when we visited on a Monday night. The server started by telling us all the things they were out of :( I'd been lured by the promise of charbroiled oysters, which were a complete disappointment. The gumbo and spinach salad were delicious."
3,"Things come and go in Vegas, but this one is consistently good.  Lovely ambiance.  Really great food."
0,On their door and on yelp its stated its open till 9 on sat. We got there at 8:15 and it was locked and the guy who was working the place didn't even respond to us standing outside.
3,"I've been on a super healthy eating kick lately and this place has been a godsend. You can literally fill your entire shopping cart with fresh produce and spend less than $20. Prices vary greatly depending on what they have in stock, but I've seen eggplant selling at 3 for $1, massive blackberry clamshells for $.50, and avocados at 20 for $1.\n\nHowever, it's not the nicest shopping environment. We affectionately call it \""Ghetto Market.\"" It's small and crowded. During winter the snowbirds are out in force. Much of the fruit and veg is close to (or past) its peak. You need to look closely at what you're buying. I've brought home moldy strawberries more than once. And don't even think about trying to find anything organic.\n\nRegardless, the prices are so good it's worth it if you live anywhere near East Mesa."
4,"The staff here is super friendly, informative and proud of their product. Classy selection of teas."
2,"Tried the peanutbutter crunch burger. It was very good. Some detracting points on execution: unevenly cooked burger, unevenly spread toppings, and i forgot there was pimento cheese because I couldn't taste it. I ordered a chocolate malt shake and paid $9 for it, but I was never served the accompanying cake that goes with it.  Fix those and it gets another star."
3,"I've gone here for waxing a  couple times, and had a mixed experience. They did a great job on my eyebrows, but for bikini waxes, they were too fast (3 GIANT strips of wax, all off at once) and ended up asymmetrical.\n\nEDIT: Have been going for a while now, and the earlier in the day you go, the better experience you will have. Tracy is great!"
4,"Madison needs more gastropubs, it's true. Brasserie V is here to answer the prayers of the people. Great beer list, amazing and decently priced wines. Best mussels and frittes I have had in ages! Excellent service. And was the perfect setting for a romantic date! I will be back!\n\nI'm getting hungry just thinking about that dinner, it was exceptional."
4,"A-Ma-Zing.  \n\nI could really just stop there and it would cover it all.  But, I think people would be happier with some details.  I went there Friday 6/1 for dinner with my husband and teenage daughter to celebrate hubby's birthday.  I'd read a lot of great reviews of Studio B and we wanted something a little upscale - food-quality-wise.  We were not disappointed.\n\nInitially, things did not start well.  We paid almost immediately and then had to stand in line for 15 minutes or so to be seated.  15 minutes is not that long, but we'd already paid, so it was more irritating than anything else.  But, we were seated at a lovely table near the bar, which please my husband immensely and he mostly forgot about the wait.\n\nWe made a quick stop at the bar to take advantage of the included beer/wine.  I was really surprised to see that there were a number of options, including a raspberry cider and a draft rootbeer.  My husband had some sort of microbrew lager, and I had the cider.  It was crisp and refreshing and very tasty.  \n\nOk, but the food... that's the big thing... It was almost unending in quantity and variety.  There were 6-8 carving stations with Prime rib, ribs, turkey, chicken, etc in addition to hundreds of buffet offerings.  It was not laid out as well as some buffets I've been to, it seemed that most of it was thematic, but there were things mixed in everywhere.\n\nThe selling point of the buffet is the weekend seafood.  No question about it.  And they lived up to the hype.  I personally ate hot crab legs, shrimp, mussels, some fish & chips (that was soggy) and some calamari.  There was also crayfish, dozens of varieties of shellfish and fish dishes.  Additionally, we loved the gnocchi and bacon dish, the mac and cheese, the pad Thai, miso soup and the tomato and mozzarella salad (I think they make their own cheese).  We sampled a variety of desserts and we happy with everything - I loved the gelato.  \n\nIn all, this was fantastic.  When you took the drinks into account (2 each for hubby and I), the $30 price tag per person is not unreasonable by any means.  The food was hot and tasty.  We won't be going back often because of the price, but I know we'll go back."
3,The room and bathroom are huge! I love the big bathtub too. \nThe pool area is also amazing because the swimming pool is huge. The drinks were a bit too pricey and the poolside service was slow. I will definitely be staying here for now on though.
3,"First impressions when i walked in the door was that the restaurant was pretty clean and that it smelled wonderful, both are very good signs. I came here based on the ratings and reviews here on Yelp. And, you definitely get the most out of your money here (at least in Las Vegas...). I gravitated to their xiaolongbao, also known as \""soupy buns\"". The xiaolongbao 's skin was done just right, the filling could have been a little more salty, but quickly fixed with a little of the vingear dipping sauce. If you're up to getting the spicy pig ears, it was by far my favorite appetizer here.\n The soup dishes weren't anything to rave about, but decent. on the other hand, the chef sure does know how to work a wok. \nThe stir fried hollow vegetables were cooked perfectly!\n\nOverall, a very good lunch spot."
3,"i thought this was a  cool sports bar. casual, not upscale. it had a big wall of tvs. it reminded me alot of gallaghers (after gallaghers were remodeled.)  there's alot of seating and there's a separte room for off track betting with alot of seating. the food was very good. much better quality then you'd get at alot of sports bars.  the menu is very cheap for the quantity and quality of food you're getting. most menu items were between $6-$8. we ordered a crab cake sandwich which is no longer on the menu, but they'll make it for you anyway. you get two huge, quality crab cakes on buns with a side for $7.00 . i've had 2 tiny crab cakes as appetizers at black angus for 9.99 which didn't compare. these crab cakes were awsome and would cost much more as a lunch anywhere else. also ordered burgers. good flavor, lots of toppings. the service was very prompt.  however, the thing that ruined our otherwise great meal, was the management tried to rip us off on our bill, not our waitress. they charged all of us $1.50 per meal  upcharge for our sides that were suppose to be included  with our meals. the menu clearly states that our sides were included. after i pointed this out, the waitress said \""our menus are old. now your sides are no longer free. and you'll have to pay for them.\"" this was per the manager instructing her what to say. after telling her we would pay what the menu states and that's it, she took all the extra charges off the bill. i told her if they weren't free anymore, they need to tell the customer while ordering and not to just tack on extra charges hoping the customer wouldn't notice.  so, the atmosphere is fun. food is really good. just watch your bills."
2,"In 1996, when the Luxor was somewhat new, I was in my teens hanging out with my parents (when it was still okay for kids to go to Vegas because there were cool arcades to go to), I saw the Luxor as the place to stay and would often ask my parents if we could stay there someday. Fast forward to last weekend, on a last minute plan to go to Vegas, I finally had the opportunity to stay at Luxor.\n\nThe place doesn't really have the same awe to me like it had back in the 90's, and from what I've heard, after a couple of years it has toned back a bit on the Egyptian theme throughout the casino.\n\nWe stayed in the West Tower (unfortunately, not the pyramid, damn), so we couldn't try the inclinators. I assume it's probably not big deal, but I'm still curious about it anyway.  The rooms we stayed in were two doubles, and all in all the room looked pretty clean. The room isn't big though, it seems to be around 400-500 sq ft and isn't the best place to stay if you intend to have 4+ people to stay in the room. Also, everything in the room seems to be updated recently, and besides the samsung lcd tv, it doesn't have the things you would expect at the newer hotels in the area. \n\nThe rest of the casino is pretty much standard, there's a small food court area that has a McDonald's, there are two clubs Cathouse and LAX, and the casino offers connections to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur (which leads to the rest of the strip).  So it's an okay place to stay, but if you are looking to see the rest of the strip, try staying at the hotels a couple blocks north.  Unless you want to walk everywhere you go, you'll save a bit more money on taxi rides staying somewhere else.  These hotels don't look big until you have to walk through/around them."
4,What a wonderful meal!\n\nMy boyfriend and I were in Vegas on a weekend trip and I had come across SushiSamba on yelp while doing some research before our trip.  We were staying at the Venetian so the location was perfect.  We had a reservation for 10:00 on a Saturday night.  It was packed full but we were seated promptly and the service was excellent.  My favorite dish was the Neo Toyko roll.... So delicious!!!  The decor is beautiful as well and they have a wonderful party room is you have a larger group.  I will be sure to visit again next time I'm in Vegas.
3,Went to grab some sushi with Jared R. tonight.  He recommended this place from reading the reviews on here.  We started off with the miso soup which was pretty good.  Lots of Tofu and the broth had a nice flavor.  We both ordered some sake bombers to gulp down with our meal.  \n\nWe got 5 rolls which were all really good.  The first set was the yellowfin roll and the fiery shrimp.  They both were really good.  The fiery shrimp was exactly as the name said.  It had just the perfect amount of kick and shrimp.  \n\nThe next roll to come out was the Tsunami Roll which was my favorite.  It had a fried outside and lots of flavor.  The sauce that came on the plate was more than just a decoration.  \n\nLastly we had the big and spicy roll and the spicy tuna roll.  They both had a great amount of kick.  The big and spicy was very good and the best part was the pickled jalapenos on the top.  \n\nOverall this place was really good and I would totally go back again.  Thanks again for another good find Yelp.com
2,"Sad to say this place has gone downhill. Although they still make some tasty rolls, I can no longer overlook all the cons. \n\nLess-than-fresh fish (dry on the edges sitting in the case or doesn't always taste good)\n\nLack of variety (there are only so many rolls w/ shrimp tempura or crab salad on the inside that one can eat. Branch out beyond the typical Cali roll as a base. But on that note, adding Sun Chips or Cheetos atop a roll? What an insult to sushi. Have teenagers taken over the mgmt. there?)\n* Yet they have at least one really talented chef who can create some of the most creative, tasty dishes that SHOULD be on the menu!\n\nSlow service (Anyone who knows sushi knows to sit at the sushi bar for great service, not a table. The waitstaff is often slow for even the sushi bar area though.)\n\nHopefully things will turn around; otherwise, if I'm going to spend $$ on sushi, I'll travel the extra distance to a much better place."
0,"Went here for the first time on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend. We were excited to try this place after rave reviews from coworkers and friends.\n\nWOW - we were SO disappointed.\n\nThe place was not busy at all which didn't discourage us since it was a Tuesday. \n\nWe walked into the restaurant and waited by the hostess counter for about ten minutes until we were finally \""greeted\"" by the hostess. There were many employees walking by serving other tables, cleaning tables, etc that never once stopped to tell us someone would be with us shortly...kind of rude, right?\n\nWe were finally seated in the patio area and were told by the hostess that someone would be with us shortly. \n\nI kid you not - another FIFTEEN minutes went by. No one came to our table. No menus. Nothing.\n\nThe manager (who was really nice) came by our table finally and asked if we had been helped. I told him no. He left to grab us some menus and to take our drink orders. We each ordered a beer.\n\nTen more minutes pass. Nothing. In the meantime, we are watching people who arrived after us ordering/receiving their food. Very disappointing.\n\nWe finally get our beer and he left before we could put our food order in.\n\nWHY!?\n\nWe waited a few more minutes and he took our order. \n\nWe ordered the soft pretzel with mustard dipping sauce and the top sirloin salad. We asked to add avocado to the salad.\n\nOur food arrived several minutes later...and you guessed it, without avocado. \n\nAt the end of our meal, I politely informed the manager that we weer pretty disappointed with our experience. \n\nNo apology.\n\nJust a pathetic \""yeah, its' been an off night\""\n\nNeedless to say, we will NOT be coming back here. Ever."
0,This place is just awful.  The soup is oily and salty.  I
1,"This location is consistent with being inconsistent.\n\nI frequent this location because it is close to my house. ONLY REASON.\n\nI pretty much order the same thing every time:\n\n4 piece chicken nugget happy meal, ranch for my dip, for a boy and a apple juice. \nAbsolutely nothing special.\n\nYet, every time they forget something. One day it is the fries, next it will be his toy, some days it is the sliced apples. \n\nSo I have to make sure I check my order every time before I leave the drive thru window.\n\nAnd the inside is always dirty. Always."
3,"This place is a very nice destination type resort.  It's about 10 miles from the Strip but provides complimentary shuttle service to the Strip, shopping and the airport.  The casino is nice, tons of slots and table games.  I did not gamble much but those that did seem to enjoy losing their money.  I remind people that they don't build these places because they lose.  The food is pretty good, with lots of options and the drink prices are reasonable.  For a weekend getaway without the insanity of the strip, this is a good pick."
2,Good service. Beautiful interiors. Ate there for breakfast. Ordered the egg white scramble with gluten free bread. $14 and it was tiny and as good as any diner. All the ordered breakfasts at my table were tiny and just okay. Nice breakfast buffet though but Not worth the price in my opinion. Cool location though.
3,Great happy hour specials.  Great food and yummmmy food. Wednesday has family night specials.
3,"Big fan of Munchies. Salty, greasy Greek food between 5 - 10 dollars for a meal. Good daily lunch specials. Be careful on your way back from Mill, as the price hike between 6pm and 2am is noticeable the next morning."
0,"My boyfriend, his father, and I visited this restaurant for the first time on Father's Day. Surprisingly, they were not packed and had open tables. They also offered free signature burgers to all the dads. Our waitress was kind in the beginning, although she didn't tell us about the drink specials, but after taking our order we never saw her again. This was especially odd considering I had ordered a margarita, and was likely to order another had I been prompted, but I guess that's her loss. \n\nAnother individual expedited the food, and she had a horrible attitude. We watched her drop an entire tray of food on a table, and she tried giving us food that wasn't our THREE different times. It seems important that someone with the sole job of expediting food learn to read the table numbers on the tickets. She also had long flowing hair that brushed the plates and really grossed me out. PUT YOUR HAIR UP! \n\nAnyways, we had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and it took 30 minutes to finally arrive at our table, and they were stone cold. We sent them back and didn't have a problem removing them from the bill, fortunately. The food was mediocre. Not too special of a burger for what they charge, and definitely nothing so appetizing to make me want to return. \n\nI was primarily disappointed with the lack of attention we received and the wait time on our food, granted this place wasn't even packed. It was also a buzz kill to be approached by staff with such a poor attitude on day we were trying to celebrate with dad. \n\nI don't recommend this restaurant to anyone."
3,"Loved the shop itself. The artwork and the atmosphere was amazing! It was super clean and sterile as well, which is very impressive to me. I did a lot of research before settling on this location and from all the work I saw on their facebook, combined with so many positive reviews, I decided to check it out.\n\nThe reason I didn't give it the final star was because my artist was not talkative during the procedure and did not explain the after care process as in depth as I wished he had. He did do a beautiful job on the tattoo itself so I am not disappointed in any way.\n\nI will definitely go back to this location to get any future tattoos I decide on, and at that time I hope I can give it the final star!"
4,Our table shared a bunch of different dishes and everything was delicious. Especially loved the banana pudding for dessert. Service was very helpful with the menu and friendly as well.
2,"I came here after an unfulfilling dinner at Big Grove Tavern.  We sat down for some fries and a slice of pie.  Everything was great, the pie was delicious, the fries were hot, and the service was prompt and friendly.  Everything was great, that is, until I start hearing noises behind me.  I assume someone is dragging a chair across the floor.   I don't turn around, because it stopped soon enough.  Time passes and the sound starts up again. My S.O. starts looking a bit uncomfortable. I turn around, and no one is dragging a chair, but there is a man 2 booths away.  It was him.  Farting.  Having a fart-attack.  A super-extended fart-attack.\n\nHaving quickly lost my appetite, we asked for the check, left the server a hefty tip, and skedaddled.  \n\nI can't really blame Merry-Ann's for this.  This is a place for everyone, farters included!  So if you want a cheap diner, this is your place, but be aware that this is a big world, and flatulence happens."
4,"Love to stop in for the jalapeno poppers, jalapeno burgers and great selection of beer!"
4,"I don't know why I never reviewed this place sooner, but this is the home of some of the best burgers I have ever had, period.\n\nI went there with the bf for lunch, so it wasn't too busy and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a booth. I liked the fact that each booth had it's own TV. Cute.\n\nThe service was fine as well...I don't recall waiting forever or having an issue at all. Maybe it's just the luck of the draw? In any case, screw the service, focus on the burgers!\n\nI love Hubert Keller, so I was definitely expecting something amazing. I ordered the 3 sliders, which were simply DIVINE.  I still have flashbacks to eating the one with cheese and caramelized onions! If I could only have one last burger before I died, that would be the one.\n\nThere were some more expensive burgers on the menu that I had been tempted to try, but since I hadn't ever been there before, I chose to be a bit frugal until I figured out if I approved of the burgers.  Boy, do I approve!\n\nWhen I head back there though, I think I'll have to try something with truffles (my fav.!)..."
3,"Oh yeah! I finally get to see what Tryst is like?? I thought I was going to XS. Amazing how they replicated the club almost exactly like Tryst. Think of something new, geez. I'm not complaining, just wouldv'e been nice to see a fresh new look.\nThe outside was different. No waterfall here, they have a pool instead. Ha. With a few tables in the middle of the pool. Awesome! Drunk people losing their money to the casino in the club! Don't have to wait to go out to the casino tables.\nI was thinking, wow, I'm suprised they had a pool that no one can swim in just for the club, but then I started noticing warning signs for people who swim in the pool. Is this, the pool for the hotel guests?? Wow, genius but I'm not impressed anymore. No 5 stars for lack of originality, but 4 star is still good."
1,"The server was friendly, but the food was horrible.\n\nThe food took forever to come out (nearly 30 mins).\nI ordered the California Burger and fries. Fries were cold. Burger was bland. Lettuce was withered.\n\nMy mom ordered buffalo wings. Salty and cold.\n\nWon't be going back. I rather drive all the way to Chandler."
0,"Slow, confused wait staff...we got the wrong order and they never came back! RUDE cashier...do not ask me if everything was OK if you do not care... and you are a Manager!  $15.00 a person for eggs and bad attitude! What a waste of time and money!"
0,"I can't even begin to describe the TERRIBLE customer service here!! \n\nIt was my first time there and I asked the lady behind the counter what was in the coconut milk tea and coconut milk (yes.. in hindsight it seems obvious..but I wanted her to tell me what each drink looked/tasted like) \n\nShe gave me a dirty look and said \""coconut\"" while tapping her pen impatiently.\n **Uh-huh** yes, I got that much from reading your menu that both drinks have coconut.. but is there anything else you can add to that description to help me decide? Is one sweeter/thicker/blended/over ice..etc than the other? \n\nSo I raised an eyebrow at her response, but ordered the coconut milk tea and laughed it off as a typical asian place with hasty service. \n\nTHEN when my drink came, I took one sip and it literally tasted like Almond syrup sludge. So I said.. \""Um this is almond milk tea, I ordered coconut.\"" First she says \""no I wrote down here almond\"" and I stare at her and said \""I asked you about the coconut drinks then ordered it, remember?.\"" OH..this woman had the nerve to ask \""OK, SO?\"" \n\nSOoOoO?! Are you insane? How can you run a business being this rude even for Chinatown? I gave her my best death stare and told her to give me what I ordered. It got to the point where another customer who she was chatting it up with was apologizing profusely for her attitude. (Later I found out that he was an owner at the noodle shop nearby). She finally shouted something into the kitchen staff and they handed over a new drink... which still tasted like syrup sludge...now in coconut flavor. \n\nBottom line: gross sludge drink + rude service.. Go somewhere else for your boba!"
1,"Way overpriced for a below average burger. I had the gold standard burger, just not that good. My friend got the salmon burger (can't remember the name for it). The best thing he could say about it was that it was edible. Service was good, and it was a nice place."
2,"after breaking bank/emptying our wallets the night before at Olives, we opted for a slightly cheaper option.\n\nI honestly cant remember most of the meal considering we were once again in a rush to get somewhere after.  But I do remember loving and devouring my linguine with clams!  everything was divine and not heavy at all.  \n\nmy one major suggestion for this place is to sit in the \""patio\"" area as they so call it. the restaurant itself was kinda dark inside. I usually like that but it's just more fun to be pretending that your sitting outside on the streets of venice and watching the fake gondolas go by."
3,"When I \""checked into\"" this place and saw the average of 2 1/2 stars, I was thinking, yikes...this is going to be interesting.\n\nBut honestly, aside from the prices being so expensive, the food was actually delicious. Our orders arrived pretty fast...within 7-10 minutes after we placed our orders and there were still a lot of people at the restaurant. \nMy friend and I ordered pan-fried pork and chives dumpllings (6) as an appetizer and it was so delicious, I could've ordered 2 plates as my entree.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Singapore-styled noodles with shrimp, chicken, and veggies. Yes, the portions may be small for the average men, but for females...you will have leftovers if not, the perfect sized. My friend said her entree was delicious as well.\n\nThe reason why I gave my review 4 stars versus 5 is because I do agree with the other reviews....the price for what you get can get some people upset. Or feel like they got cheated out on.  But if money wasn't an issue for you, if you have any food & beverage credits or anything similar like that....this would be a great place to dine at here at Caesars Palace."
4,I Love this place when I am home in Carefree.  They have a great menu and are very helpful with regards to my food allergies!!  Sometimes I just have a glass of wine (or 2) but have tried many things on the menu.  My current dinner favorite is the Chicken Schnitzel!  Good sized portion and very tasty!  They now have Cider on tap too....Delicious!
4,"Bouchon was the absolute perfect place for a classy Saturday brunch before getting down and dirty at the Lavo day club later on in the day.\n\nThey do not take ressies for brunch, but was told that if you arrive pre 11am, or post 1pm, you should not have an issue getting a table; just be seated before kitchen closes at 2pm and you are golden. Given my love for brunches waaaaay late in the day, obvi my group of 7 and I arrived a little after 1pm and only waited 5 mins for our table to be ready. \n\nThe atmosphere is light and airy - reminding me a bit of Balthazaar in the city. The menu was extensive & everything sounded amazing, but I knew I HAD to get the chicken & waffles [$25] as well as the croque madame [$19]. A few of us started with some coffee which was rich and aromatic. \n\nThey began by placing 2 \""branches\"" of olive bread on our table. They legit looked like branches! Super cute - we all just grabbed a \""leaf\"" and pulled. It was like having a wishbone moment at Thanksgiving, except we were all winners! ;)\n\nThe plates arrived soon after, and the portions were very very very generous. My friend and I split the C&W and CM and could not finish our meal at all. The CM comes with like 5lbs of french fries! I was pleased to read that the C&W was not fried but roasted, as I had given up fried food for Lent. The chicken on that dish was SOOO succulent, moist, and tasty. It came with gravy, but was juicy enough to eat on its' own. Each dish comes with a dark meat and a white meat piece - both of which were amazeballs. The waffles are infused with BACON(!!) and chives, and had the right amount of crisp in them. The CM was good, but nothing amazing. I did enjoy the slippery egg on top and the perfectly runny yolk.\n\nThe other girls ordered the Salmon Baguette [$16] (which you have to assemble yourself - cute, but I like my food done for me, thx), pot of mussels [$25.50] (lots and lots of lots and mussels!), and the sourdough waffles [$12] (the girl who ordered this is a waffles fiend, so she def liked it =D)\n\nSuch a great meal w/ my best girlfriends. Would definitely return if I'm ever back in Vegas (psh, if? More like when...)"
3,"Amarena, bacio, toffee crunch, pumkin mousse cake - oh, YUM!! For the $12 that I paid, it's definitely worth it! Smooth, flavorful and creamy. It reminded me of my trip to Italy all over, again.\n\nThis is a great gelato spot. It's definitely at a great location, for some people watching. The folks were friendly and patient, as I asked to sample several of their flavors. \n\nA must check out spot, when you want your sweet tooth satisfied."
0,I used to love this place  and come every Sunday with large group of people but lately the bouncers at the door  holds the  line for no reason. Last Sunday While the place was 1/3 full I had to wait in line for 30 minutes. However the door guy let about 50 people whom he didn't bother to check IDs because he knew them. This attitude needs to change and everyone should be respected. If we have to pay to get in the. Post a cover charge I would gladly pay that 5 or 10 dollar at the door than bribing your door guy. Last time I check bribing was against the law. Hire new door guys who is not associated with same douchy Scottsdale crowd so everyone get a chance to experience this place. Customer service starts at the door el Hefe management team not at the table. Till then I will take my money somewhere else...
1,"I really dislike going here, but it can't be avoided sometimes due to being located close to home, and they actually have good prices on a lot of home goods.\nMy biggest complaint about this place is not the parking, once you learn to park on the second floor and just walk up a flight of stairs its no problem. The problem is the employees most of the time.\nMy biggest gripe is the employee who is paid to tell me what line to get into. \nIt's really not that bad, and I understand trying to maintain even distribution for the cashiers, but its when that person becomes a group of 5-6 employees, standing and talking right in the middle of the already crowded main walkway. They absolutely ignore any kind of  responsibility and instead I have heard quite a few Fri/Sat night stories between employees instead of actually doing some kind of tangible work.(ex. opening another lane instead of figuring out how not to do work)\nI find myself coming here less and less, again, not because of the location, parking, but strictly because of what seem like lack of leadership in the front end of the store which is frustrating to no end. \nWhen you have 2 items and it takes you 30 minutes to get out of the store, something is wrong."
3,"I should only order enchiladas @ Carolina's, I guess, because I am always disappointed when I order them anywhere else.  One star for excellent service, one star for awesome beans, one star for serving Pepsi, and one star for plentiful bike racks along Mill Ave.  Found the popular American music an odd choice...Stevie Nicks is not what I expect to hear while I'm noshing on chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa are complimentary.  And the salsa has a slight bite and is very flavorful."
1,"My husband and I stopped here for lunch at random, and our experience started off well enough with rather addicting chips and salsa.  We ordered a queso dip as well for them, which made them that much munchier.  However, with the exception of their signature margarita (which was quite lovely), nothing else managed to bump the star rating for us.\n\nWe both ordered the chicken chimichanga.  It was edible, but no where near worth what we paid for them.  And they were FULL of cheese.  A good thing you'd think, right?  Not this time, it was overkill. \n\nThe most disappointing thing though was the general lack of attention to detail in cleanliness.  The tables had bits of... stuff still on them, as did the base of the spiral-stand that held our chips.  The floors were dirty.  And my husband discovered a stack of fossilized Mexican-food crumbs pressed in between the seat cushions of the booth.\n\nA shame, because at first glace it looks like an awesome little place.  We'll probably not make this decisions again, unless we're just after drinks and chips."
3,"I love Frick Park. I practically grew up there. There are so many different parts of Frick Park. I no longer live in walking distance and have to drive a long way to get there.\n\n Now my kids love it, the dog loves it, and of course I still love it there. A total getaway, and a means of vigorous activity that we enjoy every minute of. \n\nThe only reason I left out a star is because of my own bias.  I believe it was better in the early 80's with the old iron and steel slides and wooden/rubber swings, the stairs on the trails made of logs, and the streams were wider and deeper. I kind-of liked when the trails were not so maintained. You sort of felt like you were discovering everything before.  I swear the blue slide was longer, but it's probably just that I was much smaller. Please don't crucify me for that last star....Doesn't everyone prefer things the way they use to be?"
4,"It's hard to find an AC company that wants nothing more than to make you happy.  With fair prices and dedicated service, this family owned and operated company comes highly recommended.  They go the extra mile to solve problems and don't leave you with a lot of surprises.  You want someone you can trust...call them."
3,"Review for the Midwestern University (MWU) Dental Institute.  At a time when dental insurance is a luxury, MWU DI offers affordable and quality care for many who need dental care.  At the MWU DI, patients have access to comprehensive dental care from routine cleanings and restorations to specialists in endodontics, prosthodontics, periodontics, orthodontics, oral surgery, oral pathology, radiology and pediatrics.  How does it work?  A patient can call in to make a free screening appointment to see if he or she would be a good patient for teaching.  After the patient is accepted, student dentists (a 3rd + 4th year dental student pair) begin a comprehensive exam (digital x-rays, impressions/models, perio charting, med history, and exams inside your mouth and around your head/neck) under the supervision of licensed dentists/dental faculty.  Subsequent appointments will then fulfill the patient's chief concerns and other needs necessary to restore his or her oral health.  The MWU DI's facility is state of the art, and prices are truly affordable.  Clinic faculty members are very experienced and student dentists are able to provide quality care, but be prepared to block off 2-3hrs off your morning or afternoon schedule for an appointment and be patient for some surgical services that may have a long wait for an appointment.  \n\nhttp://www.mwuclinic.com/az/di"
0,"Okay, this is going to be my first negative Yelp review:  I came in an ordered $5 of food -- a medium pizza with one topping -- a suggestion by the owner.  When I got my\norder I also asked for some more red peppers, a cup water, and some napkins.  The owner (a guy with one tooth, or so he appeared) brought me the peppers, but not\nthe water or napkins.  I asked again for both and he brought me some water grudgingly -- it had no ice.  I asked about the napkins and his response:  \""Is that it, do you want me to keep going back and forth -- for a $5 order?\""  \n\nCan you say a-s-s-h-o-l-e?  As if whether the fact that I chose to patronize his establishment and paid $5 or $50 should make a difference in the way I'm treated.  All\nI do is to recommend:  \""STAY AWAY!\"""
4,"This place is perfect. Excellent soup, excellent smoothies, relatively speedy drive-thru, friendly customer service, amazing soup. Everything I have tried there was very satisfying. Breakfast stuff is all amazing and not greasy. Their combos are great. I would go today but they are closed on Sundays."
0,"On our vakantion they ask us for breakfast, I ask Lisa (bitch from the customer service) Is iT about time sharing, she Sa\u00efd no iT is not, and we Will get. $75,- if we go.\nWe went and it was about time sharing, so we went back to Lisa, and we did not get the $75,- because we did not stay the 90 minuten. She was laying to us and Being rude. The rooms are noisy. I don't come back here ever!!!!!!!!!"
3,"We ate dinner here tonight and really enjoyed it.  The server immediately offered us breadsticks with sauce that were yummy.  My family had a small pizza that my two girls shared, and didn't finish, a Stromboli, and some of their greek chicken.  I can say that it was all very fresh and tasty.  Our server Chelsea was very attentive, and made sure we had what we needed.  We ordered the strawberry shortcake for dessert, and this is the only thing that stood in the way of a 5 star rating.  I have a personal vendetta against the red goo used for strawberry shortcake, so it wasn't my fave.\nWe definitely have added this place to one of new favorite joints to go to for a quick, reasonably priced meal, where all of our tastes can be accommodated.  I think next time, I'll go with the homemade carrot cake!"
1,I've been here a few times and both times I've been disappointed. The shrimp they use tastes like it's been frozen forever and very rubbery. \nAfter the second time I've decided that there are other Mexican taco places I could eat at.
3,"Le poulet et le poisson sont d\u00e9licieux. Les portions sont g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses. Je sugg\u00e8re de commander pour emporter si vous habiter proches, puisque le service peu \u00eatre lent et le restaurant bond\u00e9. Prenez-vous d'avance pour les commandes pour emporter."
1,"fyi . . .This review is for take-out meals.\n\nWe ordered three meals . . . not going to comment on the sides, as everyone liked the sides and they seemed to be fairly normal portions.\n\nGeorgia Chopped Pork Platter - very good flavor . . . VERY small portion\nFirecracker Green Beans\nPineapple Steaks (which are NOT listed as a side on the 'order on line' feature, so I had to call them, to order.\n\nCounty-Roasted Chicken Platter (half-chicken) - Good flavor, portion size is a little bigger than half a Cornish game hen.\nMashed Potatoes\nBroccoli\n\nSt. Louis-Style Ribs (half slab) - these were excellent.  fall off the bone. and had good flavor; however, the description says \""...slathered with sauce and flame-kissed to seal in the flavor and caramelize the sauce for a touch of crispiness\""   . . . they had no sauce on them at all.\nFamous Fries\nWilbur Beans\n\nIt cost around $47 for three people.\n\nWould I order take out from them again?  Probably not.  Wouldn't mind the price, if the meat portions weren't so skimpy."
3,"Why am I reviewing a beer warehouse?  Because in Pennsylvania your life will depend on these few and far between places to purchase alcohol.\n\nIn all my time visiting relatives in PA I never realized that in regards to alcohol it's like visiting a foreign country.  I used to think Norway was annoying but PA takes to a whole other level.\n\nLet me see if I have the rules right.\n\n1) You can't buy alcohol and places you normally can, like the grocery store, corner store, etc.  You have to go go special stores that sell just alcohol (all you scandis should be familiar with this concept).\n\n2) Beer and Wine/Hard Liquor are sold separately in different stores not even close to each other.\n\n3) You can only buy beer in cases from the beer store.\n\n4) You can buy 6-packs at any bar.  I'm not sure what the price rules are for buying from the bar.\n\nSo in my time in Pittsburgh I was only able to visit this beer warehouse (hey, it takes a while to work through a case of beer).  Not sure if this is usually the case but the selection here was awesome.  If this is what it means to have special beer stores, then I'm all for them, except I would like them on top of and not instead of the normal grocery store/liquor stores.  Beers from all over the country and all over the world.  And not just cheap weird stuff you've never heard of but good brands.\n\nPrices weren't the best but I'm assuming there's little you can do when the state sets up a monopoly like this."
4,Awesome place for healthy food!
0,Soak toilet paper noodles and the broccoli in the vegetarian pho felt like they were cut using a dog :) \nenough said ... \nThe server was a really cool dude late at night ...
1,"Menu looked promising. Ribs had good smoke ring,but were dry, not what I was hoping for. Chicken had interesting spice combo, hard yo eat. Baked beans were good. A bit pricy for the portions served. Probably would rate this place as a one & done."
0,"The people that work here are idiots! I ordered 5 footlong subs and they couldn't get any of them right despite me standing over them directing them. And yes, this Subway is cheap, cheap, cheap on the toppings!!!"
3,"Great design and materials shop for flooring and backsplash materials!  They manufacture many of their own products.  \n\nThey will sell directly to the public, but not at the same low prices their contractor customers get.  \n\nAsk for their \""preferred contractor\"" list if you need an installer.\n\nThey have 2 design consultants on hand and my wife and I found them to be very helpful and friendly in planning our backsplash design.  We went home with several samples and ended up having our installer purchase our materials there.\n\nThe store has a pretty good selection of products on display, but isn't as big as a few of the other design shops out there, thus the 4 star rating.\n\nStill, would highly recommend UBC."
0,"The receipt we came home with says Restaurant Le Caveau, but the location is not that mentioned on the yelp site.  They might have two locations.  The one we visited was on 410 Place Jaques.  We were in the Old Montreal part of town on Saturday June 8 looking for a spot to eat.  It was the Grand Prix week-end so naturally a lot of places were full.  It was fairly chilly outside and drizzling and we had been walking for close to two hours looking at various places and menus.  \n\nFinally we came upon this place and it looked very quaint, with a full patio and outside heaters.  The maitre'd greeted us and informed us that their specialty was seafood, all fresh.  I love seafood so we were sold.  Went to sit inside since we were cold and wet, but as soon as went it, we started questioning our decision.  The place was dated, and not nearly as busy as the patio.  There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside.\n\nwe ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg.  They were covered in cheese and mushrooms (of which there was no mention of on the menu but i happen to like mushrooms so i did not complain).\n\nOn to mains.  Since they touted that they were known for their seafood i ordered the muscles and my partner ordered the fillet mignon.  Both were awful.  the filet tasted as if had been in the fridge for over 3 weeks - tough with a weird spongy time of texture, and very bad flavour.  The muscles were not fresh and many did not open during the cooking process.  The broth - the little that existed - had no flavour other than overly salty.\n\nVERDICT:::\nvery pricey, food quality sub par, service left much to be desired. I am surprised we did not get sick. I would not go back if you paid me."
0,DO NOT EAT HERE! I ate a chili dog last Thursday and I have been having the worst diarrhea for days. I'm writing this as I'm sitting on the pot and haven't been able to leave. What a shitty way to spend the days!!!!
4,amazing decor\n\ntry the entire menu\n\ndon't forget yak meat
0,"Forgive me, as I have been meaning to post this review for over a month now...\n\nThis is the closest Albertson's to my house, and yet I rarely go there. I find the prices to be too high compared to the other grocery stores in the area. And after my last visit I do not plan on going back. \n\nMy husband and I stopped in on July 3rd to pick up a couple specific items we needed for the upcoming holiday. One of the items we purchased was some mozzarella cheese. \n\nIt wasn't until I was home and I looked closer at the package that I realized the cheese we purchase had expired... BACK IN MARCH. Ugh. I could somewhat understand having expired products on the shelves if it was a matter of a couple days.. MAYBE even a week. But four months? That is unexcusable in my book and makes me wonder what other expired items are being sold at excessive prices.\n\nNever again Albertsons."
2,Doctors are great but the wait is loooooong...
3,"Been eating there tamales since I was a kid, so good!  But the last couple time I have gotten tamales the have been heavy on the corn meal and light on the meat.  I truely hope it was a new cook or something along those line.  But I have  feeling the are being \""cost effective\"".  Still good but not at the level they use to be at"
0,"I really, REALLY wanted to like this place.  How can you hate on a place that is decorated with teddy bears?  Seriously now... I'm like an overgrown she-child, so this place should have been paradise for me.  Instead, I left with a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively.\n\nIt took us ten minutes to be seated.  The woman at the cash register up front wasn't the hostess (I guess), so she left to find someone to seat us.  We waited FOR-E-VER for someone to finally show us to a table.  Then, we sat for another ten minutes after deciding what we wanted to eat for someone to come take our order.  I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup to start.  It was tepid at best and exactly the same consistency and overwhelmingly salty flavor as Campbell's Chunky soup.  For my meal, I ordered pot roast.  Over 50% of it was fat.  The sides were pretty nasty as well... a hard and cold baked potato and burned vegetables.  My fianc\u00e9's turkey dinner was so bad that he left it untouched like it was an alien life form.  \n\nThe service was the worst part.  From start to finish, the waitress was surly and rude.  It was like we were ruining her day by just being there.  I really, REALLY tried to be nice, but it seemed like she was more mean the nicer I got.  I couldn't WAIT to bolt out of there.\n\nSeriously, people.  There are better diners in this city.  Maybe I had a random bad experience, but besides the decor, there was nothing I liked about this place."
3,"I've gotta agree with the previous poster that this one particular Circle K is quite nice.  It must be a fairly new location.  They have a walk-in cooler where you can get larger quantities of alcohol.  They also have a large assortment of sunflower seed flavors which coincidentally is the exact reason we went.  The only gripe other than being above the average price for gas in the area is that the line was pretty long.  The 1 guy just kept ringing people up at 2 registers to keep it moving, but it still was a bit slow.  I'm definitely impressed by his work ethic though.  Some slightly shady looking people later at night when I went there though, but they might've just been shady looking and not actually shady."
3,Solid stadium and the higher seats have a surprisingly good view. The video is great and the sound is decent and a Panthers win always makes the experience much more memorable.
3,"Probably the best Half Moon location in town! \n\nEveryone's gotta love a good sports bar. This one is centrally located, close to my gym and set up nicely. They recently, well within the last year, renovated their patio, it needed it! They have a fun fireplace in the order, high top tables, a pool table and new flat screen tv's out there now. Inside, the bar is big, tons of TVs and a private room that you can reserve for you and your friends for less distraction while watching the game or fight. **They don't charge for Pay-Per-View fights!!! :-) \n\nAs I said in my review of other Half Moon's their food is really good for bar food and they have some of the best fries I have found in this state. I also recommend the Long Island Iced Tea, be careful though, more than two and you will be on your ass."
2,"After reading all the great reviews including the endorsements from my K-Town peeps, I went out on a limb and order jajangmyun and Korean fried chicken. Oh no. You guys really let me down. First, it wasn't authentic . . . which I suppose it doesn't have to be, but the recipe and delivery was also poor. I'll give this place another try because quite frankly if you want Korean in Charlotte, your choices are this limited."
1,"Six of us tried to go there for happy hour last night.  Of course, you can only take advantage of that menu and pricing in the bar/lounge area.  However, there are only 3-4 tables and a quarter circle bar, and it was packed (5:15 p.m. on a Thursday).  The rest of the dining room and the patio outside were EMPTY.  We asked if we could get the happy hour menu and pricing if we sat out on the patio.  The answer was \""no\"", even from the manager.  We ended up walking out and going to a more accomodating place down the street.  As we left, there were several other couples leaving for the same reason.    NOTE TO EDDIES - either expand the bar/lounge area, allow happy hour outside, or suffer the continued loss of business to other area places that are more accomodating."
