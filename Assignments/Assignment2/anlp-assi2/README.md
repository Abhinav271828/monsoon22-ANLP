# Code
There are two files in the submission:

* `data.py`, which contains classes for preprocessing the data and creating the datasets for both the tasks.
* `model.py`, which contains the class encoding the model itself.

Running the command `python3 model.py` trains the model on next-word prediction, followed by text classification, both for ten epochs each.
